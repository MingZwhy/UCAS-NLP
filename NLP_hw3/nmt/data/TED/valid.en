cars and trucks are very significant , and we have the lowest standards in the world .
but think for a moment what that means .
and since I &apos;m realistic , rather than grandiose , I don &apos;t claim that the ability to control the function of the nervous system will at once unravel all its mysteries .
this experiment revealed the first , and perhaps most fundamental , nugget of the neural code : that information is written in the form of electrical impulses .
the left and the right halves of the chamber are filled with two different odors , and a security camera watches as the flies pace up and down between them .
here &apos;s what happened in two instances : we &apos;re comparing two strains of flies , each of them having about 100 light-@@ addre@@ ss@@ able cells in their brains , shown here in green on the left and on the right .
we have created such a situation , artificially , by turning on the critic with a flash of light .
it &apos;s home to only 2,000 people , and like a lot of other small towns it has been hollowed out over the years .
so fast-forward to today , and we now live there .
there &apos;s space to experiment and to wel@@ d and to test things .
it &apos;s hands-on , it &apos;s in-@@ your-@@ face , it requires an active engagement , and it allows kids to apply all the core subject learning in real ways .
and during that time , they &apos;re doing everything from going out and doing ethno@@ graphic research and doing the nee@@ d-@@ finding , coming back into the studio , doing the brainstorming and design visualization to come up with concepts that might work , and then moving into the shop and actually testing them , building them , prototyping them , figuring out if they are going to work and refining that .
I &apos;ve become very close with them , and they &apos;ve welcomed me like family .
and I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud and was buried in the bli@@ zz@@ ard .
they were tired of ghost dances .
and how much of this history do you need to own , even ?
children have been trafficked from other conflict zones to come and work on the coffee plantations .
this substitute cost nine dollars a pound , whereas real he@@ par@@ in , the real ingredient , cost 900 dollars a pound .
and you can just look at the headlines .
ask yourself , is this company behaving in a socially responsible way ?
could the private sector and NGOs get together and mar@@ sha@@ l a response ?
I &apos;m an ecologist , and I study complexity . I love complexity .
basically , no one &apos;s very happy .
see , the thing we &apos;re doing right now is we &apos;re forcing people to learn mathematics .
and we open up so many more possibilities .
why is this ?
so I believe &#91; there is &#93; critical reform we have to do in computer-@@ based math .
I can , however , give you at least a taste of what I regard as the most powerful theory of beauty we yet have .
and also , for me , biking is a matter of empowerment .
that &apos;s what they had all their lives .
now , I &apos;ve got a story for you .
I have four kids , and even if part of what he says is true , they &apos;re not going to have the life that I had .
it &apos;s a tiny , little island -- 60 miles by 90 miles .
but since that happened , they own those desks .
these young ladies are living in a rice culture , but they know something that few people know in a rice culture .
but what it does mean is that a group of individuals can form a community to actually shape the way high seas are governed , to create a new regime .
unfortunately , the World Heritage Convention does not recognize the need to protect areas beyond national jurisdiction , at present .
at the same time we &apos;re saying , &quot; Yes , we need more . we need to move forward . &quot;
so my baby , Van@@ der , is eight years old now .
it requires only a change in consciousness , and that can be any one or a number of symptoms , including feeling fo@@ ggy , feeling dizzy , hearing a ringing in your ear , being more impulsive or hostile than usual .
we &apos;ve just rolled this out in the last couple months -- CO Kids With Brain In@@ jury .
now , I &apos;m not here to tell you what kind of legislation you should or shouldn &apos;t support , but I am going to tell you that , if it matters to you , your legislators need to know that .
but I think the worst kind of fear is the fear -- as Sa@@ mia , a Bos@@ nian woman , once told me , who survived the four-@@ years be@@ siege of Sarajevo ; she said , &quot; The fear of losing the &apos; I &apos; in me , the fear of losing the &apos; I &apos; in me . &quot;
you learn to play an international relations school on your way out and up to national and international leadership .
we are missing the story of F@@ are@@ eda , a music teacher , a piano teacher , in Sarajevo , who made sure that she kept the music school open every single day in the four years of be@@ siege in Sarajevo and walked to that school , despite the sni@@ pers shooting at that school and at her , and kept the piano , the violin , the cello playing the whole duration of the war , with students wearing their gloves and hats and coats .
we must have a full picture of what that means .
we taught her vocational and business skills . we helped her get a job .
I &apos;ve been asking people this question for about 10 years : &quot; where do you go when you really need to get something done ? &quot;
I did the sleep thing -- I went to bed , I laid down , but I didn &apos;t really sleep . &quot;
those are the real problems in the modern office today .
( Laughter ) We all know this to be true , and you would never see a spontaneous meeting called by employees .
what can managers do -- enlightened managers , hopefully -- what can they do to make the office a better place for people to work , so it &apos;s not the last resort , but it &apos;s the first resort , so that people start to say , &quot; When I really want to get stuff done , I go to the office . &quot;
we &apos;ve got bubbles going up there , then su@@ ds at the top with lu@@ mpy tiles .
then , another bathroom upstairs .
put it in the shower , or in the closet , but not in the foyer .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s how we process information .
so we hired on .
nothing wrong with that , unless you ask it to do what 12-@@ Gau@@ ge wire &apos;s supposed to do , and that &apos;s what happens .
that &apos;s why all sub@@ divisions look the same .
I see you don &apos;t have designer jeans .
what don &apos;t you do this ? why don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
I began to look into this stuff on the Internet , in books and in documentary films , in my travels with my family .
then we crossed the border into Syria , went to Ale@@ ppo , which , turns out , is named after Abraham .
but it &apos;s possible .
it depends on us taking the third side .
so let me invite you to consider taking the third side , even as a very small step .
some fruits get some insect damage .
furthermore , per kilogram of manure , you have much , much less am@@ monia and fewer greenhouse gases when you have insect manure than when you have cow manure .
so why not eat insects ?
Mar@@ cel Dic@@ ke : it &apos;s all protein .
actually , there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable in the environments where they &apos;re needed to produce , which is mainly in the developing world .
and they start to ask themselves what kind of political power and agency they have .
Thank you very much .
it turned out that the clothes I was sorting though at these thrift stores represented only a small fraction of the total amount of garments that we dispose of each year .
I don &apos;t want to defend the oil and gas industry but I &apos;d be lying if I said I was surprised to hear they were the number one pollu@@ ter .
and so what I &apos;m going to try to do today is to shake your confidence . because I know the feeling -- I can feel it myself .
it speaks so eloquently to the problem .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s in fact been a very interesting debate raging for over 20 years in cognitive science -- various experiments started by Roger She@@ pher@@ d , who measured the angular velocity of rotation of mental images .
what you &apos;re going to see is two pictures , one of which is slightly different from the other .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s easy .
that &apos;s a lot .
I think that if we reduce , reuse , refuse and recycle -- right at the end there -- recycling is the last point I want to make ; but it &apos;s the four R &apos;s , rather than the three R &apos;s -- then I think we &apos;re going to be on our way .
the problem is , the first two cases died in the county in which I work , and I could study them as part of my job .
but it turned out that the South did not take kindly to this poaching of its cheap labor .
and there are lovers of jazz who cannot imagine a world without John Col@@ tran@@ e having gotten a hold of a sa@@ x@@ oph@@ one .
( Applause )
and my aim , really , is to teach the world to listen .
if there were no reson@@ ators on here , we would have : ( Marimba sounds ) So he would have a ful@@ lness of sound that those of you in the front few rows wouldn &apos;t experience , those of you in the back few rows wouldn &apos;t experience , either .
do you see what I mean ?
this is how we experience music .
( drum sounds ) Like that , and then we get a little faster -- ( Drum sounds ) and a little faster -- ( Drum sounds ) and a little faster , and so on and so forth .
by the way , the pronunci@@ ation is &quot; E@@ y@@ j@@ af@@ j@@ all@@ a@@ jo@@ k@@ ull . &quot;
so I guess the world is insane , because I see entirely too much of doing the same things over and over again , hoping that this time it &apos;s not going to collapse upon us .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s 15 months older than Jay .
my brother , Henry , he died tragically when we were teenagers .
they called me Anthony growing up as a kid .
she &apos;s nude .
my father de@@ fied his own grandfather , almost to the point of dis@@ inheritance , because he decided to educate all four of us .
and the second thing , which has stayed with me , which became my philosophy of life , which made all the difference , is : 100 things happen in your life , good or bad .
you &apos;ve got to just respond to the situation .
I &apos;m going to take you on two journeys , my policing journey and my prison journey .
and write to me on Kir@@ an@@ Be@@ di@@ .com , and I &apos;ll respond to you .
but the difference is that , back then , it was driven by a very passionate feminist movement that was trying to project its own desires , whereas this time , it &apos;s not about passion , and it &apos;s not about any kind of movement .
and look at that last headline -- young women earning more than young men .
what it &apos;s about is that the economy has changed a lot .
what crazy person would pop their head through a glass ceiling ?
but what was interesting about this position I found myself in in Arizona , was I had this really extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with in a truly public school , and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities .
they find their twins , they stay with them for the whole year .
they come to business school precisely so that they can get great networks .
mark Gran@@ o@@ ve@@ tter , the sociologist , had a famous paper &quot; The Str@@ ength of We@@ ak T@@ ies , &quot; and what he did in this paper is he asked people how they got their jobs .
you &apos;re off to some particular destination .
and it &apos;s hard not to think that part of what leads to this sense of isolation is our modern world .
and ast@@ ound@@ ingly , 22 percent said they would hide a miscarriage from their spouse .
given a scene like this , a modern computer-@@ vision algorithm can tell you that there &apos;s a woman and there &apos;s a dog .
it might even be able to tell you that the dog is incredibly cute .
we have open-source tools for machine learning and intelligence that we can contribute to .
we already see and know this in the technology that we use today .
man : no . I didn &apos;t notice any of that .
what we find -- that one is also clearly affected by the questionnaire .
but it &apos;s one thing to talk about the brain , and it &apos;s another to see it .
so I &apos;ve always been fascinated with the hippocampus .
the more you &apos;re working out , the bigger and stronger your hippocampus and prefrontal cortex gets .
from going into the innermost workings of the brain , to trying to understand how exercise can improve our brain function , and my goal in my lab right now is to go beyond that rule of thumb that I just gave you -- three to four times a week , 30 minutes .
I want to understand the optimum exercise prescription for you , at your age , at your fitness level , for your genetic background , to maximize the effects of exercise today and also to improve your brain and protect your brain the best for the rest of your life .
so today I &apos;m going to talk to you about the rise of collaborative consumption .
I mean , we &apos;re monkeys , and we &apos;re born and bred to share and cooperate .
the reason why it &apos;s happening so fast is because of mobile collaboration .
well it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head , until actually I realized it was happening because of four key drivers .
they &apos;re increasingly thought of as the fifth &apos; R &apos; -- reduce , reuse , recycle , repair and redistribute -- because they stretch the life cycle of a product and thereby reduce waste .
but my favorite statistic is that 100 out of the 250 participants did not want their keys back .
I want to give you one example that shows how fast this evolution is happening .
my husband left me a year ago .
rather than wasting money on building walls , it would be better to spend on programs to help refugees to help themselves .
in my country , I lived already in the city , and we felt K@@ amp@@ ala was much better than a refugee camp .
so we felt that that day was the day that she really earned her name .
BJ : and then of course , the challenge is knowing when to turn around .
so what we watched over the next couple of hours was very unique .
and that &apos;s not the only leop@@ ards that were being killed through that period .
and of course , looking at this lion paw that has been skinned , it e@@ eri@@ ly reminds me of a human hand , and that &apos;s ironic , because their fate is in our hands .
and so we start our designs with that question .
so if you don &apos;t have an endgame of something delightful , then you &apos;re just moving chess pieces around , if you don &apos;t know you &apos;re taking the king .
that &apos;s the name of the first chapter -- &quot; This Book is Not a Tree . &quot;
so for any of us in this room today , let &apos;s start out by admitting we &apos;re lucky .
so I start looking around for moving boxes , figuring they just moved in , but I don &apos;t see any .
how do we change these numbers at the top ?
I know no women , whether they &apos;re at home or whether they &apos;re in the workforce , who don &apos;t feel that sometimes .
and I say , &quot; God , I really wish I had really connected John Loc@@ ke &apos;s theory of property with the philosophers that follow . &quot;
because no one gets to the corner office by sitting on the side , not at the table , and no one gets the promotion if they don &apos;t think they deserve their success , or they don &apos;t even understand their own success .
I wish I could tell that to my daughter .
( Applause )
she calculated the up-@@ front cost and the payback over time , and it &apos;s a net-@@ plus on so many levels for the local , national and global economy .
not quite an obvious alliance .
and she might not get to see that mountaintop .
they &apos;re not the largest number of people , but they are some of the most expensive -- and in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse , drug and alcohol abuse , poor performance by their kids in schools and also poor health as a result of stress .
even when we think or talk about recycling , lots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incin@@ erated or in landfills and leaving many municipalities , di@@ version rates -- they leave much to be recycled .
so I want everyone to understand the critical importance of shifting charity into enterprise .
I started my firm to help communities across the country realize their own potential to improve everything about the quality of life for their people .
I &apos;m going in , I &apos;m going to figure this stuff out , I &apos;m going to spend a year , I &apos;m going to totally deconstruc@@ t shame , I &apos;m going to understand how vulnerability works , and I &apos;m going to out@@ smart it .
and to me , the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that we &apos;re not worthy of connection , was something that , personally and professionally , I felt like I needed to understand better .
these are whole-@@ hearted people , living from this deep sense of worthiness .
( Laughter ) I was like , &quot; What does that mean ? &quot;
there &apos;s no conversation .
and the last , which I think is probably the most important , is to believe that we &apos;re enough .
dealing with other people demands a kind of flexibility that no set of rules can en@@ compass .
he made re@@ stitution and found himself a new job .
and it doesn &apos;t have to be this way .
so these are little ordinary , everyday heroes , and they &apos;re incredibly admir@@ able , but there &apos;s no way that they can sustain this kind of activity in the face of a system that either roots them out or grin@@ ds them down .
indeed , we argue , there is no substitute for wisdom .
my last book was about the story behind the Shi &apos;@@ a-@@ Sun@@ ni split , and for that , I &apos;d worked closely with the earliest Islamic histories , so I knew the events to which the Koran constantly refers , its frame of reference .
( Laughter ) I &apos;d set aside three weeks for this project , and that , I think , is what is meant by &quot; hubris &quot; -- ( Laughter ) because it turned out to be three months .
but all is not lost in translation .
the way that &apos;s done is by the following : there &apos;s something called B@@ OL@@ D imaging , which is Bloo@@ d Ox@@ y@@ gen Lev@@ el Dep@@ end@@ ent imaging .
one area turns on , and a big area shuts off , so that you &apos;re not inhibited , you &apos;re willing to make mistakes , so that you &apos;re not constantly shutting down all of these new generative impulses .
that was challenging .
there &apos;s a shortage of radiologists qualified to read mammograms , and that &apos;s because mammograms are one of the most complex of all radi@@ ology studies to interpret , and because radiologists are sued more often over missed breast cancer than any other cause .
the factor most responsible for that fire is breast density .
and I started talking to him about this problem with breast density , and we realized that we might be able to get this detector close enough around the breast to actually find small tumors .
the digital mammogram was read as normal and shows lots of dense tissue , but the MBI shows an area of intense uptake , which correlated with a two-@@ centimeter tumor .
we grew up taking for granted a lot of the things that my parents couldn &apos;t take for granted when they grew up -- things like power always on in our houses , things like schools across the street and hospitals down the road and pop@@ si@@ cles in the backyard .
in global terms , it &apos;s a little bit of money .
we &apos;re staring at everybody , waiting our turn to speak , and he leans over to me , and he says , &quot; Jo@@ dy , I &apos;m a Buddhist monk . &quot;
these are both very successful -- a physician in one case , a surgeon in the other .
( Laughter ) But they spent three and a half million dollars in the 2000 Super Bowl to air that ad , even though , at the time , they only had a million dollars in annual revenue .
with the electric industry you actually have to -- one of them is that they &apos;re both sort of thin , horizontal , enabling layers that go across lots of different industries .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a total , total mess .
( Laughter ) I challenge you to try . it &apos;s very hard .
my mom hates this picture .
but now what we &apos;re looking at is not an extension of the physical self , but an extension of the mental self , and because of that , we &apos;re able to travel faster , communicate differently .
it gets adopted because people use it and it &apos;s made for humans .
this room may appear to be holding 600 people , but there &apos;s actually so many more , because within each one of us , there is a multitude of personalities .
my years as a mystic have made me question almost all my assumptions .
and it &apos;s to help all of us , myself included , to counteract the tendency to other@@ ize .
video games are a symptom .
but here he stands as testament to the fact that you can &apos;t rough@@ house on the playground today .
another way that zero tolerance lives itself out is in the writing of boys .
&quot; I want to write about video games . I want to write about level@@ ing-@@ up .
it &apos;s not develop@@ mentally appropriate , and it &apos;s particularly bad for boys .
more specifically , we can do some very specific things .
I spent a week at sea on a research vessel .
so we have greed , we &apos;ve got over@@ confidence / hubris , but since we &apos;re here at TEDWomen , let &apos;s consider one other factor that could be contributing in some small way to societal reck@@ lessness .
now , you may have noticed more and more headlines like these .
seven weeks later , I got a call from my family .
I fell through my apartment door and crawled to the bathroom where I found my problem : I had forgotten to mix in the most important part of my medicine .
it turned out the team was actively working on two of those ideas and had seriously considered a third .
three : get the bigger picture .
and then you look at your colleague and say , &quot; Why , you cre@@ tin ! you put yours in the white bin . &quot;
that bottle winds up getting burned .
but if you create a world where you don &apos;t trash people , you can &apos;t trash the planet .
you can see that there is &#91; a &#93; scattering of X-rays on the teeth , the metal in the teeth .
the person was killed by st@@ abs in the heart , but they just deposited the knife by putting it through one of the eyeballs .
so if you have the opportunity , please try it out .
and then I can feel the brain inside , and this will be the sl@@ us@@ hy like this .
and this is something that we &apos;ve been researching for a little while .
some people in the last decade or two have started creating artwork with technology .
I actually have no idea what my robot is going to do today .
ready for some jokes ?
the world is changing with really remarkable speed .
well , I think it has all sorts of profound implications .
it &apos;s embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the West .
unfortunately , I think , I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Wester@@ ner mentality .
I mean , Europe once , of course , once comman@@ ded the future in its confidence .
it travels on rails down a suburban road , and the cars travel underneath it .
they know what they &apos;re supposed to be doing , but they &apos;re not doing it .
okay , I know where I sit . I know where I &apos;m situated .
finally , we need to be presented with a clear point of action .
you &apos;ve seen them all around , especially these days as ra@@ dar@@ s are cheaper .
it says very clearly what the drug is for , specifically who it is good for , so you can start to personalize your understanding of whether the information is relevant to you or whether the drug is relevant to you .
we give them some insight into what choices they can make , what actions they can take .
it works totally different from the way we talk about behavior in medicine today .
I found that I didn &apos;t have to wear high heels , I didn &apos;t have to wear pink , and I could feel like I fit in .
and for the next 38 years , that accident was the only medically interesting thing that ever happened to me .
I sort of friend@@ -@@ married each of these guys .
he was like , &quot; Yeah . cows sleep standing up .
&quot; will you help be their dad ? &quot;
and as he talked he had that gl@@ int in his eye that I first saw back in Holland -- the gl@@ int that says , &quot; Let &apos;s go cow tipping , &quot; even though we never did tip the cow , even though no one tips the cow , even though cows don &apos;t sleep standing up .
he said , &quot; I don &apos;t see the wall , &quot; and I &apos;m telling you the same , Don &apos;t see the wall .
and the answer is : not yet , they &apos;re working .
to conclude , this is just one cross-section of one piece of city , but my dream is , my hope is , that when you all go back to your own cities that we can start to work together and collaborate on re@@ making and reforming a new urban landscape towards a more sustainable , a more livable and a more delicious future .
I &apos;m going to have a pretty simple idea that I &apos;m just going to tell you over and over until I get you to believe it , and that is all of us are makers .
there was one held in Detroit here last summer , and it will be held again next summer , at the Henry Ford .
and it &apos;s a fabulous event to just meet and talk to these people who make things and are there to just show them to you and talk about them and have a great conversation .
but at one time , it was fairly commonplace to think of yourself as a maker .
and I don &apos;t know if you can see it that well , but that &apos;s a mailbox -- so an ordinary mailbox and an Arduino .
well , I actually don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to be the case .
I think that media companies are going to hire a lot more women , because they realize this is important for their business , and I think that women are also going to continue to dominate the social media sphere .
but my argument is that , if you want to understand the global village , it &apos;s probably a good idea that you figure out what they &apos;re passionate about , what am@@ uses them , what they choose to do in their free time .
( Laughter ) She was raised from neighborhoods in which there was racial violence and segregation , where she was chased out of neighborhoods , and she exac@@ ted violence to chase others out of hers .
do you understand what I &apos;m saying to you ?
how many of you ever give that talk ?
within 60 seconds , our brains go on lockdown .
and be specific , like the Native American girl at a Chicago fif@@ th-grade school said to me , &quot; I feel angry at a nine because I &apos;m the only Native American .

can they reduce their tsunami interpretation down to a mountain@@ -@@ climbing adventure that they can engage and not run away ?
when police and teachers see my children , I want them to imagine their own , because I believe if you see our children as your children , you won &apos;t shoot them .

what I thought I would do is I would start with a simple request .
he wants to get your cookies .
we can &apos;t carefully control them because they &apos;re subconscious for us .
so one of the things we really wanted to look at was not how much weight people lost , but really how long they interacted with the robot .
the last thing I want to talk about today is the future of children &apos;s media .
it &apos;s our home . we welcome them .
what matters is the chip count .
I don &apos;t know why , but I tell her something I hadn &apos;t told anyone .
you came with me to Sloan K@@ et@@ tering , because my family wasn &apos;t handy .

and compassion does seek physic@@ ality .
and at the same time that we are doing that , I think we are re@@ discovering the power of story -- that as human beings , we need stories to survive , to flourish , to change .
but here &apos;s a face from 20th century science that might surprise you in a discussion about compassion .
some of his favorites were Moses , Jesus , Buddha , St. Francis of A@@ ssi@@ si , Gandhi -- he adored his contemporary , Gandhi .
so I want to propose a final definition of compassion -- this is Einstein with Paul Ro@@ be@@ son by the way -- and that would be for us to call compassion a spiritual technology .
sorry , Dad .
what &apos;s the worst that could happen ?
my grandmother was a woman who took extraordinary pleasure in dressing up .
these conversations really reflect what &apos;s happening at the national and international level .
one of my favorite quotes from literature was written by Til@@ lie Ol@@ sen , the great American writer from the South .
because they &apos;re focused on honoring what is most beautiful about our past and building it into the promise of our future .
then they decided that they would do TEDx &apos;s .
and I have learned so much from Chris and Kevin and Alex and Her@@ bert and all of these young men .
and not only did those suicide bombers take a hundred lives , but they did more , because they created more hatred , more rage , more fear and certainly despair .
but I saw how the level of moral standard can rise from one person &apos;s action .
we need leaders .
I think it helps in terms of the support if there are other women in the room .
the other thing that I think is really important : a lot of national security policy isn &apos;t just about foreign policy , but it &apos;s about budgets , military budgets , and how the debts of countries work out .
as they listened to the experts &apos; voices , the independent decision-making parts of their brains switched off .
this doesn &apos;t mean having to get a Ph.D .
I &apos;ll get , &quot; Baby , just give me the fri@@ ck@@ in &apos; TV guide . &quot;

for this , we have to continuously and collectively work together .
the Iraqis : yes , they got rid of Saddam Hussein , but when they saw their land occupied by foreign forces they felt very sad , they felt that their dignity had suffered .
and actually other regimes , they told their citizens , &quot; Would you like to see the situation of Iraq ?
I thank you very much .
two weeks ago I was in my studio in Paris , and the phone rang and I heard , &quot; Hey , JR , you won the TED Prize 2011 .
I just took their pictures and pasted them .
I heard it was one of the most violent favelas , because the largest drug cartel controls it .
art . just doing art .
but there are places where you just can &apos;t paste on a wall .
and so in Pro@@ vi@@ den@@ cia , for example , in the favela , we have a cultural center running there .
when I do my work , I have two kinds of reactions .
and this starts right now and depends on you .
from just an idea that sounded crazy , you have the largest encyclopedia in the world .
the next day I was in Tahrir .
but I want to tell you , I think it &apos;s an important topic that we need to care about .
so you get a big squeeze .
there &apos;s ways , if it &apos;s temporary , to minimize the impact , but it &apos;s a problem .
or even if you &apos;re flat , you might shift money into it .
je : well , it &apos;s an honor and a privilege to meet you .
we are the most widely read feminist publication ever , and I tell you this because I think it &apos;s really important to see that there &apos;s a continuum .
I was fired up ; I was ready to make a difference .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There &apos;s a writer I &apos;ve been deeply influenced by , Parker Pal@@ mer , and he writes that many of us are often whi@@ pl@@ ashed &quot; between arrogant over@@ estimation of ourselves and a ser@@ vi@@ le under@@ estimation of ourselves . &quot;
the activists I interviewed had nothing in common , literally , except for one thing , which was that they all cited their mothers as their most looming and important activist influences .
this animal &apos;s fossils are only found in this area of South America -- a nice clean band here -- and this part of Africa .
red is wrong , blue is right .
I have to be clear , it &apos;s not just me anymore .
I &apos;m still doing all the videos , but we have a ro@@ ck-@@ star team doing the software .
it &apos;s actually been pretty interesting .
SK : absolutely . and this is something I recommend everyone in this audience do .
I think you just got a glimpse of the future of education .
so if algorithms are going to curate the world for us , if they &apos;re going to decide what we get to see and what we don &apos;t get to see , then we need to make sure that they &apos;re not just ke@@ yed to relevance .
that , in fact , you couldn &apos;t have a functioning democracy if citizens didn &apos;t get a good flow of information , that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter , and then journalistic ethics developed .
we need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives .
three of the key people in this project , Philip De@@ Camp , R@@ ony Ku@@ bat and Bran@@ don Roy are pictured here .
my mother &apos;s in the kitchen , cooking , and , of all places , in the hallway , I realize he &apos;s about to do it , about to take more than two steps .
can you do it ?
this is a river .
how did we get here ?
well , we decided to connect these two worlds -- the world of the companies with their water footprints and the world of the farmers with their senior water rights on these cre@@ eks .
and it &apos;s not based on theology or philosophy , it &apos;s in the study of the mind , across all these spheres of research , from neuroscience to the cognitive scientists , behavioral economists , psychologists , sociology , we &apos;re developing a revolution in consciousness .
we can &apos;t see them directly .
and if we were to fall towards this black hole , we would see all of that light len@@ sed around it , and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened .
it &apos;s like hurry , build your instruments .
I mean we have to ask , has it happened before ?
( Laughter ) I swear .
( Laughter ) I carried my payload back downstairs where I met my ne@@ mesis and the precious dog by the front door .
we completed a pilot of our technology that was run over a period of 120 days , covering all of South Africa .
and that is how , maybe in the near future , light can help hospitals to make people better sooner , recover them quicker .
so there he is with his little laptop computer , but fighting against the might of the pressures -- because of the debt , the foreign debt of Ecuador -- fighting the pressure of World Bank , IMF , and of course the people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil .
and we &apos;re using -- you can see that I &apos;m not really into this kind of stuff -- but we &apos;re using satellite imagery to look at the deforestation in the area .
but the point is that when I was first in Gom@@ be in 1960 -- I remember so well , so vividly , as though it was yesterday -- the first time , when I was going through the vegetation , the chimpanzees were still running away from me , for the most part , although some were a little bit ac@@ cli@@ ma@@ tized -- and I saw this dark shape , hunched over a ter@@ mite mound , and I peered with my binoculars .
the reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough is at that time , it was thought that humans , and only humans , used and made tools .
so that when Louis Lea@@ key , my mentor , heard this news , he said , &quot; Ah , we must now redefine &apos; man , &apos; redefine &apos; tool , &apos; or accept chimpanzees as humans . &quot;
they &apos;re disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well .
you &apos;re just smelling for smoke so you can follow the trail back to a burning house , so you can find the boy who lost everything in the fire to see if you can save him .
( Laughter ) Why was the scar@@ ec@@ row invited to TED ?
spoken-word poetry is the art of performance poetry .
I &apos;m so lucky that there &apos;s this archive of performances that I can share with my students .
and I &apos;m trying to tell stories only I can tell -- like this story .
I think December 5@@ 4th was probably supposed to be 24@@ th .
it only had 81 pages .
ever since that day , I &apos;ve been trying to apply the concepts in this passage to my day-to-day life .
we also live in a world today of constant change .
( Laughter ) And they have become my guiding principles in life .
I would love to hear from you .
I can &apos;t even name them all .
it &apos;s hard , time-consuming labor , which they have to do for hours every week .
and it &apos;s 12 units used in the entire world , and the richest one billion , they use six of them .
if we just pro@@ long the trends , without any real advanced analysis , to 2050 , there are two things that can increase the energy use : first , population growth ; second , economic growth .
( Laughter ) Ladies and gentlemen , meet your cousins .
it &apos;s where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game .
and if you can do it with monkeys -- though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate is actually between monkeys and apes -- if they can do it in monkeys , they can probably figure out how to do it in apes , which means they can do it in human beings .
they then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm , which you see here in the picture , put the arm in another room .
they self-@@ aggregated into a network , became an integrated chip .
obviously , this is resulting in some major complications -- back injuries , 30 percent of them -- chronic back injuries .

and so light sh@@ one upon the Dark Ages of Europe .
case in point , Einstein .
so we extracted and decom@@ piled the attack code , and we discovered that it &apos;s structured in two digital bombs -- a smaller one and a bigger one .
what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and creepy -- obviously in an effort to drive maintenance engineers crazy , that they would not be able to figure this out quickly .
these results have been obtained over several weeks of really hard labor .
it is Nat@@ an@@ z , and it is only Nat@@ an@@ z .
the idea is to circumvent a digital safety system .
this production was directed by South African artist and theater director , William K@@ ent@@ ridge .
AK : ha@@ a ha@@ a ha@@ aa .
BJ : from an actor .
AK : in Port Elizabeth , the village outside Port Elizabeth in South Africa .
and , in fact , it took about 10 years to discover the B@@ am@@ bara Ba@@ man@@ a puppets of Mali in West Africa , where there &apos;s a fabulous tradition of pup@@ pe@@ try , to learn a renewed , or a new , respect for this art form .
but because they have to be light and flexible , and each one of them is different , they can &apos;t be mass-@@ produced , unfortunately .
they were incredibly athletic , and I always participated from the sidel@@ ines , cheering on my three siblings or handing out water at local races .
that &apos;s right , it &apos;s a total distance of 14@@ 0.@@ 6 miles using just your arms in less than 17 hours .
( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) And it wasn &apos;t just any female athlete .
and when the doctor came in the room to prepare the shot , I asked him if I could take a picture to document the moment .
( Applause )
in fact , while we drove 14@@ 0,000 miles , people didn &apos;t even notice .
( video ) S@@ op@@ rano : ♫ Up@@ on my pillow ♫ ♫ Safe in bed ♫ E@@ W : that &apos;s Geor@@ gie from England . she &apos;s only nine .
yeah , I &apos;m sure a lot of you have heard that too .
&quot; it hurt so much , and I shed some tears , but something inside of me wanted to do this despite his words .
we don &apos;t usually think of our kitchen as an electrical engineering lab or little kids as circuit designers , but maybe we should .
think about watching your brother , father , daughter , son , wife in a fire@@ fight in real time and you can &apos;t do anything about it .
and Mat@@ thieu &apos;s happiness measure is off the charts .
and if you look at these qualities in the context of compassion , we find that the cognitive and affective components of compassion -- understanding people and empathizing with people -- inhibits , tones down , what I call the excessive self-@@ obsession that &apos;s in us , therefore creating the conditions for humility .
the motivational component of compassion creates ambition for greater good .
so I &apos;m an engineer by training , but I &apos;m one of the creators and instructors of this course , which I find kind of funny , because this is a company that trusts an engineer to teach emotion intelligence .
therefore , any curriculum for training emotion intelligence has to begin with attention training .
JK : both .
man : um , my brand ?
woman 2 : part hippie , part yo@@ gi , part Brooklyn girl -- I don &apos;t know .
according to Bur@@ rel@@ les , the movie premi@@ ered in January , and since then -- and this isn &apos;t even the whole thing -- we &apos;ve had 900 million media impressions for this film .
I was exposed to him .
so that started the journey .
Armstrong Twit@@ tered about us , and then in December , Time magazine honored us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010 , which was really cool .
and this is the question I want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done : if not now , then when ? and if not me , then who ?
do you know what I wanted to be ?
and for the next 11 years , I swore nobody would ever find out that I couldn &apos;t see , because I didn &apos;t want to be a failure , and I didn &apos;t want to be weak .
and temporarily , very unexpectedly , they dropped .
and they &apos;re being traded by a species of almost seven billion individuals , who are linked by trade , travel , and the Internet into a global system of stu@@ pend@@ ous complexity .
the complex things get more fragile , more vulnerable ; the Goldilocks conditions get more str@@ ingent , and it &apos;s more difficult to create complexity .
now what makes humans different is human language .
so what big history can do is show us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that face us , but it can also show us our power with collective learning .
Canada &apos;s currently led by a party that most Canadians didn &apos;t actually want .
( Applause )
even though we see time and again that it &apos;s the poorest of people who are the most vulnerable to extreme weather .
but if God can or will do these things -- intervene to change the flow of events -- then surely he could have stopped the tsunami .
perhaps , but these ideas are all just variations on God controlling everything , the supreme commander to@@ ying with expend@@ able units in a great campaign .
it needs a profound att@@ entiveness and a patient waiting , a contem@@ pla@@ tive attitude and a generosity and openness to those whose experience is different from my own .
when I stood up to speak to my people about God and the tsunami , I had no answers to offer them .
and it &apos;s not a banal story -- after the liberation he continued to make false papers until the &apos; 70s .
in order to do that , I set out to forge their signature .
all day he would ask many questions to his boss to learn , to accumulate more and more knowledge , and at night , when no one was looking , he &apos;d put his experience to practice .
there were obviously financial sacrifices because he always refused to be paid .
Roger E@@ bert : these are my words , but this is not my voice .
the first surgery was a great success .
I have learned from Wikipedia that , starting with that humble beginning , P@@ L@@ AT@@ O established forums , message boards , online testing , email , chat rooms , picture languages , instant messaging , remote screen sharing and multiple@@ -@@ player games .
we use words and communication to break out of it and to reach out to others .
people -- ( Applause ) People talk loudly -- I &apos;m so sorry .
a guy goes into a psychiatrist .
now to the ridicule of my colleagues , I inspired my lab to focus on what I thought was the most non-@@ controversial source of stem cells , adi@@ pose tissue , or fat , yes fat -- nowadays available in abundant supply -- you and I , I think , would be very happy to get rid of anyway .
there are 170 clinical trials investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease .
Thank you .
and we fight back , and it gets really ugly .
you want your kids to have a better life .
when oil was at stake , somehow , suddenly , things mattered .
you can &apos;t help but think that .
when you see them , they &apos;re something else .
it &apos;s an American , American soldiers , American woman who lost her loved one in the Middle East , in Iraq or Afghanistan .
in other words , as you heard Chris say , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about being wrong .
I &apos;ll give you an analogy .
right , Mr. CF@@ O , astrophysicist , ultra-@@ marath@@ oner ?
so we just insist that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe .
the first thing we usually do when someone dis@@ agrees with us is we just assume they &apos;re ignorant .
the miracle of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
( Applause ) Thank you guys .
but let me get to the talk -- I see the clock is running .
and I remember the last time I came back from India -- in my long white flowing robes and my big beard and my John Len@@ non glasses -- and I said to my father , &quot; Dad , I think I &apos;ve just about found spiritual enlightenment . &quot;
and so I apologize to them as well .
this is the World Peace Game . what is wrong with you ? &quot;
she was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a philosophical decision to attack in a peace game .
astronomers and cosmologists and physicists think that there is something called dark matter in the universe , which makes up 23 percent of the universe , and something called dark energy , which perme@@ ates the fabric of space-time , that makes up another 73 percent .
and that &apos;s the kind of poli@@ shing that these mirrors have endured .
and this particular balloon , because it has to launch two tons of weight , is an extremely huge balloon .
( Laughter ) &quot; Professor H@@ ord@@ ley was brought up to have total and un@@ questioning faith &quot; -- ( Laughter ) -- &quot; that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs . &quot;
he stood by it in the face of repeated calls for clari@@ fication or withdrawal .
there could be non-@@ lin@@ ear@@ ities , threshold effects .
as I thought about that later on , I came up with a saying , which is , &quot; I collect bad wines . &quot;
some have come and gone .
the year after it was finished in 2004 , you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months .
we get them from religion , from culture , teachers , elders .
models can come from the media , from our elected officials ...
we can do &quot; to the next harvest . &quot;
it &apos;s manipulation , but it can work .
after the epiphany of 2012 , we got back to work , real work , because we had to work out this theory , and we came up with a certain number of predictions to be tested in real life .
this abalone shell is a bio@@ composite material that &apos;s 98 percent by mass calcium carbonate and two percent by mass protein .
basically , it took a billion years to have life on Earth .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) L@@ ater in a lecture that he gave on clean energy , he pulled it out and said , &quot; And people at MIT , they give out periodic tables . &quot; so ...
basically , you make an amplification in the lab , and then you get it to self-assemble into a structure like a battery .
the slogan of the early &apos; 70s was &quot; Go to the people .
now this is people science .
and I thought this was so much better than making trucks .
as a matter of fact , Feynman , as a child , was very fascinated by this .
all of our old newspapers , we cut them into little squares .
then we sat in a circle with support , with help , from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation .
who else can I meet that I don &apos;t know , or that I &apos;m so different from ? &quot;
they &apos;re becoming like computers in open air .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every atom out there were becoming both a sensor and an actuator .
so that was the reason for the project .
this has been digitizing everything , knowledge , and making that accessible through the Internet .
so as a fashion designer , I &apos;ve always tended to think of materials something like this , or this , or maybe this .
we would like to know what .
we &apos;d like to understand that .
he gave lectures to Caltech graduate students that became &quot; The Feynman L@@ ec@@ tures on Gra@@ v@@ itation . &quot;
it &apos;s not true that we &apos;ve figured it out by now .
if you come back a billion years later and look at it again , it will be moving away faster .
there &apos;s a finite region of space that we have access to , surrounded by a horizon .
if the dark energy remains around , the stars around us will use up their nuclear fuel , they will stop burning .
you could be a random fluctuation out of the nothingness .
( Laughter ) Day two .
and the really wonderful thing about this is , when you &apos;re done , well -- you can eat it .
we &apos;re inundated with news all the time that the sea ice is disappearing and it &apos;s at its lowest level .
these little , fat dumplings , 15@@ 0-@@ pound bundles of blu@@ b@@ ber are the main@@ stay of the polar bear .
and the cod are there because they are feeding on all the cop@@ epo@@ ds and amphi@@ pods .
and people were like , &quot; We knew they were vicious . we knew they were . &quot;
they are 12 ft@@ . long , a thousand pounds .
his name is Gor@@ an E@@ h@@ l@@ me from Sweden -- Gor@@ an .
and so that didn &apos;t work .
she &apos;s about to let me know she &apos;s too frustrated with me .
so we tried something out , and we wrote a message in a piece of silk , which is right here , and the message is over there .
( Applause ) And the most remarkable feat is that my hand actually stayed still long enough to do that .
and maybe you can use that liquid K@@ ev@@ lar if you need something strong to replace peripheral veins , for example , or maybe an entire bone .
and so this allows for a controlled delivery of drugs and for re@@ integration in the environment in all of these formats that you &apos;ve seen .
using 3D ultrasound technology , we can now see that developing babies appear to smile , even in the womb .
smiling stimulates our brain reward mechanism in a way that even chocolate -- a well-@@ regarded pleasure induc@@ er -- cannot match .
so whenever you want to look great and competent , reduce your stress or improve your marriage , or feel as if you just had a whole stack of high-quality chocolate without in@@ curr@@ ing the cal@@ oric cost , or as if you found 25 grand in a pocket of an old jacket you hadn &apos;t worn for ages , or whenever you want to tap into a superpower that will help you and everyone around you live a longer , healthier , happier life , smile .
he had a gar@@ gan@@ tu@@ an ego .
it may still exist ; I don &apos;t know .
sometimes I would win , mostly he would win , but we both enjoyed them .
he said he had been absolutely convinced that this was necessary , a necessary part of the growing up of a young physicist .
( Laughter ) There went that theory , down the trash can of history .
and for some time , he was convinced this was the reason we got along so well .
it was a complicated theory ; I &apos;ll tell you what it was soon enough .
if we could activate cells , we could see what powers they can unleash , what they can initiate and sustain .
what if we could just turn off that brain for the brief amount of time until the seizure dies away , and cause the brain to be restored to its initial state , like a dyna@@ mi@@ cal system that &apos;s being co@@ ax@@ ed down into a stable state ?
I want to close on one story , which we think is another possibility , which is that maybe these molecules , if you can do ultr@@ ap@@ reci@@ se control , can be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic , an optical prosthetic .
I spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that .
and this is pair of cooling towers for an electricity sub@@ station next to St. Paul &apos;s Ca@@ the@@ dr@@ al in London .
but instead of what it is , our focus was on the way it worked .
in Shanghai , we were invited to build -- well we weren &apos;t invited ; what am I talking about .
and to make the project affordable , we focused our energy .
( Laughter ) A key thing was how people would interact .
( Laughter ) A very different feeling .
I &apos;d like to show you some ideas today of things that we &apos;re building .
as I approached this concrete building , these tiny little windows , barbed wire , high walls , observation towers , and on the inside , these cold , hard spaces , little light or air , the guards are screaming , the doors are clan@@ king , there &apos;s a wall of cells filled with so many black and brown bodies .
thousands of people will come here instead of going to court .
so it &apos;s this green campus filled with these circular structures for victim and off@@ ender dialogue .
so after this project , I didn &apos;t go into a thing where I &apos;m going to make a huge peacemaking center .
instead of building prisons , we could build villages on wheels .
so I want to take you on a trip to an alien world .
I study it because I think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most bioluminescence occurs .
personally , I think it &apos;s something sexy .
okay , so this next one is from the webcam , and it &apos;s going to be this pin@@ wheel display .
( Applause )
this is looking at another event . this is called Queen &apos;s Day .
kind of amazing what some people did .
and there were 7,@@ 5@@ 99 people that contributed to the project , or were unique IP addresses -- so about how many people contributed .
and there &apos;s a lot of reasons why I chose sheep .
and we started bouncing around ideas to make a collaborative music video project .
collaborator : I felt really sad when he died .
collaborator Two : it really allows this last recording of his to be a living , breathing memorial .
and you can also see the way that it was drawn .
as you can see , the virus stopped , and it stopped very , very fast .
the first is that , when we started trying to eradicate polio about 20 years ago , more than twice as many countries were infected than had been when we started off with smallpox .
they &apos;re right at the center of the whole thing .
and in the last six months , we &apos;ve had less places re@@ infected by polio than at any other time in history .
and what &apos;s it going to be like the next couple of years ?
the story I wanted to share with you today is my challenge as an Iranian artist , as an Iranian woman artist , as an Iranian woman artist living in exile .
if you &apos;re living outside like me , you &apos;re faced with life in exile -- the pain of the longing and the separation from your loved ones and your family .
it goes to 1953 when American CIA exercised a coup and removed a democratically elected leader , Dr. Mos@@ sa@@ de@@ gh .
so the rituals came that way .
maybe it &apos;s a problem of the political culture , and we have to think about how to change that political culture . &quot;
he has a book , &quot; Arabic T@@ hou@@ ght in the Liber@@ al Age , &quot; and the Liber@@ al Age , he defines as 19th century and early 20th century .
but the problem with this car was it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment , in a flat , closed-@@ off parking lot -- even the lanes defined by red traffic cones .
( Laughter ) But sometimes -- ( Laughter ) But sometimes I also do get -- I wouldn &apos;t call it hate mail -- but letters of really strong concern : &quot; Dr. Hong , are you insane , trying to put blind people on the road ?
so today , the things I &apos;ve showed you today , is just the beginning .
if I make this whole thing a little bit more personal and see what makes me happy as a designer , the easiest answer , of course , is do more of the stuff that I like to do and much less of the stuff that I don &apos;t like to do -- for which it would be helpful to know what it is that I actually do like to do .
well then , why is it doing this ?
salmon swim upstream to get to their spawning grounds , and lan@@ cet flu@@ kes comman@@ deer a passing ant , crawl into its brain , and drive it up a blade of grass like an all-@@ terrain vehicle .
well , most of the cultural spread that goes on is not brilliant , new , out-of-the-box thinking .
and that &apos;s what a meme is . it &apos;s an information packet with attitude .
but among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world thanks to our technology , are a lot of toxic ideas .
&quot; one has only to glance at its press films , fashion shows , beauty contests , ball@@ rooms , wine bars and broadcasting stations . &quot; memes .
so a few years ago , I set off to do just that .
we have a lot of data , so we have a lot of power .
but how do we figure out what &apos;s right and wrong ?
that &apos;s true no matter what thing you &apos;re talking about .
it wouldn &apos;t be a matter of just opinion or just appearances .
you just look at the consequences and see if , overall , it &apos;s for the good or for the worse .
if you feel that way , that &apos;s a utilitarian choice .
I am extremely dyslexic , and so reading is the hardest thing I do .
and then Steven Spielberg , of course , depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures .
so she sampled some material out of it .
and now they &apos;re making G@@ low-@@ rabbits and G@@ low-@@ all-@@ s@@ ort@@ s-@@ of-@@ things .
for two years , I searched for a fiber that could survive ultraviolet rays , salt , air , pollution , and at the same time remain soft enough to move flu@@ idly in the wind .
I got a call from a friend in Phoenix .
in 2007 , I decided that we needed to re@@ conceptualize how we thought about economic development .
at the next regularly scheduled election , Pep@@ e L@@ obo won in a landslide on a platform that promised reform , but reconciliation as well .
I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
the faces in the audience were very serious and attentive .
and the insight of President L@@ obo was that that assurance of enforcement that I was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in Honduras who had suffered for so many years from fear and distrust .
it easily could hold a thousand square kilometers .
to be part of the constitution , you actually have to pass it twice in the con@@ gress .
I don &apos;t want to say we give up entirely on anatomy .
I don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time , it feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us .
we don &apos;t have a situation that Iran has , for example , where a man who &apos;s sexually attracted to other men is liable to be murdered , unless he &apos;s willing to submit to a sex change , in which case he &apos;s allowed to live .
but when I was on the phone with him , asking why he &apos;ll do this surgery -- this was a very high-risk surgery -- his answer was that , in this other nation , these children were going to be treated very badly , and so he had to do this .
so I want you to imagine when , in a couple of years , we &apos;ve started to apply this clou@@ d-@@ based information , when we really have the AI physician and leverage our brains to connectivity to make decisions and diagnostics at a level never done .
we &apos;re now in the era of super-@@ enabling the surgeon , who can now go into the body and do robotic surgery , which is here today , at a level that was not really possible even five years ago .
we &apos;ll be predictive and know what you &apos;re likely to have .
what if we take a new device , knock out the nerve vessels that help mediate blood pressure , and in a single therapy , basically cure hypertension ?
still a phase I trial , but evolving .
because I know as a doctor , if someone comes to me with stage I disease , I &apos;m thrilled ; we can often cure them .
you see , it will swim forward when it &apos;s happy ; it will swim backward when it &apos;s trying to get away from something like , you know , a toxic chemical .
so the dots that you see there that are , let &apos;s say , behind everything , they &apos;re algae .
she mobilized resources for building the local health clinic and the maternity wing is named in memory of her .
I grew up in a farming community in western Kenya .
I just want to imagine what it would look like if everyone in this room -- a medical doctor , a parent , a lawyer , a philanthropist , whatever you are -- if you embraced isirika and made it your default .
I grew up in the middle of nowhere on a dirt road in rural Arkansas , an hour from the nearest movie theater .
so what happens is you dance on the grave , and after you &apos;ve done your dance , everyone to@@ asts you and tells you how great you are .
so he makes these interesting conversations about realism and mimicry and our drive to be fooled by great camouflage .
we don &apos;t need mechan@@ ized workers .
it &apos;s pretty gl@@ um .
now imagine your workplace .
( Laughter ) So in summary , we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave , but we don &apos;t need a workers &apos; revolution .
because we can &apos;t do it alone . we have to do it together , and together , if we do this and share these ideas on play , we can transform Bulgaria for the better .
as an iceberg melts , I am breathing in its ancient atmosphere .
when I was making my latest piece / pe@@ h-@@ LO@@ -@@ tah / I thought a lot about how soccer was a means for my own immigrant family to foster a sense of continuity and normality and community within the new context of the US .
but as I was moving away from the traditional classical repertoire and trying to find new ways of musical expression , I realized that with today &apos;s technological resources , there &apos;s no reason to limit what can be produced at one time from a single string instrument .
my great grandfather was Henry Ford , and on my mother &apos;s side , my great grandfather was Harvey Fire@@ stone .
there were some within Ford who believed that all this ecological nonsense should just disappear and that I needed to stop hanging out with &quot; environmental w@@ ack@@ os . &quot;
well I think you probably already have the picture .
and to connect our country after World War II , we didn &apos;t build more two-@@ lane highways , we built the interstate highway system .
so parking garages , buses , trains , they all operate within the same system .
but the potential of a connected car network is almost limitless .
we don &apos;t want to re@@ gress and lose that freedom .
let &apos;s have a look at the third question .
and poets , like other artists , play with those intuitive understandings .
and you know , an epiphany is usually something you find that you dropped someplace .
and you know , that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does .
Thank you .
but like any long length of charged wire , it also inadvertently became an antenna .
the mysterious noise that P@@ enz@@ ias and Wilson were listening to turned out to be the oldest and most significant sound that anyone had ever heard .
the first half of high school was the struggle of the manic episode , and the second half was the over@@ medications of these drugs , where I was sleeping through high school .
so it wasn &apos;t all the good side of the illness .
and so he started clustering it by category , and then he started using it , and then his friends started using it .
so you see up there one such object .
okay . right to left , how many ? okay .
most of you said U , which is right .
you might have encountered the st@@ uc@@ k-@@ key problem -- so basically the same symbol being repeated over and over again .
they have been saying that since the 1970s .
for me , it was 9@@ am on January 3 , 2007 .
there &apos;s so much about trust -- what sources of information can we trust ?
there &apos;s one in the skull , and then for good measure , I had these other tumors , including , by the time my treatment started , one was growing out of my tongue .
the punch line is that a year and a half later , I was there when this magnificent young woman , my daughter , got married .
patients are such an underutilized resource .
Thank you .
and it became known as &quot; Death Avenue &quot; because so many people were run over by the trains that the railroad hired a guy on horse@@ back to run in front , and he became known as the &quot; West Side C@@ ow@@ boy . &quot;
mayor Gi@@ u@@ li@@ ani wanted to tear it down .
there &apos;s three sections .
( Laughter ) Even last year , I ended up hiking up Mt . K@@ ili@@ man@@ jar@@ o , the highest mountain in Africa .
none of the techniques that these people have developed over the course of the last 20 years is in any of those books .
( Applause ) A friend of mine complained that this was too big and too pretty to go in the kitchen , so there &apos;s a sixth volume that has was@@ hable , waterproof paper .
( Laughter ) Here we see y@@ lan@@ g y@@ lan@@ g , the component of many perfu@@ mes .
and what a wonderful thing it is .
and the reason it connects us with consciousness today is that all of us still today , the very first shape we draw as a child is a circle .
that is the consequence of more than a third of the right side of my brain being destroyed by the stroke .
Alfred Mann is a brilliant physicist and innovator who &apos;s fascinated with bridging gaps in consciousness , whether to restore hearing to the deaf , vision to the blind or movement to the paralyzed .
and if I do this , probably the mic won &apos;t hear it .

there are literally young black boys who have never seen a black man reading .
the mission is simple : to help young black boys identify as readers .
barbershop Books connects reading to a male-@@ centered space and involves black men and boys &apos; early reading experiences .
let &apos;s do something really simple .
her face was dirty and tear@@ stained ; her shirt was ripped and covered in blood .
I was running away from home , sleeping rough on the streets in London .
not in your life , in your day .
and then , in 2013 , picking up on that whole issue and the new stigma of loneliness , I launched a new national hel@@ pline in the UK for older people , called The Silver Line , which is there to support lonely and isolated older people .
silver Cir@@ cles are group conference calls where people actually talk about shared interests .
but this is a website called Ros@@ pil that &apos;s an anti-@@ corruption site .
you have situations , for instance , in France where president Sar@@ ko@@ zy tells the CEO &apos;s of Internet companies , &quot; We &apos;re the only legitimate representatives of the public interest . &quot;
how I define the age of behavior is a period of transnational allegi@@ ances , where identity is defined more so by ideas and narratives .
so the ideas and the narratives of Al-Qaeda come to your mind immediately .
mass movements in Pakistan have been represented after the Arab upri@@ sings mainly by organizations claiming for some form of theo@@ cracy , rather than for a democratic uprising .
and it &apos;s with that thought that I &apos;ll end .
but he doesn &apos;t know whether it &apos;s an infection , whether it &apos;s to do with malnutrition .
Cochrane , he starts ran@@ ting at these Germans in this Scottish accent -- in fluent German , by the way , but in a Scottish accent -- and explains to them how German culture was the culture that gave Sch@@ iller and Go@@ e@@ the to the world .
and he had a name for it .
I see it in the politicians we vote for -- people who , in the face of an incredibly complicated world , are nevertheless absolutely convinced that they understand the way that the world works .
but a typical Hans Rosling graph : think for a moment , not what it shows , but think instead about what it leaves out .
I could give you all kinds of facts and figures about the U.S. economy , but I think the most salient one is this : ten percent of American businesses disappear every year .
and Archie Cochrane understood this as well as anybody .
they knew that their hospitals were the right place for patients , and they knew it was very unethical to run any kind of trial or experiment .
he has been very supportive of me .
a lot of young girls look up to me .
they think that if there &apos;s anything against them , then we are being an opposition newspaper .
think about all the services we use , all the connectivity , all the entertainment , all the business , all the commerce .
in fact , if I just connect back to our lab systems through the Web , we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses , how many new examples of malware we find every single day .
so how do these guys then mone@@ tize those infected computers ?
and we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs , and one of them mentioned , well , it ends in R@@ US like Russia .
for example , the elevators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these .
we have become very reliant on Internet , on basic things like electricity , obviously , on computers working .
another world was opening up around this time : performance and dancing .
and in that disconnected state , yeah , we can build factory farms with no windows , destroy marine life and use rape as a weapon of war .
what &apos;s your act two ?
this is some mathematicians at MIT .
it is extremely unlikely the Taliban would ever be able to take over the country -- extremely unlikely they &apos;d be able to seize Kabul .
they simply don &apos;t have a conventional military option .
well first see , if you put 125 billion dollars a year into a country like Afghanistan where the entire revenue of the Afghan state is one billion dollars a year , you drown everything .
we need to somehow get their message to the policymakers .
we should have limited ourselves very , very strictly to the protection of the civilian population in Beng@@ haz@@ i .
one of the things I did not stress in that introduction was that , systematically , the pace of life decreases as you get bigger .
and any infrastructure you look at -- whether it &apos;s the length of roads , length of electrical lines -- anything you look at has the same economy of scale scaling in the same way .
on the left is the heart rate showing biology .
it &apos;s the same plot .
she was like , &quot; No , they do like you .
I was like , OK .
and let your presence be a gift .
many sociologists like Ve@@ bl@@ en and Wol@@ fe would argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously is because we &apos;re sno@@ bs , because we &apos;re focused on status .
how do you make children not just be more likely to eat carrots and drink milk , but to get more pleasure from eating carrots and drinking milk -- to think they taste better ?
it will make a difference if you were to discover that the person you &apos;re looking at with lust is actually a disguised version of your son or daughter , your mother or father .
this is why spouses in happy marriages tend to think that their husband or wife looks much better than anyone else thinks that they do .
so it was a series of five painful shocks .
and I found myself in the places where people are fighting every day to survive and can &apos;t even obtain a meal .
first , I &apos;ll ask you : why should you care ?
but they &apos;ve never had the ability to build even the basic infrastructure or the resources .
well , the World Bank estimates it would take about 10 billion dollars -- 10@@ .@@ 3 -- to address malnutrition in those countries .
( Laughter ) And my question to them would be , &quot; Well , do you know mal@@ ak@@ wan@@ g ? &quot;
and I got to go talk to one professor , Dr. Jac@@ obs , who accepted me into the lab .
and being naive about the whole field , I kind of thought , &quot; Oh , you have cell death in Alzheimer &apos;s which is causing the memory deficit , and then you have this compound -- pur@@ ine derivatives -- that are promoting cell growth . &quot;
some articles even went as far as to say that skeletal muscle tissue is resistant to cancer , and furthermore , not only to cancer , but of metastases going to skeletal muscle .
and the other really interesting thing is that when skeletal muscle -- there &apos;s been several reports that when skeletal muscle is injured , that &apos;s what correlates with metastases going to skeletal muscle .
if I left this pink noise on for more than a couple of minutes , ( Pink noise ) you would literally cease to hear it .
many people take refuge in headphones , but they turn big , public spaces like this , shared soundscapes , into millions of tiny , little personal sound bubbles .
I call that the &quot; hidden choir &quot; -- it &apos;s around us all the time .
now sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .
and I think as that happens , it &apos;s going to become possible for our digital person@@ as to continue to interact in the real world long after we &apos;re gone thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we &apos;re creating and technology &apos;s ability to make sense of it all .
now in closing , I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality -- and if so , what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it .
there &apos;s another problem .
so not only do we have this huge amount of spectrum , let &apos;s compare that with a number I &apos;ve just mentioned .
can we use them for communications ?
an LED is a semiconductor . it &apos;s an electronic device .
we fit in an LED light bulb , worth three U.S. dollars , put in our signal processing technology .
now we can in fact see where the data is going to .
and even this picture has the suspicious ta@@ int of being rigged about it -- something from a Bar@@ nu@@ m &amp; amp ; B@@ ai@@ ley circus .
we can benefit from others &apos; ideas .
so what you do one day is you take a pile of arrowheads , and you walk up to the one that can &apos;t speak very well , and you put the arrowheads down in front of him , hoping that he &apos;ll get the idea that you want to trade your arrowheads for finished arrows .
that &apos;s something on the order of 1.@@ 45 billion U.S. dollars on translation costs alone .
S@@ van@@ te found that the FOX@@ P@@ 2 gene , which seems to be associated with language , was also shared in the same form in Neanderthals as us .
if you look at the y-@@ axis of this graph , you &apos;ll see that , in the mechanically ventilated air , you have a higher probability of encountering a potential pathogen , or germ , than if you &apos;re outdoors .
and when you &apos;re outdoors , that type of air has microbes that are commonly associated with plant leaves and with dirt .
I heard people mur@@ mur from time to time that I should love my body , so I learned how to do this .
it was proof that I had not measured up , that I was old and not fabulous and not perfect or able to fit into the predetermined corporate image in shape .
I went outside what I thought I knew .
now I make a daily pilgrimage to visit a particular weeping wil@@ low by the Se@@ ine , and I hunger for the green fields in the bush outside Bu@@ k@@ av@@ u .
the flowers make it beautiful , and the honey makes it sweet . &quot;
it was magic heal@@ ers and ar@@ omatic oils .
it turns out , from earliest childhood , boys , and then men , prefer the company of guys -- physical company .
( recording ) K@@ W : with everything that you went through with your children , what is any advice that you would give me if I had any kids ?
EA : for folks who look like me , the easiest and most comfortable thing to do is to not pay attention -- to assume our criminal legal system is working .
EA : I &apos;ve been using the pronouns &quot; us &quot; and &quot; we &quot; because this is our criminal legal system and our children .
across the country , over the last couple of decades , as property and violent crimes have both fell , the number of prosecutors employed and cases they have filed has risen .
and third , can we do anything about this fo@@ g@@ gin@@ ess , can we train our brain to pay better attention ?
and what we do is we ask our participants as they &apos;re viewing a series of these types of overlaid images , to do something with their attention .
and it does so very fast .
and under stress , it &apos;s even worse -- we mind-@@ wander more powerfully and more often .
it &apos;s about keeping that button right on play to experience the moment@@ -to-@@ moment unfolding of our lives .
he said that unlike last time , after this deployment , they were much more present .
this is Vancouver &apos;s propaganda about how green a city they are .
and I want to tell you why I feel so strongly about this .
and the scene inside of this building was devastating and surreal .
so the day after we arrived , two of us from the aquarium were put in charge of room two .
so in a panic , Est@@ elle from SA@@ N@@ C@@ CO@@ B called the student and said , &quot; Please , you have to make more ! &quot;
( Applause )
one of the first letters was from the Dalai Lama .
well not thousands -- hundreds of people , lots of people -- all the press , because we were going to try and create the first ever World Peace Day , a peace day .
( Applause ) And like the General Assembly , obviously the most wonderful , wonderful moment .
and that completely blew my mind almost more than anything .
he &apos;s an amazing man .
it &apos;s all about partnerships .

you can call it suburban sprawl .
this is really , in fact , a television broadcasting a show 24 / 7 called &quot; We &apos;re Nor@@ mal . &quot;
we are sleep@@ walking into the future .
planetary systems outside our own are like distant cities whose lights we can see tw@@ inkling , but whose streets we can &apos;t walk .
to give you some perspective , in the previous two decades of searching , we had only known about 400 prior to Kepler .
the Chinese general Sun Tz@@ u said that all war was based on deception .
Announcer : one five will get you 10 , 10 will get you 20 .
you deceived yourself .
do you have some kind of per@@ verted pleasure from this ?
in my mind , I was actually a knight trying to help science move along .
and later , between 100 and 50,000 years ago or so , went out of Africa to colonize the rest of the world .
and the way to ask that question is to look at the Neanderthal that comes from Southern Europe and compare it to genomes of people who live today .
the next one questions that and looks at passive nature , or passively trying to have recon@@ figur@@ ation program@@ ma@@ bility .
why don &apos;t we train our children in compassion ?
and the anthropologist Rand@@ all White has made a very interesting observation : that if our ancestors 40,000 years ago had been able to see what they had done , they wouldn &apos;t have really understood it .
in the ancient world there was a lot of respect for unintended consequences , and there was a very healthy sense of caution , reflected in the Tree of K@@ now@@ ledge , in Pandora &apos;s Box , and especially in the myth of Pr@@ ome@@ theus that &apos;s been so important in recent metaphors about technology .
and this was the result of the tragic loss of lives of people who could not get into them .
and Che@@ ster Carl@@ son , the inventor , was a patent attorney .
so here &apos;s some inorganic life .
of course , they &apos;re not alive .
we &apos;re awfully careful in the lab to try and avoid various bio@@ hazards .
so there are two options : intelligent design , direct and indirect -- so God , or my friend .
if we manage to do that , forget the molecular detail .
Lee C@@ ron@@ in : so many people think that life took millions of years to kick in .
I &apos;m an artist and a dad -- second time around .
you can do all those fun things .
you can draw , as everyone should .

Ap@@ pro@@ TE@@ C is a company started by Dr. Martin Fisher , who &apos;s a good friend of mine . he &apos;s a Ph.D. from Stanford .
it can plan for the long-term benefits of the country and in the process , evic@@ t millions of people -- that &apos;s just a small technical issue .
and you need a strong government to do that , because you cannot respect private property rights .
so exactly why did China grow so much faster ?
isn &apos;t it true that the one-party political system has facilitated economic growth in China ?
China , I believe , still has some of the excellent raw fundamentals -- mostly the social capital , the public health , the sense of egal@@ itarianism that you don &apos;t find in India .
it might surprise you .
some of these churches and mosques are world-class , with excellent audi@@ o-@@ visual systems , wonderful meeting spaces , and they organize events that rival international concerts .
anonymous : dear Fox News , it has come to our unfortunate attention that both the name and nature of Anonymous has been ravaged .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : so your idea worth spreading is hire hackers .
( Laughter ) And so actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange , but is serves to absorb the specificity of the words that are delivered .
and so kind of thinking about scale , my most recent obsession is actually with glaciers -- of course .
when I meet a glacier for the very first time , what do I do ?
do you think that &apos;s not going to happen ?
take a look at this .
so why ?
( Laughter ) Let me very briefly tell you what I mean by this , synthesizing the work of many economic historians in the process .
in terms of patents , there &apos;s no question that the East is ahead .
so I want to end with three questions for the future billions , just ahead of 2016 , when the United States will lose its place as number one economy to China .
warning : that may not work .
and third , can China do without killer app number three ?
what we &apos;re left with is a collection of five million books , 500 billion words , a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome -- a text which , when written out , would stretch from here to the Moon and back 10 times over -- a ver@@ itable shard of our cultural genome .
so if you want to become famous early on , you should be an actor , because then fame starts rising by the end of your 20s -- you &apos;re still young , it &apos;s really great .
if the suppression index is very , very , very small , then you very well might be being suppressed .
and so you too can type in any word or phrase that you &apos;re interested in and see its n-@@ gram immediately -- also browse examples of all the various books in which your n-@@ gram appears .
but it turns out this is just a reminder that , although this is a lot of fun , when you interpret these graphs , you have to be very careful , and you have to adopt the base standards in the sciences .
what &apos;s going on in the street in Mumbai ?
in the best of times it puts strain on our resources .
on July 27 , the president of Liberia imposed quarantine on the worst-@@ affected areas .
our unit provided hope for thousands of patients , families and communities .
everyone was counted as a potential contact .
I was stigmatized .
they underwent quarantine for 21 days in our unit and were not arrested .
some survivors experience stigma@@ tization every day , in many ways .
however , there are successful interventions for prevention .
that &apos;s how families are torn apart .
she became blind as the result of Ebola .
a budding young naturalist who loved turtles , he immediately settled on the Galapagos .
the results were terrific .
unfortunately , it happens all the time .
and they helped me understand that rituals are all about transformation .
I &apos;m not sure why you &apos;re laughing .
where it comes from is an organization called the Young Foundation , which , over many decades , has come up with many innovations in education , like the Open University and things like Ex@@ tended Scho@@ ols , Scho@@ ols for Social En@@ treprene@@ urs , Summer Univer@@ sities and the School of Everything .
and it spread because of the power of an idea -- so the very , very simple idea about turning education on its head and putting the things which were marginal , things like working in teams , doing practical projects , and putting them right at the heart of learning , rather than on the edges .
you go to the website , fill out the form , give them $ 60 , it arrives in the post .
but that sounds really tec@@ hie , right ? that &apos;s a technical term .
you can give the competing drug in too low a dose , so people aren &apos;t properly treated .
but -- and it &apos;s a big but -- ( Laughter ) it turns out , when you look at the methods used by indu@@ str@@ y-@@ funded trials , that they &apos;re actually better than independently sponsored trials .
so they all cluster together .
we already have the data showing it reduces the duration of your flu by a few hours .
originally , when pencils were handmade , they were made round .
it &apos;s their space , it &apos;s a gir@@ l-@@ power space .
but then we are also so fortunate to witness the transformation of the whole country .
but then sometimes I &apos;m thinking , what are today &apos;s young generation up to ?
so today I want to talk about young people through the platform of social media .
now it &apos;s 0.5 -- even worse than that in America -- showing us the income inequality .
( Laughter ) And I can see their point , because I started my career as a theoretical nuclear physicist .
I &apos;m going to tell you about how I learned something about life .
so can life be defined ?
any time there is a program that &apos;s better at surviving in this world , due to whatever mutation it has acquired , it is going to spread over the others and drive the others to extinction .
and I &apos;m going to leave you with that .
and thank you very much .
but my parents did not allow the circumstances of their bad upbringing to determine the ambition and dreams for themselves and for their children .

I bet most of us have experienced at some point the joys of less : college -- in your dorm , traveling -- in a hotel room , camping -- rig up basically nothing , maybe a boat .
he actually had a meeting two blocks from here , in 1914 , in California Hall , and he brought together the park superinten@@ dents and a few other people who cared about this idea of conservation .
I love that .

it &apos;s removed some of my paralysis .
and in my classes , there were students up to the age of 21 .

these are some of the things that the US needs to be doing more to correct .
whereas , if you do the likely thing , put the block on the detector , it will only activate two out of six times .
when children do experiments we call it &quot; getting into everything &quot; or else &quot; playing . &quot;
I felt a sense of relaxation temper@@ ed with anticipation .

are you ready ? okay .
they &apos;re the things that you &apos;d snat@@ ch if the house was on fire .
well , imagine that you &apos;re an ambitious young scientist .
but today , we have new technologies , we have new opportunities to share our knowledge in new ways and the ability to create tools that actually allow us to solve problems in entirely new ways .
now , that smile is known in the trade as &quot; du@@ ping delight . &quot;
now here &apos;s the deal .
and that -- maybe it &apos;ll fade too with time -- but I don &apos;t think so .
you start up that path of being just a little bit more explicit , because you signal to everyone around you , you say , &quot; Hey , my world , our world , it &apos;s going to be an honest one .
but our current funeral practices make the situation much worse .
that is where we want you to try crazy ideas .
so when I said that , they said , &quot; Well show us what is possible . what are you doing ?
and everything works off the sun for the next 25 years .
he said , &quot; Do you know there &apos;s a solar-@@ electrified village in Sierra Leone ? &quot;
&quot; what happens if she runs off with an Indian man ? &quot;
I &apos;ll end with a quotation by Mahatma Gandhi .
( Applause )
and these scientists , instead of laughing at us , said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
and translating that complexity to machines is what makes them modern-day moon@@ shots .
and what ends up happening is that as participants we start to learn the level of detail that we need in order to manage expectations from both humans and machines .
Thank you .
this is one , too , because when we understand how brains work , we &apos;ll be able to build intelligent machines .
I can &apos;t be just a bunch of cells . &quot;
you still have that allig@@ ator brain . you do . it &apos;s your emotional brain .
and it &apos;s this feeding back into the old brain that will allow you to make more intelligent decisions .
you &apos;re constantly making predictions about your environment .
we test it by prediction : what is the next word in this ... ?
it &apos;s also memory of sequences : you cannot learn or recall anything outside of a sequence .
so you &apos;re not going to see C-@@ 3@@ PO .
but it &apos;s going to be big ! &quot;
for the correct functioning of our society in an I@@ o@@ T world , trust in the systems that support these connected devices is vital .
well the body works by starting a motor command in your brain , going down your spinal cord , out the nerves and to your periphery .
you can see the movements on his chest , and those little hash marks are where we put our antennae , or electrodes .

and then you can just walk behind them and try them on .
this , of course , is the Detroit that your hear about .
the population of the Detroit metro area itself has largely remained steady since the &apos; 70s .
well , I couldn &apos;t have been more wrong .
for those of us coming in , it means we must make sure we aren &apos;t inadvertently contributing to the destruction of community again , and to follow the lead of those who have been working on these problems for years .
and as I was coming back , well I was taken by the FBI , met by an FBI agent , and went into a little room and he asked me all sorts of questions -- &quot; Where were you ? what were you doing ? who were you talking with ?
you don &apos;t have to waste your energy or your resources .
and after piec@@ ing together this , this and this , this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself eventually evolved into this , and it actually became this project .

I think they kind of like to look at art .
but in humans , it was only known to facilitate birth and breastfeeding in women , and is released by both sexes during sex .
after they watched the video , we had them rate their feelings and took blood before and after to measure oxytocin .
it &apos;s empathy that makes us moral .
a then unknown philosopher named Adam Smith wrote a book in 17@@ 59 called &quot; The Theory of M@@ oral S@@ enti@@ ments . &quot;
two weeks ago , I just got back from Papua New Guinea where I went up to the highlands -- very isolated tribes of subsistence farmers living as they have lived for millen@@ ia .

it wasn &apos;t only about these documents being complex and annoying , it was the fact that Portuguese people &apos;s literacy -- literacy is the ha@@ bility to understand written documents -- is extremely low . I &apos;m going to show you a chart about Portuguese people &apos;s literacy &#91; rate &#93; .
I &apos;m going to give you an example of mistakes that were committed , bad decisions made for not being able to understand documents .
and we have to understand another thing too , which is : he who writes , has to write in order to be understood .
how do we get there ?
I &apos;ve seen all of this . these are excuses .
and how do you do that ?
so what are these characteristics that I &apos;m talking about ? these are them .
consider for a moment this quote by L@@ edu@@ c , a hundred years ago , considering a kind of synthetic biology : &quot; the synthesis of life , should it ever occur , will not be the sensational discovery which we usually associate with the idea . &quot;
however , to me , the 500 is really just the first 500 .
Thank you .
there &apos;s the cerebellum ; that &apos;s keeping you upright right now .
so there &apos;s about 86 billion neurons in our brain .
the unique character of both individual neurons and neurons within a collection of the brain are driven by fundamental properties of their underlying biochemistry .
so we collect this MR .
you could consider this state boundaries , if you will , those pretty broad outlines .
this is a more detailed map .
and we get confirmation .
one other thing you can do with such a thing is you can , because it &apos;s a pattern matching exercise , because there &apos;s unique fingerprint , we can actually scan through the entire genome and find other proteins that show a similar fingerprint .
most of you are probably familiar with gen@@ om@@ e-@@ wide association studies in the form of people covering in the news saying , &quot; Scienti@@ sts have recently discovered the gene or genes which affect X@@ . &quot;
one is called RE@@ LN -- it &apos;s involved in early developmental cues .
we had people jumping up and down , people dropping to the ground .
so a very diverse group of people .
and that was done also without permission , although no one seemed to care .
so the market is there .
in tourism , in many African countries , a great opportunity .
this is better than the performance of many OECD countries .
and I want to just make one point about this investment .
think about the Beatri@@ ces , think about the A@@ deni@@ kes of this world , who are doing incredible things , that are bringing them into the global economy , whilst at the same time making sure that their fellow men and women are employed , and that the children in those households get educated because their parents are earning adequate income .
one of the fascinating things about what we were working on is that we were seeing , using new scanning technologies , things that had never been seen before .

it is purely your body , and the wings become part of the body and vice versa ?
YR : yeah , two-@@ meter span .
I can release my wing when I am in a spin or unstable .
so I did try to take , again , a climb altitude .
so I was at my minimum altitude in that vector -- fast -- so I pulled that .
( Laughter ) YR : no , that &apos;s really two worlds .
it &apos;s possible to start already now , it &apos;s just too dangerous .
well , this is how I approached it , this is what I did .
I &apos;ve gotten a lot of interest and encouragement from my family , friends , teachers and even people at the Apple St@@ ore , and that &apos;s been a huge help to me .
these days , students usually know a little bit more than teachers with the technology .
in fact , the way that you say &quot; hello &quot; in Ku@@ uk Tha@@ ay@@ or@@ re is you say , &quot; Which way are you going ? &quot;
no ; if your language and your culture trains you to do it , actually , you can do it .
so here I have pictures of my grandfather at different ages .
they don &apos;t use words like &quot; left &quot; and &quot; right . &quot;
you learn the number list and you learn how to apply it .
in English , quite weirdly , we can even say things like , &quot; I broke my arm . &quot;
but scientists have for a long time thought this just was never going to be possible .
she says , &quot; I &apos;m 60 . &quot;
and it &apos;s just sitting on one of them .
so I &apos;m really optimistic , and I think it won &apos;t be too long , I hope , before this age-old dream begins to come true .
if you knock them out completely , then you &apos;re very sick .

and when you look at these 70 year-old turtles , you can &apos;t tell the difference , just by looking , between those turtles and 20 year-old turtles .
you think , what should I do ?
in the words of Judy , that produces an intrinsic reinforcement that causes you to go back and keep seeking that activity over and over again .
this is already starting to have a tremendous effect on society .
a simple definition of gamification is it &apos;s the process of using game thinking and game mechanics to engage audiences and solve problems .
today , if you buy a hybrid or an electric vehicle , you &apos;ll almost certainly see the product of a hundred million dollars &apos; worth of tool@@ ing and research and development , in the form of a T@@ ama@@ got@@ chi@@ -@@ style game , in a dashboard designed to make you a more ecological driver .
corporations have also become aware of the trend of gamification and the effect of games on people like Generation G .
not just are the kids are going to be alright ; frankly , the kids are going to be awesome .
I think it &apos;s actually a serious problem .
they have the second-largest vehicle fleet on the road .
65 million compact fluorescent light bulbs were sold last year .
and you know what ? most consumers who have them don &apos;t even know it .
now , you wouldn &apos;t want that falling on your foot or your head , because it would do that to it .
well , let me ask you : what happens if you &apos;re standing in the road and a car &apos;s headed for you ?
he created this image for this .
if we see an asteroid that &apos;s going to hit the Earth and we have enough time , we can hit it to move it into a better orbit .

now at the time that I was reading this , it was the middle of the winter and I definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt in my New York City apartment .
what we &apos;re doing is what NASA or a large corporation would call R &amp; amp ; D , or research and development .
but I think that Ele@@ en expresses best what we really get out of this , which is the actual joy of collaboration .
over the course of two and a half months I lost my sp@@ leen , my kidneys , the hearing in my left ear and both of my legs below the knee .
and how was I going to snow@@ board again ?
&quot; could be I &apos;m wrong . I &apos;m tired of being wrong .
Thank you .
we just want it to vanish .
and the problem is that there are certain things that happen in life that we desperately want to change and we cannot .
and the third is commitment .
and even 20 years later , there was only 10 lawyers in the country , so consequently you &apos;d walk into a prison and not only would you meet 12-year-old boys , you &apos;d meet women and you &apos;d say , &quot; Why are you here ? &quot; women would say , &quot; Well I &apos;ve been here for 10 years because my husband committed a crime , but they can &apos;t find him . &quot;

in fact , most implant users really struggle and dislike music because it sounds so bad .
now the other issue comes with , not just the ability to tell pitches apart , but the ability to tell sounds apart .
and the second one .
what that suggests is that , even in the case of hearing loss , the capacity for music remains .
now , Susan Son@@ tag reminds us that photographs , in part , help define what we have the right to observe , but more importantly , they are an ethics of seeing .
should they get paid ?
I usually just got cut off .
and this goes directly against my very obsessive nature to try to find the right answer and the perfect words and the right form .
there are parts of me I only recognize from photographs .
the lo@@ ft on Wo@@ oster Street with the crea@@ ky hallways , the twel@@ ve-@@ foot ceilings , white walls and cold floors .
it helped a local , L@@ ech Wal@@ esa , to kick out one million Soviet troops from Poland , and in beginning the end of the Soviet Union as we know it .
they will say : &quot; people power will work only if there is a foreign pressure . &quot;
so , we pick tactics accommodated to the event , especially this thing we call the small tactics of disper@@ sion .
that thing is called a CAPTCHA .
Facebook : every time you add a friend or poke somebody , you help to digitize a book .
the problem with that is it &apos;s not yet good enough and it probably won &apos;t be for the next 15 to 20 years .
normally , you have to pay people to do this .
spiders are truly global citizens .
in an or@@ b-@@ web-@@ weaving spider , you can find seven types of silk glands , and what I have depicted here in this picture , let &apos;s start at the one o &apos;clock position , there &apos;s tubu@@ li@@ form silk glands , which are used to make the outer silk of an egg sac .
so if the web was made entirely out of dragline silk , an insect is very likely to just bounce right off . but by having really , really stret@@ chy capture spiral silk , the web is actually able to absorb the impact of that intercepted prey .
that &apos;s what the spider has to interact with their environment .
so the first soni@@ cation is at lower energy .
and in 2010 , she became a first-@@ time mother to a healthy baby .
you really are alive right here in this moment .
so it &apos;s hard to even describe what a funny note would be .
Thank you .
and it just depends on how big your model is .
maybe you have 100 slices , 1,000 or 10,000 slices .
I approach each project with a new insecurity , almost like the first project I ever did , and I get the swe@@ ats , I go in and start working , I &apos;m not sure where I &apos;m going -- if I knew where I was going , I wouldn &apos;t do it .
I just feel uncomfortable talking about or building anything on Ground Zero I think for a long time .
I mean , Charlie Moore did a bunch of it , but it didn &apos;t feel good to me .
FG : no , it &apos;s near the current campus .
RSW : I found the most remarkable thing .
just before going to lunch with the mayor , we went to the harbor commissioner .
it would be terrible .
like , even when you &apos;re having a good time , when is the good time over ?
he feels the way they are harvesting y@@ aks nowadays .
ninety-@@ five percent of every single car that goes on the road gets recycled here .

we heard over the last couple days what an urgent problem cancer still is in our society , what a pressing need it is for us to not have one person die every minute .
so imagine that you make a solution full of this sticky material and inject it into the veins of someone who has cancer , everything &apos;s going to get lit up .
so even if the tumor is not right on the surface , you &apos;ll still be able to see it .
it doesn &apos;t tell you whether or not the gas station has gas .
that takes time .
( Applause )
and there are ways that we can address this type of agriculture by using less fertilizer , maybe precision ferti@@ lizing .
but I truly believe that , as a scientist , using mostly federal funds to do the research , I owe it to the public , to agency heads and congressional people to share my knowledge with them so they can use it , hopefully to make better decisions about our environmental policy .
we can do better than this .
we all want a clean environment .
and that brings me to another aspect of this , which is , to whom should this get paid ?
if you look at the lens of public wealth as against the lens of private profits , you get a completely different answer , which is clearly conservation makes more sense , and not destruction .
when we measure GDP as a measure of economic performance at the national level , we don &apos;t include our biggest asset at the country level .
we &apos;ve done this for a very difficult case , which was for deforestation in China .
a decade and a half ago , I moved from working in law and technology in New York to financing , producing and distributing films in Nairobi , Lagos and Johannesburg .
well , aside from Mac@@ ron &apos;s . he &apos;s just wrong .
for musicians like P-@@ Square , Bon@@ go M@@ aff@@ in and Wiz@@ kid , mobile phones paved the path to local dominance and global star@@ dom .
what matters is that Africans are vali@@ dating African art and ideas , both critically and commercially , that they are watching what they want , and that African filmmakers are connecting with their core audiences .
films can serve as a conveyor belt for hope .
some things worked , some things didn &apos;t .
and I needed that wisdom at that moment in my life .
I tried to make these videos as engaging as possible .
now , Ms. Coun@@ ts and all of her librarian colleagues have really been at the forefront of comics advocacy , really since the early &apos; 80s , when a school library journal article stated that the mere presence of graphic novels in the library increased usage by about 80 percent and increased the circulation of non@@ comics material by about 30 percent .
but trust me -- we have very , very little in common .
it &apos;s not long after you plant a garden that you start to say , &quot; Hey , I need to start to learn how to cook . &quot;
( Applause ) Now , that &apos;s a funny little clip , but it &apos;d be even funnier if it weren &apos;t so tragic and if it weren &apos;t so true .
I &apos;m talking about the amount of time we all have in order to put a decent meal on the table .
we &apos;re already using the tax code to encourage green transport and green shelter .
medicines are very cheap to produce and they &apos;re very effective -- much more pleasant , actually , than the alternatives : hospitalization , operations , emergency rooms , the mor@@ gue ...
but there &apos;s also wasteful marketing .
a lot of the drugs there , often more than fifty percent of what &apos;s sold , are counterfeit drugs , where people say , &quot; Because the drug is so expensive , I can offer you a cheaper version . &quot;
also , pharmaceutical companies stand in fierce competition with one another , and if you do more , if you are nicer than the other company , sooner or later , you &apos;ll be driven out of the market .
who , then , should solve the problem ?
and with each particular medicine , they have their choice .
remember that the total money that the world spends on pharmaceuticals is a trillion .
in other cases , the new product is better than the old products , and so a person gets switched over to a better product , and we pay for the impact , for the difference the new product makes .
and it also benefits governments or taxpayers , if you like , because it creates a permanent source of pharmaceutical innovation that will be here for all future times .
we would have no access to love or to the ability to create .
and picture , if you will , a billboard , a digital billboard , where you have elements that can be either lit or not .
very odd -- I &apos;ve analyzed this for a while .
and the great beauty is that you can then go from memory , out of those association cor@@ tices , and produce back images in the very same regions that have perception .
the things that have to do with what is known as our internal mili@@ eu -- for example , the whole management of the chemistries within our body are , in fact , extremely maintained day after day for one very good reason .
second , understanding society and culture .
here are three sets of firing patterns . the top one is from a normal animal , the middle one is from a blind animal that &apos;s been treated with this enco@@ der-@@ transducer device , and the bottom one is from a blind animal treated with a standard prosthetic .
so you can see that it &apos;s pretty limited , and because the firing patterns aren &apos;t in the right code , they &apos;re very limited in what they can tell you about what &apos;s out there . so you can see that there &apos;s something there , but it &apos;s not so clear what that something is , and this just sort of circles back to what I was saying in the beginning , that with the standard method , patients can see high-@@ contrast edges , they can see light , but it doesn &apos;t easily go further than that . so what was the image ? it was a baby &apos;s face .
hil@@ arity ensu@@ es .
sometimes a good person would find it , sometimes a bad person would find it .
so in effect , you are like Odysseus and the first mate in one person .
at the same time , the Re@@ ti@@ rement R@@ isk Index , the chance of not being able to meet your needs in retirement , has been increasing .
anyway , you know every time I make this speech -- it &apos;s not the first time -- but it &apos;s an emotion .
very sad , dark .
it was the easiest way .
and then he added something I will never forget for the rest of my life .
everybody benefits from that -- those employed , of course , because they get a job and dignity .
and then I asked the usual question : &quot; is it a priority ?
it was really a fascinating journey .
but if you think about this , this is actually -- the &quot; Fre@@ ak@@ onom@@ ics &quot; authors wrote about this -- that more people die on a per mile basis from drunk walking than from drunk driving .
so they think it &apos;s actually very deadly .
what is the appropriate new metaphor for aging ?
as I slowly lost my speech , I gained my voice .
it &apos;s reflecting on the experiences that we &apos;ve had that makes us wise and that helps us become whole , brings wisdom and authenticity .
( Laughter ) We have agency .
if we can go back and redefine ourselves and become whole , this will create a cultural shift in the world , and it will give an example to younger generations so that they can re@@ conceive their own lifespan .
and if you look , you can see them happening , already beginning to emerge .
and that &apos;s the world we &apos;re coming into , in which we will increasingly see that our alliances are not fixed .
can@@ ning , the great British foreign secretary once said , &quot; Britain has a common interest , but no common allies . &quot;
at that time , the defense of my country was about one thing and one thing only : how strong was our army , how strong was our air force , how strong was our navy and how strong were our allies .
it &apos;s your capacity to network that matters , both within your governments and extern@@ ally .
because if you think about it , 1,000 TED Talks , that &apos;s over 1,000 ideas worth spreading .
so I was almost ready to give up when one night , I played around with these sentences and found out that there &apos;s actually a beautiful solution in here .
when you strip away detail , you tend to tell stories in terms of good versus evil , whether it &apos;s a story about your own life or a story about politics .
so if you &apos;re too attached to stories , what will happen is people selling products come along , and they will bundle their product with a story .
( Laughter ) Sometimes , the most intellectually trustworthy people are the ones who pick one area , and they are totally dog@@ matic in that , so pi@@ g-@@ he@@ ade@@ dly unreasonable , that you think , &quot; How can they possibly believe that ? &quot;
so don &apos;t fall into the trap of thinking because you &apos;re agnostic on some things , that you &apos;re being fundamentally reasonable about your self-@@ deception , your stories , and your open-@@ mindedness .
now you might wonder how a 13 year-old girl could come up with this idea .
my parents suffered through many more of my science fair projects , including a remote controlled garbage can .
so we ran all of these tests blocking the protein , and we saw this huge shift .
and ever since then , I &apos;ve gotten to do some pretty cool stuff -- from getting to meet the president to getting to be on this stage to talk to all of you guys .
for example , volatile organic compounds are chemical pollutants that are found in our schools , homes and workplaces .
but before I end my talk today , I want to leave you with one saying .
and that saying is that genetics loads the gun , but the environment pulls the trigger .
and we have among states a reluctance in dealing with them .
so he engaged a political process of dialogue , not as a strategy of the weak , but as a strategy of the strong .
I was wondering if my partner and I would ever have an opportunity to start a family .
that it would be my job that would give me routine and stability when I was dealing with so many difficult personal decisions and so much uncertainty .
and there are several reasons for this .
chemo brain presents itself through memory loss , an inability to concentrate and an inability to solve problems .
and trust me , these were people that were not afraid of setting a good deadline .
( Laughter ) I got the impression they didn &apos;t want to put any extra pressure on me while I was going through treatment .
one strand can be copied directly , and you can see these things spo@@ ol@@ ing off to the bottom there .
( Laughter ) This was work from a number of years ago@@ -- Thank you .
it broad@@ casts through chemical signals , telling the rest of the cell when it &apos;s ready , when it feels that everything is aligned and ready to go for the separation of the chromosomes .
the reactors we have today use uranium oxide as a fuel .
a liquid fluoride thorium reactor would be a compact facility , very energy-efficient and safe , that would produce the energy we need day and night , and without respect to weather conditions .
it &apos;s almost as though either you accept the doctrine and then you can have all the nice stuff , or you reject the doctrine and you &apos;re living in some kind of spiritual wa@@ st@@ eland under the guidance of CNN and Walmart .
so that &apos;s a sort of tough choice .
I &apos;m an independent , individual person . &quot;
what is a calendar ?
we should all look at the Moon a bit more often . we don &apos;t .
now art is something that in the secular world , we think very highly of . we think art is really , really important .
art is about two things in all the major faiths .
R@@ emb@@ ran@@ dt is a propag@@ an@@ dist in the Christian view .
the universe is large and we are tiny , without the need for further religious super@@ structure .
this is Stephen Wat@@ t .
privacy is implied .
and the back story is this : SOPA and PIPA , as legislation , were drafted largely by media companies that were founded in the 20th century .
that is a side effect of their ordinary operation .
these industries will not be content with breaking our Internet .
because that &apos;s the real message of PIPA and SOPA .
and he pointed to the bus@@ loads of tourists that would show up everyday , with cameras ready usually .
now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would recommend for people when you &apos;re considering their future financial well-being .
all of these techniques that I &apos;m describing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices -- better for you , you can use them on yourself , better for the people that you are serving .
nobody had ever thought about a repetition , a pattern-@@ free structure before .
and I have to say now , I &apos;ll say it a bit later , but I &apos;m not challenging this just because I &apos;m weird , the challenge actually has a very , very long and distinguished history .
now those parts are also physical parts , of course , brains , bodies and legs and things , but they aren &apos;t so important , actually .
because if you think that you have this fixed , permanent essence , which is always the same , throughout your life , no matter what , in a sense you &apos;re kind of trapped .
because unlike the the water@@ falls , we actually have the capacity to channel the direction of our development for ourselves to a certain degree .
so we have to look at what I call the &quot; bottom down economy . &quot;
so in some cases , we can abolish totally the need for manual labor .
using this process , pioneers in the industry are layering up cells today .
it was deep in my imagination .
( Laughter ) And it &apos;s odd , isn &apos;t it ?
I wouldn &apos;t mind if every one of you came up on this stage tonight and told us how you &apos;ve gotten over the big disap@@ pointments of your lives .
and with all sincerity , I can say , I am glad I lived those two years of my life that way , because my goal to not suffer regrets anymore , I got there with that goal .
Hey , why not ?
in high school , a classmate once said that Brian Goldman would study for a blood test .
&quot; well she &apos;s back , &quot; in just that tone of voice .
I began to feel a bit better .
today we &apos;re often too busy tending to our iPhones and iPods to really stop and get to know ourselves .
we created the responsive room where the lights , music and blinds adjusted to your state .
here &apos;s an application that I created for the iPad .
business , she said , was critical to her country &apos;s future .
think about this : here were girls who bra@@ ved danger to become bread@@ winners during years in which they couldn &apos;t even be on their streets .
theory and empirical evidence Have already taught us .
my mom was a single mom who worked at the phone company during the day and sold T@@ upper@@ ware at night so that I could have every opportunity possible .
Thank you very much .
so we said , there &apos;s just got to be a better way to do this .
but interestingly enough , this actually relates to the idea in that these guys were creating some incredibly powerful , impressive digital art , all without computers , I &apos;m told , it was all peer-to-peer coordination and communication .
so what you see here potentially the week leading up to Valentine &apos;s Day .
he fired again .
he could have done something .
it removes the incentive for an arms race between potentially hostile groups in our societies .
now nonviolence starts to work like a fly@@ wheel .
my soldiers use the gun as an instrument of peace .
importantly , those special proteins are among the most highly charged objects in our body .
but so in here when there &apos;s electricity , the oxygen concentr@@ ator takes in room air .
so in other words , what we have here is a machine that can enable surgery and save lives , because it was designed for its environment , just like the first machine I showed you .
they have a really cool anesthesia simulation lab out in Baltimore .
the amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed steady since it evolved two and a half billion years ago .
( Laughter ) So what was the next step ?
but we &apos;re taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , sequences of sounds , and producing something very complicated in your brain .
so now we &apos;ve spe@@ eded up the time scales once again .
and try that again and do that for another generation .
what &apos;s more , I was dou@@ bly surprised at how vulnerable this made me feel .
but it doesn &apos;t mean that these interactions aren &apos;t uncomfortable .
no matter how much I believed in gender neutrality in theory , in practice , the absence of femininity is not neutrality , it &apos;s masculinity .
now , he was a German drama@@ tist ...
because the greatest communicators -- I went through speeches , everything -- I can overlay the shape .
this would be like the in@@ citing incident in a movie .
so you &apos;ll encounter resistance .
he leaves them with the promise that Apple will continue to build revolutionary new products .
ending -- painting a picture of this new bliss , using the very things inside of them that they already held as sacred .
how should a group of people , who perhaps live in a city or in the continent or even the whole globe , share and manage common resources ?
let &apos;s explore that asser@@ tion , though .
the first question is : who thinks living in a democracy is a good thing ?
they would become more than the sum of their parts .
the question is not : would this be perfect ?
we can hold policy juries and citizens &apos; assemb@@ lies , like the new@@ Demo@@ cracy Foundation is doing in Australia , like the Jefferson Center is doing in the US and like the Irish government is doing right now .
it allows us to connect to the world .
so let &apos;s use this energy to make the world a better place .
I &apos;m going to go out on a limb here and say that if Queensland police didn &apos;t have OC spray , they wouldn &apos;t have shot 2,@@ 2@@ 26 people in those two years .
but they &apos;re never used like that .
and yes , Qatar wants to be a modern nation .
yet , within 70 days , all 33 of these men will be brought to the surface alive .
and they were willing to take risks to learn fast what might work .
they came from volunteers around the world .
and then on the 6@@ 9th day , over 22 painsta@@ king hours , they managed to pull the miners out one by one .
when teaming works , you can be sure that some leaders , leaders at all levels , have been crystal clear that they don &apos;t have the answers .
you need psychological safety to do that .
let me say this very clearly : it &apos;s not honor ; it &apos;s a cold-@@ blooded murder .
and so we will evaluate them .
and this is a skull that is two meters long .
so one of my graduate students , John S@@ cann@@ ella , looked through our whole collection and he actually discovered that the hole starting to form in Triceratops and , of course it &apos;s open , in Tor@@ osaurus -- so he found the transitional ones between Triceratops and Tor@@ osaurus , which was pretty cool .
living life like a computer -- stereot@@ y@@ pically deterministic , exhaustive and exact -- doesn &apos;t sound like a lot of fun .
sometimes the problems we have to solve are simply very , very hard .
so to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
and despite that , it retains a level of realism .
I learned that they serve in non-@@ combat roles .
for the average work , it &apos;s not necessary to have an interpreter by your side .
I also found out online about another soldier , who is deaf in one ear .
I was impressed by that .
it was remarkable .
she gets six feet away , turns around , smiles and goes , &quot; You should probably know this , too : I &apos;m still dating that guy , four years later . &quot;
now it &apos;s very easy actually to get a chemical compound from products into the human body through the skin .
one is that you and I all have between 30 to 50,000 chemicals in our bodies that our grandparents didn &apos;t have .
so for example , in the United Kingdom , the incidence of childhood leukemia has risen by 20 percent just in a generation .
in fact , my involvement in the whole pesticide issue was sort of a surprise as well when I was approached by the largest chemical company in the world and they asked me if I would evaluate how atrazine affected amphibians , or my frogs .
it turns out , atrazine is the largest selling product for the largest chemical company in the world .
and I have to take a little bit of artistic license .
it shouldn &apos;t come to any surprise that the things that happen in wildlife are also a warning to us , just like Rachel Carson and others have warned .
we turn on the faucet , the water comes out , we assume it &apos;s safe , and we assume that we are masters of our environment , rather than being part of it .
it turns out , merely watching a romantic comedy causes relationship satisfaction to plum@@ met .
so we have to keep an eye on that .
now pit percussion was fun .
nobody mentioned it to me , nobody complained .
( Applause )
and this is the point where patients get into position and can collect , not only their own control again , be captain of their own ship , but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face , like health-care cost explosion , doubled demand and things like that , make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in the team .
so what we did , we crowd@@ sourced the Netherlands .
( Laughter ) Women had been brainwashed and led on for so long until we had fallen victim and actually started believing in this ourselves .
my roots shaped me and my culture is here to stay with me .
it was a well-documented fishery .
before 2006 , we had no idea of the genetic variability of basking sharks .
the catalyst for this change was the major earthquake that struck Haiti on the 12th of January in 2010 .
it was about two meters high , completely squ@@ ashed by the violence of the earthquake .
it &apos;s used for public health awareness campaigns such as the prevention of cholera .
and they are giving a voice to themselves .
and you know , that &apos;s just simply not true .
I have no idea where I was , except I know what state .
now , that &apos;s great if you &apos;re lighting the indoors , but in its application in outdoor lighting , that traditional shape of the light bulb , the sort of globe that spreads light everywhere , is actually very inefficient .
it &apos;s missing that savage beauty of experiencing that very thing in the wild for yourself , un@@ mediated by a screen .
and , not surprisingly , they tell you that all this was done by Mar@@ duk .
it becomes critical to find a symbol that will pull together all Iranians -- Muslims and non-@@ Muslims , Christians , Z@@ oro@@ a@@ stri@@ ans , Jews living in Iran , people who are devout , not devout .
this is the exact opposite of the way that anger and fear and panic , all of the f@@ light-@@ or-@@ fight responses , operate .
so we tossed it back and forth until Joel came up with this .
so my suggestion to those of you out here who are seriously focused on creating a better world is to take a little bit of time each day and practice thinking funny , because you might just find the question that you &apos;ve been looking for .
what are we going to do about it ?
twelve percent do .
maybe we should make people save more when they make more money .
we settled in Fo@@ ot@@ sc@@ ray , a working-class suburb whose demographic is layers of immigrants .
and there were rare but sear@@ ing chan@@ ts of &quot; slit@@ -@@ eye &quot; and the occasional graffiti : &quot; Asian , go home . &quot;
she opened a computer store , then studied to be a beau@@ tician and opened another business .
I told my mother I couldn &apos;t do it .
scientists call this &quot; de@@ identification . &quot;
sometimes parents contaminate the de@@ identification process , communicating to their kids subtly or not , that only certain kinds of accomplishments will be applauded in the home .
( Laughter ) Bir@@ th order , another topic I covered for T@@ IM@@ E , and another topic I cover in the book , plays out in other ways as well .
all of this explains why first@@ borns are like@@ lier to be CEOs , they are like@@ lier to be senators , they are like@@ lier to be astronauts , and they are like@@ lier to earn more than other kids are .
I think of us as the fly@@ over states .
we process that phenomenon through the same lobe in our brain that processes disgust , meaning we react to the idea of somebody being cheated the same way we react to pu@@ tre@@ fied meat .
this is a defibrill@@ ator , and this is a device that goes into a person to control their heart rhythm , and these have saved many lives .
all of these were implemented successfully .
could you run a deni@@ al-@@ of-@@ service , because these are first responders ?
and so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it .
what scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it ?
they would be received by a second ship , and that would give us very precise estimates , in this case , of 250 billion herring in a period of about a minute .
we can also use satellite tags to track animals as they move through the oceans .
so even after a 10-year census , there are large areas that still remain unexplored .
they had been pushed genetically .
they were not eaten , they were thrown away because they were dead .
and over time it changes -- it changes because people do things , or naturally .
because with marine protected areas , we actually recreate the past .
let me begin with four words that will provide the context for this week , four words that will come to define this century .
in other words , thanks to those pesky laws of physics , when things aren &apos;t sustainable , they stop .
number one , how smooth it is -- through good time and bad time , war time and peace time , recession , depression and boom time .
today we can point at dozens of companies that have done just that .
you see , aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , worth more than gold and platinum .
but then the technology of electro@@ ly@@ sis came along and literally made aluminum so cheap that we use it with thro@@ w-@@ away mentality .
ladies and gentlemen , we are on a planet that is bathed with 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year .
and we &apos;ve seen this in cellphones .
what about giving the oppressed , wherever they might be , the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever ?
and this game has been played by university professors and so forth .
and it uses these sensors to build a map of the environment .
not all the time -- these things aren &apos;t absolute -- but a lot of the time .
it &apos;s great for introverts and it &apos;s great for extroverts .
N@@ ate came next to me .
we kept sending food to those places that really were in need .
JA : there are . so what &apos;s next is we slowly began going down after , more or less , FEMA let us know that they thought they had everything under control and we were no longer needed , but you only believe everything so much .
San Lorenz@@ o was critical , because the bridge was broken , and so it was an island inside the island , a little community surrounded by water .
and the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
the other way of thinking about it is not , do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit , but do we deserve to kill ?
and these older people come up to me now and they say , &quot; Mr. Stevenson , you give talks , you make speeches , you tell people to stop saying we &apos;re dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation &apos;s history after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart .
we &apos;re trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice .
we &apos;re trying to end mass incarceration . &quot;
and I was up too late one night and I starting thinking , well gosh , if the judge can turn you into something that you &apos;re not , the judge must have magic power .
I &apos;ve come to TED because I believe that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is long , but it bends toward justice .
Thank you very much .
and so if I were going to give you the ending of this story , it would go something like this : and that &apos;s what ultimately led me to speaking to you here at TED about story .
it &apos;s not just that they &apos;re damn cute ; it &apos;s because they can &apos;t completely express what they &apos;re thinking and what their intentions are .
and some of us are born with temper@@ aments that are positive , some are negative .
but more importantly , have you made me want to know how it will all conclude in the long-term ?
and it wasn &apos;t until , on one of my later vie@@ wings , that the veil was lifted and it was in a scene where he &apos;s walked across the Sin@@ ai Desert and he &apos;s reached the Su@@ ez Canal , and I suddenly got it .
the total energy imbalance now is about six-@@ tenths of a watt per square meter .
that &apos;s how much extra energy Earth is gaining each day .
in recent years , because of global warming , they now cover about 10 percent -- an increase by a factor of 25 to 50 .
sounds like a conservative climate plan . &quot;
the science is clear .
we have to engage with the machinery of government .
it &apos;s a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed 3@@ 25-@@ page report that &apos;s a response to the SE@@ C &apos;s request for comment on the Financial Re@@ form Bill .
WG : to be racially literate -- PV : to understand who we are so that we can heal together -- WG : we cannot neglect the heart -- PV : or the mind .
this is a dumb game , but it under@@ scores a belief I have , that the world is full of order that doesn &apos;t necessarily deserve our respect .
I had this black-and-white character printed on it , so that way , when the disc is turned , it comple@@ tes the couple in all of these different gu@@ ises .
so today , I want to put forth this idea that an avenue to better is through a million teeny , tiny disruptions to whatever is sitting in front of you .
I was constantly being teased by everybody , especially my two older siblings .
in order for us to stop the violence that goes on in the world , I hope -- at least I beg you -- to pause .
( Laughter ) Canadian group , undoubtedly .
I &apos;m not quite sure why you decide not to do it .
you &apos;re going to fail , because -- because you &apos;re not going to do it , because you will have invented a new excuse , any excuse to fail to take action , and this excuse , I &apos;ve heard so many times : &quot; yes , I would pursue a great career , but , I value human relationships -- ( Laughter ) more than accomplishment .
( audience reacts and gasps ) GG : so what &apos;s happening ?
( Beatboxing ) This is the first time this has ever happened in the history of mankind .
but then , why am I conscious ? what is consciousness ?
perhaps intelligent civilizations come to realize that life is ultimately just complex patterns of information interacting with each other in a beautiful way , and that that can happen more efficiently at a small scale .
well , okay , that &apos;s a crazy thought .
that &apos;s the Pacific .
you know things like corals ; you &apos;ve seen plenty of corals , those of you who &apos;ve been to the beach , snor@@ k@@ eling , know corals are an amazing place to go -- full of life , some big animals , small animals , some nice , some dangerous , sharks , whales , all that stuff .
now we were sure -- because this is poisonous water , because it &apos;s so deep it would crush the Titanic the same way you crush an empty cup in your hand -- we were sure there would be no life there at all .
all those are controlled in some way by the ocean , and this is a thing that we haven &apos;t even explored -- five percent .
women say something like , &quot; Fant@@ astic . it &apos;s about time . when ? &quot;
so why does the world need a male pill ?
what happens when you look at what the discover@@ ers were thinking about when they made their discoveries , is you understand that they are not so different from us .
in 1902 , the great American psychologist William James wrote about the many varieties of religious experience .
when we climb that staircase , self-interest fades away , we become just much less self-@@ interested , and we feel as though we are better , no@@ bler and somehow up@@ lifted .
and sometimes it would be advantageous for one of these guys to try to sabotage the other guys .
I can &apos;t be certain if the staircase is an adaptation rather than a bug , but if it is an adaptation , then the implications are profound .
when you think about it , we &apos;re so constrained by browsing the Web , remembering U@@ R@@ Ls , saving favorites .
well , we collect data from satellites , from airplanes , from ground vehicles , from people .
and I think some disp@@ as@@ sionate , quantitative reasoning could really bring a great deal to the debate .
for instance , just recently the Motion Picture Association revealed that our economy loses 58 billion dollars a year to copyright theft .
and I said , &quot; Let me ask you something . &quot;

I &apos;ve failed miserably , many times .
I can bring home the bacon , fry it up in the pan and never let you forget you &apos;re a man . &quot;

what we don &apos;t see is the sculpture or the beauty or the individual qualities or the uniqueness or the elegance to them .

the fun thing with John &apos;s leg is that when his fi@@ ance@@ e looked at this , she joked and said , &quot; I like that leg better than that leg . &quot;

because I think you can leave here if you do these three steps and a couple of little tricks , as I said , I &apos;m going to tell you , and you can begin to change the world the way you want to .
and I hit the puddle , and -- ff@@ f@@ tt ! -- all the water underneath my car , and instantly , I have an aha moment .
from the disc@@ our@@ ses that are going on within architecture as well as throughout society , I think it is time to change the way that we look at things .
it &apos;s much more than an aesthetic or just a sensory experience .
it was a gesture , it was a single design that addressed the needs and the requirements of those establishing cities and new colonies .
it &apos;s a polarizing and negative force .
we see it in this city , and we &apos;re seeing it more and more other cities .
and there are lots of ways we can do that , ways in which we can address and look at how we break down those barriers .
and we &apos;re doing it with four percent of the population .
somehow that doesn &apos;t seem right .
does that continue ?
it &apos;s 25 percent cleaner than oil .
it &apos;s going to be very simple for us to use .
we found out that we could go to the source rock , which were the carb@@ oni@@ fer@@ ous sh@@ ales in the bas@@ ins .
if someone comes to you with a plan that really looks like it might be part of this solution , are you ready to invest in those technologies , even if they aren &apos;t maxi@@ mized for profits , they might be maxi@@ mized for the future health of the planet ?
and in fact , it probably won &apos;t .
Oh , by the way , I make yellow@@ cake in my garage , so my nuclear program is as advanced as the Iranians .
so maybe I don &apos;t want to admit to that .

and she looked at me and said , &quot; No , of course not ! &quot;
how we die lives on in the minds of everybody who survives us , and the stress created in families by dying is enormous , and in fact you get seven times as much stress by dying in intensive care as by dying just about anywhere else , so dying in intensive care is not your top option if you &apos;ve got a choice .
and this one &apos;s the biggest growth industry of all , and at least six out of 10 of the people in this room will die in this form , which is the dwindling of capacity with increasing fra@@ ilty , and fra@@ ilty &apos;s an inevitable part of aging , and increasing fra@@ ilty is in fact the main thing that people die of now , and the last few years , or the last year of your life is spent with a great deal of disability , unfortunately .
and since we know where their heads are , and we have a wireless mic on them that we &apos;re processing the sound from , we &apos;re able to create visualizations which are linked very tightly to what they &apos;re doing with their speech .

we hate this mortar , to stand hours and hours .
and this woman is very happy now , bringing her products to the market .
this would just be sitting somewhere , and we would have never been able to see that .
so this memorial , I think , has an incredibly timely concept in our era of social networks , because these networks -- these real-life networks that make up people &apos;s lives -- are actually embodied inside of the memorial .
by understanding that , the dialo@@ g becomes a lot different .
it &apos;s fitted with solid electrodes and an electro@@ ly@@ te that &apos;s a solution of salt and water .

in that moment and still today when I doubt , when I feel afraid , when I need to reconnect with that feeling , I remember his words , they were so powerful .
dirt poor , no money , living with my parents , I again said , &quot; No . &quot;
eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab , I started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .

let &apos;s talk about how we can use digital technology , the technology of our dreams , to make this life the life we can love .
number one , it &apos;s the name of my rock band , and second , is because the confrontation of these things forced me to become an inventor .
and you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally underwater and to depths of 200 meters straight down underwater .
BS : what Jim didn &apos;t know when he released that movie was that six months earlier NASA had funded a team I assembled to develop a prototype for the Europa A@@ UV .
we calculate gradient surfaces , and drive the bot over to a wall where there &apos;s a high probability of life .
the real hat trick for this vehicle , though , is a disruptive new navigation system we &apos;ve developed , known as 3D S@@ L@@ AM , for simultaneous local@@ ization and mapping .

these were the low-tech approaches to the high-tech conversations I was having .

one is reciprocity , and associated with it is a sense of justice and a sense of fairness .
one kind of token feeds only the partner who chooses , the other one feeds both of them .
( Laughter ) So this is basically the Wall Street protest that you see here .
now , as a world , there are lots of things we have to do in the global health community if we want to make the world better in the future -- things like fight diseases .
but what &apos;s not universal is our ability to provide every good thing .
the surprising thing to me , as I learned this history , was that it spread not along socioeconomic lines but around cultural lines .
it took so long back then because the contraceptives weren &apos;t that good .

today , with diabetes , what do we do ?
I would pose to you that tomorrow -- and when tomorrow is we could debate , but it &apos;s within the foreseeable future -- we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation .
here &apos;s just one example before I close up .
and I tell you what , it like everybody &apos;s got a story .
in the last few years we realized we were in the deepest crisis of medicine &apos;s existence due to something you don &apos;t normally think about when you &apos;re a doctor concerned with how you do good for people , which is the cost of health care .
autonomy was our highest value .
well , we &apos;ve now discovered 4,000 medical and surgical procedures .
there &apos;s another sign that we need pit crews , and that &apos;s the un@@ manageable cost of our care .
and so he asked the question , &quot; How many did we do ? &quot;
they had found a problem .
and it &apos;s been slow to spread .
no counter offer .
there are several instances in U@@ ttar Pradesh of people dying before their case is given a proper review .

children have to leave the orphanage at age 16 , despite the fact that there &apos;s often nowhere for them to go .
and it reads : &quot; those who do not know their past are not worthy of their future . &quot;
and stress , worry , anger all decrease with age .
and every time we p@@ aged them , we &apos;d ask them to answer several questions -- &quot; On a one to seven scale , how happy are you right now ? &quot;
if we show older , middle-aged , younger people images , like the ones you see on the screen , and we later ask them to recall all the images that they can , older people , but not younger people , remember more positive images than negative images .
maybe our neural centers in our brain are degraded such that we &apos;re unable to process negative emotions anymore .
all of these diseases have a strong evolutionary component that directly relates to the fact that we live today in a very different environment than the ones in which our bodies evolved .
now the idea of a multiverse is a strange one .
the challenge is we don &apos;t know the shape of the extra dimensions .
because those universes that have much more dark energy than ours , whenever matter tries to clump into galaxies , the repulsive push of the dark energy is so strong that it blows the clump apart and galaxies don &apos;t form .
we now know that there are many planets at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars .
you see , when we speak of the Big Bang , we often have an image of a kind of cosmic explosion that created our universe and set space rushing outward .
so instead of being antisocial with your money , what if you were more pro-social with it ?
people gave money to homeless people .
but the point we want to make here tonight is , favelas are not always a problem .
all these red parts are favelas .
I &apos;m going to give a fast example here .
this was an old building in a favela in Rio -- &#91; unclear favela name &#93; -- that we just transformed into a primary school , with high quality .
so this means that in a place with a lot of AIDS , there &apos;s a really significant cost of sex .
but this leaves us with a big gap in our knowledge .
so I can tell you what the prevalence was in Kenya in 2003 , but I can &apos;t tell you anything about 1993 or 1983 .
that &apos;s great .
( Laughter ) Audience : shake . fold .
JS : now , there &apos;s now a real fancy invention , it &apos;s the one where you wave your hand and it kicks it out .
but when we think about games , a lot of times we think about stuff like this : first-@@ person shoot@@ ers , or the big , what we would call AAA games , or maybe you &apos;re a Facebook game player .
so this is a game called &quot; S@@ í@@ och@@ án L@@ eat . &quot; it &apos;s &quot; peace be with you . &quot;
I &apos;m hoping that I &apos;ll teach culture through these games .
where would it go ?
( video ) So this is the big idea .
it &apos;s ho@@ i@@ sted .
general Eisenhower repu@@ tedly said that enlar@@ ging the boundaries of a tough problem makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more syner@@ gies .
oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day , plus another four billion dollars a day in hidden economic and military costs , raising its total cost to over a sixth of GDP .
lighter and more slippery autos need less force to move them , so their engines get smaller .
( Laughter ) In one minute -- and you can tell from the sound how immensely stiff and strong it is .
in other words , oil is getting un@@ competitive even at low prices before it becomes un@@ available even at high prices .
but now let &apos;s turn those compounding losses around backwards , and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe saves 10 units of fuel cost , pollution and what Hunter Lov@@ ins calls &quot; global weir@@ ding &quot; back at the power plant .
we &apos;re often told though that only coal and nuclear plants can keep the lights on , because they &apos;re 24 / 7 , whereas wind and solar power are variable , and hence supposedly unreliable .
usually I like working in my shop , but when it &apos;s raining and the driveway outside turns into a river , then I just love it .
you have no idea how much time I spend .
is there an actual inspiration behind each one ?
the very moment I turned it on , I hated it .
we are being watched .

one project that explores these ideas , which was made about a year ago , is a piece called We Feel Fine .
we see &quot; better &quot; is the most frequent feeling , followed by &quot; bad . &quot;
&quot; I wouldn &apos;t hide it if society didn &apos;t make me feel like I needed to . &quot;
and as an adult , I &apos;ve been more aware of the great Greek myths playing out in the sky overhead every night .
it &apos;s using the AP@@ I of a really great company that I work with in New York , actually , called D@@ ay@@ life .
any of those can be opened up .
you &apos;ll notice that in D@@ ay@@ life -- rather , in Universe -- it supports both the notion of a global mythology , which is represented by something as broad as , say , 2007 , and also a personal mythology .
how did this piece of 18th century Austrian aristo@@ cratic entertainment turn into the victory crow of this New York kid ?

that was the family business .
and I began to think , I wonder what it would be like to start imagining myself as if energy and information were the two things I had as input -- as if food and information were similar in some form or shape .
do you go to a restaurant ?
and by this time I was hooked .
so you start really understanding that you can have diseases , toxins , a need to balance your diet , and once you start looking , and from that point on , everything I have done in terms of the consumption of information , the production of information , the preparation of information , I &apos;ve looked at from the viewpoint of food .
you might think that it &apos;s quite hard to find new stories and new subjects , but new technology is changing the way we can film .
these mountains are dangerous places , but ultimately the fate of these bear families , and indeed that of all bears around the North Pacific , depends on the salmon .
they are ped@@ aling really hard , they &apos;re sweaty , they &apos;re bouncing around a lot .
over the last few millen@@ ia , we &apos;ve invented a series of technologies -- from the alphabet , to the scroll , to the co@@ dex , the printing press , photography , the computer , the smartphone -- that have made it progressively easier and easier for us to extern@@ alize our memories , for us to essentially outsource this fundamental human capacity .
same word , different amount of remembering ; that &apos;s weird .
I know that there &apos;s incredible stuff happening in these people &apos;s minds , but I don &apos;t have access to it .
it was a beautiful vision , and it &apos;s one I still believe in , and yet , haunting that beautiful vision was the dark side of how it could also turn out .
early digital culture , and indeed , digital culture to this day , had a sense of , I would say , lef@@ ty , socialist mission about it , that unlike other things that have been done , like the invention of books , everything on the internet must be purely public , must be available for free , because if even one person cannot afford it , then that would create this terrible inequity .
I think this is a matter of a globally tragic , ast@@ ound@@ ingly ridiculous mistake , rather than a wave of evil .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this turned into a contest .
and what they learned was that those little things , done right , actually matter , and that well-designed moments can build brands .
and the answer is smell , the smell of her body .
by 1800 , there are 30 .
and it can be printed and mass-@@ distributed , and I will be famous everywhere , and everybody else will play my music . &quot;
so now , maybe we can talk about these two guys .
that &apos;s a device that you can use if you have my piece of paper .
so the product becomes sheet music , becomes a piece of paper that you can then take home .
in the 21st century , it becomes a digital file .
with each of these disruptions , it changes the amount of social interaction .
the first one is getting along well with others .
how interesting are you ?
so they tend to expect the future to be worse than it ends up being .
and indeed they did -- but mostly when the information we gave them was better than what they expected .
after that everything goes back to normal , I assure you .
but what you may not know is that on any given night in America , almost half a million people go to sleep in those concrete jail cells who have not been convicted of anything .
so the king of England , Alfred the Great , will use a vocabulary and grammar that is quite different from the king of hip hop , J@@ ay-@@ Z .
but it doesn &apos;t sound so much , it &apos;s not relatively enough , it won &apos;t make a difference if you &apos;ve already committed 100,000 soldiers previously .
they cannot eliminate trachoma unless they get more .
and we can make significant progress in two countries which have the highest burden of the disease , which is Ethiopia and Nigeria .
it changes quickly as the water and animals move .
we need to get out ahead of fishing impacts and work to understand this critical part of the ocean .
satellite tracking devices on animals such as sharks are now showing us that many top predators regularly dive deep into the twilight zone to feed .
( Applause )
and that satellite will collect data about pollution that is warming the planet .
tweets started flying -- # cut@@ methane .
these people who went through the process and touched the snake ended up having less anxiety about other things in their lives .
he painted the walls and he painted the machine , and he got the operators re@@ trained by people who know kids , like children &apos;s museum people .
I study ants , and that &apos;s because I like to think about how organizations work .
then the nest maintenance workers work inside the nest , and I wanted to say that the nests look a lot like Bill Li@@ sh@@ man &apos;s house .
and what I wanted to know was , &quot; OK , here &apos;s a situation where extra nest maintenance workers were recruited -- is this going to have any effect on the workers performing other tasks ? &quot;
and what we &apos;re learning is that an ant uses the pattern of its anten@@ nal contacts , the rate at which it meets ants of other tasks , in deciding what to do .
and one of the things that we &apos;re studying is how natural selection might be acting now to shape this use of interaction patterns -- this network of interaction patterns -- to perhaps increase the foraging efficiency of ant colonies .
if I were to scoop up two gallons of seawater , there would be more bacteria in those two gallons than there are people on this planet .
so basically we had automobiles , but we were unaware of the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet .
and this is something we commonly do to look for respiratory viruses like influenza .
Islam is the majority religion all the way from the Atlantic Ocean across the Middle East , Southern Europe and through Asia all the way to Indonesia .
( Applause ) It &apos;s a quite amazing development which has happened .
you need to have access to some family planning .
I be@@ friend a young juggler in a juggling trou@@ pe , and he agrees to sell me three clubs .
nothing to do with golf .
these are rejects . they are completely out of alignment .
now I have all of those ropes parallel like this .
( Laughter ) In@@ tuition is a tool essential in my life .
on the other , the universe of the clouds , so full of unknown we think it &apos;s empty .
faith is what replaces doubt in my dictionary .
some years ago I was invited to open the Israel Festival by a high-@@ wire walk .
and in my hotel room , each time I practiced making it appear and throwing her in the air , she would graze the wall and end up on the bed .
because all those people were made up of people who , for the most part , considered each other enemies .
and something happened .
but for the first time in three decades into this epidemic we have a real chance to come to grips with HIV .
the U.S. and Malaysia came to harm reduction a little later , and they have higher rates of HIV in these populations .
to begin , countries need to review their legislation as it touches HIV and vulnerable groups .
okay , here we go .
so please , without further a@@ do .
here &apos;s the go-@@ k@@ art that we built together .
it was a warning about his exposure to the toxic chemicals .
we invited leading artists , engineers and philosophers to write essays about this , and the results are collected in this book from MIT Press .
( Laughter ) So he loved the concept , and when the Tele@@ -@@ Actor walked onstage , she walked right up to him , and she gave him a big kiss right on the lips .
and he was great , he just gave her a big hug in return , and it worked out great .
so he &apos;s gotten robots to fly helicopters , do incredibly interesting , beautiful ac@@ ro@@ ba@@ tics , by watching human experts fly them .
and we go through this several rounds .
one thing we noticed with &quot; The Si@@ ms , &quot; a game I did earlier , is that players love making stuff .
almost , again , like the Mont@@ ess@@ ori toy idea .
this world was actually extracted from the player &apos;s imagination .
I want them , after they &apos;ve played this game , to have extracted an entire world that they &apos;re now interacting with .
I can look over here , and this is a little simplified food web that &apos;s going on with the creatures .
they deliver about 5 watts per square meter of land area .
it &apos;s a way for the world to handle this issue .
one in six Americans will struggle with mental illness .
and Archimedes Co@@ dex C was just one of those seven .
so it took four years to take apart .
how were we going to do that ?
because the Web of the ancient manuscripts of the future isn &apos;t going to be built by institutions .
he apparently needed something that she was blocking , so he moved her .
her fury was ignited by lifetimes of men helping themselves to women &apos;s bodies without consent .
I &apos;m going to give it back to you as soon as I &apos;m done .
no , no , no , no , no .
Gs : so this was such an important moment for SpaceX .
we &apos;ve got a couple of launches of Falcon He@@ avy later this year , so this had to go right .
how was that possible ?
people worry a lot about this .
that &apos;s worth pointing out , by the way .
( Applause ) It &apos;s the fundamental risk reduction for the human species .
if an act of desperation by a Tunisian fruit vendor sparked these revolutions , it was the difference between what Arabs experienced and what they expected that provided the fuel .
what this means is that human development , not sec@@ ul@@ ar@@ ization , is what &apos;s key to women &apos;s empowerment in the transforming Middle East .
I don &apos;t think so .
( Applause )
some pund@@ it with too much time on his hands has reck@@ oned that the new experiments are approximately 100 trillion times better than they were in 1960 , 100 trillion times better .
so the question is , what fraction of these planets are actually suitable for life ?
so that &apos;s not so bad . I mean , even with two dozen years , you open up your browser and there &apos;s news of a signal , or you get a cup of coffee .
well , that would be interesting if it was true , and job security for me , but I don &apos;t think the evidence is very good . that &apos;s more , you know , sad than significant .
these sorts of ideas don &apos;t really have any vali@@ dity , that you can &apos;t trust the scientists .
if only they were using the real names , Then you wouldn &apos;t be worried about them on the Internet .
and there &apos;s no progress , we get stuck .
so on my R@@ SS feed , I saw this thing about - I just said something bad about my R@@ SS feed , didn &apos;t I ?
you know what symmetry is , so you don &apos;t need a picture of it .
these are stars being born out of here .
and as you &apos;re thinking about this , we &apos;re continuing to mu@@ tate .
and as they pick that , these become bone , and then they pick another road and these become plat@@ elets , and these become macrophages , and these become T cells .
and we still don &apos;t know why this is happening .
what we do know is , potentially , the brain is reacting in a hyperactive , hyper-@@ plastic way , and creating individuals that are like this .
what I think we are doing is we &apos;re transitioning as a species .
I think we &apos;re transitioning into Homo evolu@@ tis that , for better or worse , is not just a hominid that &apos;s conscious of his or her environment , it &apos;s a hominid that &apos;s beginning to directly and deliberately control the evolution of its own species , of bacteria , of plants , of animals .
and one thing kept bothering me , and that &apos;s , when they &apos;re functioning , penises don &apos;t wiggle .
it &apos;s almost like that old recipe for chicken soup where you boil the chicken until the flavor is just gone .
they power our minds .
and I want you to look at this and see the paths that the cell manufac@@ tures -- these little walking machines , they &apos;re called kin@@ es@@ ins -- that take these huge loads that would challenge an ant in relative size .
once we figure out all that &apos;s going on -- and believe me , we know almost a percent of what &apos;s going on -- once we figure out what &apos;s going on , we &apos;re really going to be able to have a lot of control over what we do with our health , with what we do with future generations , and how long we &apos;re going to live .
I do so many things on this little device .
you would reco@@ il . you would call the police .
like most journalists , I &apos;m an ide@@ alist .
that &apos;s Shar@@ ky .
and she worked with an editor at National Public Radio to try to get a story aired nationally .
( Laughter ) E@@ yes up here .
she was the CBS News correspon@@ dent who was brutally sexually assaulted in Egypt &apos;s Tahrir Square , right after this photo was taken .
anyway , in vitro technology , IVF , is about as intentional as agriculture .
that &apos;s the tune we &apos;re all covering today , all of us .
that won &apos;t do at all .
they will be used for our purposes .
it &apos;s called healthcare -- a system where doctors can prescribe solutions to improve health , not just manage disease .
now none of these solutions -- the prescription pad , the electronic medical record , the waiting room , the army of college students -- are perfect .
as a filmmaker , it worried me .
a tsunami of questions flew out of the mouths of children who the world didn &apos;t think were interested .
but you know , these shells , they &apos;re hard to find .
we started to be able to see where the Nile used to flow .
but you weren &apos;t doing Fer@@ ris@@ -@@ y things at the time ; you were doing gay things at the time .
and I didn &apos;t know where he was going with it at first .
Oh , watch this .
( Laughter ) Next , and this is something deeper .
well , let &apos;s start with Far@@ on Young -- who was born incidentally in 19@@ 32 .
HS : wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait -- let me see if I got this straight .
it had gotten a lot better since 4 a.m. &quot;
we might not ever know .
they were on their own .
but the fact that we still have a lot to learn , that doesn &apos;t mean that we don &apos;t know a lot already .
and we were talking about his life .
he got traded a couple of times , he ended up in the Min@@ ors for most of his career , and he actually ended up in management . he ended up as a General Man@@ ager of the Oakland A &apos;s .
but with a lot of these conditions , that actually isn &apos;t the case , or at least it isn &apos;t the case all the time . it &apos;s as if there &apos;s a rain delay , every single time in many cases .
it was when I became a journalist that I really realized how I was part of this problem , and how we all are part of this problem .
so that &apos;s , to me , a way forward .
he became a recl@@ use .
Tesla &apos;s insight was profound .
so the stadium has a few elements which create that outdoor comfort . first of all , it &apos;s shading . it needs to protect where the people are sitting against strong and warm wind .
and I also hope that you share the idea that if engineers and designers can use all these different cli@@ matic parameters , it will be possible to create really good and comfortable outdoor conditions , to change our thermal perception that we feel comfortable in an outdoor environment , and we can do that with the best passive design , but also using the energy source of the site in Qatar which is the sun .
there &apos;s nobody I &apos;ll meet in my life will ever live beyond 200 years , so we thought that &apos;s a perfect place where we should situ@@ ate our plan and let our imagination take flight .
you know , whether you agree with , you know , legacy or not , we are actually leaving behind digital traces all the time .
I keep saying , &quot; N@@ ets , you live in the past while I &apos;ll create the future , and when I &apos;m done , you can study about it . &quot;
I actually went and sat in on her class . she started by giving students primary source documents from India , Pakistan , from Britain , and I said , &quot; Wow . &quot; then she asked them to separate fact from bias .
humanity is now fully into the techno-@@ scientific age .
traditional fields of study are going to continue to grow and in so doing , inevitably they will meet and create new disciplines .
many of the most successful scientists at work today are mathematically semi-@@ literate .
when something new is discovered , it &apos;s logical then that one of the follow-up steps is to find the mathematical and statistical methods to move its analysis forward .
but through it all , look for a way to break out , to find a field and subject not yet popular .
we were thrilled to have that kind of audience , and just a bit terrified that we hadn &apos;t finished preparing the class yet . ( Laughter ) So we got to work .
we studied what others had done , what we could copy and what we could change .
granted , we don &apos;t have everything in between , because some of the data is hard to get .
in fact , he says , it &apos;s innovation that will keep the West ahead of the developing world , with the more sophisticated , innovative tasks being done in the developed world , and the less sophisticated , shall we say , dru@@ dge work being done in the developing world .
now , what we were trying to understand was , is this true ?
it turned out , in every single case , they came out of the Indian educational system .
so we realized that maybe we had the wrong question , and the right question is , really , can Indians based out of India do innovative work ?
do you know that surgery ?
sure David , if it &apos;s not your hip , it &apos;s truth and beauty .
I met the surgeon , and he took some free X-rays , and I got a good look at them . and you know , even I could tell my hip was bad , and I actually work in marketing .
and I saw a sign .
it &apos;s got some math that I can do .
and - ( Laughter ) And there &apos;s no more powerful force to change every institution than the first generation of digital natives .
I mean , think about Wall Street .
there was no concept of progress .
immediately after the appointment with Kap@@ lan , I went to see Dr. Mar@@ der , a schizophrenia expert who was following me for medication side effects .
&apos;@@ Okay . small . fire on ice . tell them not to kill me .
think about the infrastructure to build it .
the men that carried that attack out were armed with AK-@@ 47s , explosives and hand gren@@ ades .
they used it to great effect .
the Organ@@ ized Cri@@ me and Cor@@ ruption Rep@@ orting Project is staffed by journalists and citizens where they are crowd-@@ sourcing what dictators and terrorists are doing with public funds around the world , and , in a more dramatic case , we &apos;ve seen in Mexico , a country that has been racked by 50,000 narco@@ tic@@ s-@@ related murders in the past six years .
my dad was my hero and my mentor for most of my life , and I &apos;ve spent the last decade watching him disappear .
I don &apos;t want to get Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
currently , what they were doing is that they were using these small fishing boats , and they were cleaning clean lines in an ocean of dirt .
so , we used the same blad@@ der-@@ inflated system , and we took it for testing .
but even with a game so simple , within just a couple days of starting to play , that fog of depression and anxiety went away .
every single second that you are not sitting still , you are actively improving the health of your heart , and your lungs and brains .
now that &apos;s worth + 1 mental resilience , which means you have more mental focus , more discipline , determination and willpower .
we &apos;re clapping for that ?
that means that all of you who just shook hands are bio@@ chemically primed to like and want to help each other .
this is data from a skate park , and this is Ma@@ bel Davis skate park in Austin , Texas . ( skate@@ board sounds ) And the sounds you &apos;re hearing came from eight microphones attached to obstacles around the park , and it sounds like chaos , but actually all the tricks start with a very distinct slap , but successful tricks end with a pop , whereas unsuccessful tricks more of a scratch and a tumble , and tricks on the rail will ring out like a g@@ ong , and voices occupy very unique frequencies in the skate park .
so if we were to render these sounds visually , we might end up with something like this .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I guess it goes without saying that we &apos;ve had a lot of fun doing this .
for instance , the resting brain tends to generate a lot of alpha waves .
I &apos;d never really memori@@ alized myself .
so I start as a baby , and then if you punch the clock , you &apos;ll actually transform the baby into a toddler , and then from a toddler I &apos;m transformed into a teenager .
so , what people were saying to me about the cause of cancer , sources of cancer , or , for that matter , why you are who you are , didn &apos;t make sense .
so , what does this tell you ?
but how does context signal ?
that &apos;s the Chee@@ tah Generation , and Africa &apos;s salvation rests on the backs of these Chee@@ ta@@ hs .
if not , the people will abandon the chief , go somewhere else and set up a new settlement .
you see , in the West , the basic economic and social unit is the individual .
the extended family system pools its resources together .
when they make a profit it is theirs to keep , not for the chief to sequester it from them .
that is not the kind of system Africans had known for centuries .
my name is Than@@ dis@@ wa Ma@@ z@@ wa@@ i .
there &apos;s a sister ship called the Mer@@ cy .
yeah , so what we &apos;d do if we had you who gave the answer as a participant , we would have calibrated the difficulty level of the puzzles to your expertise .
that brings us now to : why does this happen ?
Matt Mills : now , what &apos;s great about this is , there &apos;s no trick@@ ery here .
but what does this new , sort of , approach give us ?
basically one of the contexts that we studied was schools in very remote parts of India .
one of the key issues was battery consumption and charging .
so we said , &quot; Come on , there &apos;s got to be a better way of doing this for sure . &quot;
this mon@@ str@@ osity over here is the CPU , the chip , if you like .
I &apos;m a child of 1984 , and I live in the city of Berlin .
the fall of the Berlin Wall would maybe not &#91; have been &#93; there .
but self-determination and living in the digital age is no contradiction .
if so , then how can we go about creating something that is truly new ?
we can fold a million times faster , we can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations .
they can stretch . they can tear .
but that &apos;s only half of the story -- 99.9 percent of the folding ratios produce not this , but this , the geometric equivalent of noise .
so , for instance , we can plot the length of the edges .
columns are architectural arche@@ types .
and in this case , I used A@@ BS plastic to produce the columns , we used the bigger , faster machine , and they have a steel core inside , so they &apos;re structural , they can bear loads for once .
from 1967 to &apos; 70 , Nigeria fought a war -- the Nig@@ eri@@ a-@@ Bi@@ af@@ ra war .
she was three years old and I was 15 .
Thank you . ( Applause )
so what we do is we send that bullet -- that packet of photons -- millions of times , and record again and again with very clever synchron@@ ization , and from the gigabytes of data , we compu@@ ta@@ tionally weave together to create those fem@@ to-@@ videos I showed you .
now , sometimes you might last longer than 20 minutes , or even shorter , but I think we all suffer from it . and do you have the accompanying guilt ?
and I thought , no , it &apos;s a very intimate look , but it &apos;s not a look a daughter gives her father .
he glan@@ ced at me . &quot; that collar looks to be strang@@ ling you . &quot;
it &apos;s a slu@@ r , short for &quot; c@@ uck@@ old , &quot; for men who have been cheated on by their wives .
I could see pictures they were tagged in , posts they &apos;d written , memes they &apos;d shared , and somehow , seeing that it was a human on the other side of the screen made me feel a little better .
the first person I spoke to was Josh .
absolutely .
DM : and did you not care ?
and I think that a lot of times , that &apos;s what the comment sections really are , it &apos;s really a way to get your anger at the world out on random profiles of strangers , pretty much .
this man is wearing what we call a bee beard . ( Laughter ) A beard full of bees .
over@@ winter@@ ing success is hard , and that &apos;s when most of the colonies are lost , and we found that in the cities , bees are surviving better than they are in the country .
that &apos;s what the chefs go to to use for their cooking , and the honey -- they do live events -- they &apos;ll use that honey at their bars .
it protected China from invaders for 2,000 years .
sometimes the Arab dictators didn &apos;t understand these two hands .
something you find is , freedom is weird .
so , what &apos;s the future ?
so we were , he &apos;s a hero , he &apos;s an astronaut , and we &apos;re all sort of excited , and , you know , I gave myself the liberty of saying , you know , some of the shots I did didn &apos;t really suck that bad .
( &quot; that &apos;s wrong too . &quot; ) ( Laughter ) So , and what happened was , I mean , what I sort of int@@ uned in that is that he remembered it differently .
it &apos;s totally make-@@ believe , yet it &apos;s not to you , and I found that that was a very interesting thing to explore and use , and it caused me to create the next effect that I &apos;ll show you , which is this sort of magic transition , and all I was really attempting to do is basically have the audience cue the effect , so it became a seamless experience for them , that I wasn &apos;t showing you my sort of interpretation , I was showing you what you wanted to see .
so , an interpreter of what ? of a piece of music , right ?
but we can ask the question , &quot; But is it music ? &quot;
( music ) So with all these the@@ atric elements , this pushes me in another role , and that would be , possibly , the dra@@ mat@@ urge .
they have something and they &apos;re going to hold on to it , yeah ? one way of making .
who@@ om , just go back to the beginning .
let &apos;s go to the data , beginning with the most precious thing of all , life .
today , they are never at war with each other .
my acquaint@@ ance with the statistics of human progress , starting with violence but now encompassing every other aspect of our well-being , has for@@ tified my belief that in understanding our tribu@@ lations and wo@@ es , human nature is the problem , but human nature , channeled by Enlightenment norms and institutions , is also the solution .
we are born into a piti@@ less universe , facing steep odds against life-@@ enabling order and in constant jeopardy of falling apart .
we made important contributions to science even though the contributions we made were not the ones originally intended .
you heard me say that respect for science started to improve in Canada in 2015 .
and then the 2015 election rolled around and our party won .
and as I started doing that , I realized that I could tell somebody &apos;s story through my photographs .
I went to those places because I wanted to make some kind of change , and photography happened to be my tool .
I wouldn &apos;t be sitting here right now if this hadn &apos;t happened .
it &apos;s that we all can be part of that wheel .
( Laughter ) I thought my skin complexi@@ on settled that .
even if we look at something like workplace diversity and inclusion , if I asked you what gender-@@ ethnicity combination is least likely to be promoted to senior manag@@ erial positions , who would you think it was ?
and because of that , it has been the center to the city &apos;s drug trade and drug use for decades .
and then he stood up , and he walked out .
but eventually both of my parents entered recovery and maintained recovery from opioid use .
it means , for example , that the smallest male in a group can be the alpha male .
you don &apos;t need to be the biggest and strongest male .
or they start to tickle the babies of the females .
and what you see here is a graph where you see that the lower ranking the male bab@@ oon is , the higher is his cortisol level in the feces , but the alpha male , as you see , has just as high a level as the lo@@ we@@ st-@@ ranking males , and so you may think that being alpha male is nice and dan@@ dy and is wonderful , but it &apos;s actually a very stressful position , and we can demonstrate that physiologically .
WK : after I dropped out of school , I went to library , and I read a book that would -- &quot; U@@ sing Energy , &quot; and I get information about doing the mill .
and this is where it becomes true triple bottom line .
that &apos;s triple bottom line ! okay ?
and behold the glory and bounty that is Bronx County .
happy kids , happy families , happy colleagues .
okay ? my dear friend Maj@@ ora Carter once told me , we have everything to gain and nothing to lose .
Paul Off@@ it : ... V@@ acc@@ ine allowed us to eliminate polio virus .
or Ryan , who can &apos;t go to school , because his immune deficient daughter can &apos;t be risked to have germs come into the house , so he couldn &apos;t leave the house .
you can collect every click , every homework submission , every forum post from tens of thousands of students .
soon after , an organization I volunteer with , All H@@ ands Vol@@ un@@ teers , were on the ground , within days , working as part of the response efforts .
we couldn &apos;t re@@ touch the photo unless it was cleaned , dry and reclaimed .
she was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married , after she had kids , and even after she got divorced and was a single parent , she continued her medical work .
and that meant she knew she only had one shot at collecting her data .
did they eat fish and chips ?
it was fully 25 years before the British and medical -- British and American medical establi@@ shments abandoned the practice of X-@@ ra@@ ying pregnant women .
it &apos;s a fantastic model of collaboration -- thinking partners who aren &apos;t echo chambers .
we delight at ballet virtu@@ os@@ os and tap dancers you will see later on .
we need to be able to measure progression objectively , and ultimately , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure .
no need to go to the clinic for a routine check@@ up .
now , &quot; The Grey Albu@@ m &quot; is a remix .
&quot; the worlds are the important thing .
I collected my findings in a book , placed them chron@@ ologically , stating the name , the patron , the medium and the date .
but that led to a series of no , coming out of the book like ammunition , and adding messages to them , and I started spraying them on the walls .
it &apos;s been really quite a roller coaster experience , but going back to that first question that we asked , is it repli@@ cable ? yeah . it most certainly is repli@@ cable .
our local authority has decided to make everywhere Incredible E@@ di@@ ble , and in support of that have decided to do two things .
if you were in Berlin , Germany , you would have seen my garden at S@@ til@@ wer@@ k Design Center , where ros@@ e@@ mary and la@@ ven@@ der , hyd@@ ran@@ ge@@ a and lemon bal@@ m tra@@ iled up the glass elevators to all six floors .
and tur@@ nar@@ ounds are part and par@@ cel of what I have focused on for most of my professional career .
because Nelson Mandela , as he took over power as the first democra@@ tically-@@ elected president of South Africa , faced a situation of a country that could have slid into the abyss of chaos .
inflation , in general , is coming down across Africa -- that &apos;s the first sign -- in many countries reaching double-@@ digit figures .
so let &apos;s start looking at some of those .
but that &apos;s just part of the story . you have a similar trend with currencies -- currencies going through an extreme time of stability .
for the last 28 years , I &apos;ve been documenting indigenous cultures in more than 70 countries on six continents , and in 2009 I had the great honor of being the sole exhi@@ bit@@ or at the Vancouver Peace Summit .
the big sheets of slate were heavier than the children carrying them , and the kids ho@@ i@@ sted them from their heads using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope and torn cloth .
there were no back doors .
but I realized that what I really needed to know I couldn &apos;t get from training courses .
and meditation or self-@@ inspection is one of the ways -- again it &apos;s not the only one -- it &apos;s one of the ways of gaining this kind of inner power .
but she told the students to sit down .
so what about our fear ?
and I see that we , ordinary people , can do what A@@ ung San Su@@ u Ky@@ i and G@@ hand@@ i and Mandela did .
Kat had a degree from one of the best universities in Africa , oh no , the world .
that got lost both in translation and in transition , and when I realized this , I decided it was time for me to start building bridges between my@@ selves .
but maybe there &apos;s hope , because in the last few years , we &apos;ve begun to see the beginnings of a new area of science using mathematics to model our social systems .
now , to give you an example : the incredibly complex problem of migration across Europe .
I &apos;ve been in Broadmoor for 12 years . &quot;
which I have to say , would have been hard for him to deny , because he was standing under a giant oil painting of himself .
we travel across the world with our note@@ pads in our hands , and we wait for the gems .
he got into a &quot; frac@@ as &quot; in a bar , he called it .
and then he phoned me .
we found P@@ ast@@ or Bob and offered to give the response some infrastructure .
we need to canvas and send out volunteers .
( together ) MO : insurance won &apos;t cover it ? CO : juice boxes coming in an hour ?
Mo : I can donate three water he@@ aters , but someone needs to come pick them up .
we had to learn how to answer questions quickly and to solve problems in a minute or less ; otherwise , something more urgent would come up , and it wouldn &apos;t get done .
Mo : we didn &apos;t get our authority from the board of selec@@ t@@ men or the emergency management director or the United Way .
CO : the timing .
in a disaster , however , you start with all of the interest and none of the capacity .
and if I had to pick a group that I think is our Invisible College , is our generation &apos;s collection of people trying to take these tools and to press it into service , not for more arguments , but for better arguments , I &apos;d pick the open-source programmers .
no democracy anywhere in the world offers this feature to its citizens for either legislation or for budgets , even though those are the things done with our consent and with our money .
part of the problem , of course , is just a lack of information .
you people , the Church of TED , are a very optimistic community .
and because of the rain until four o &apos;clock in the afternoon , nobody went to the polling stations .
for the last 30 years , political scientists have observed that there is a constant decline in electoral turnout , and the people who are least interested to vote are the people whom you expect are going to gain most out of voting .
but if we &apos;re going to see what went wrong , we &apos;re going to end up with the same five revolutions .
but I do believe that we should be also very clear that now when we put the transparency at the center of politics where the message is , &quot; It &apos;s transparency , stupid . &quot;
this is why you have checks and balances .
and this is Go@@ e@@ the , who is neither Bulg@@ arian nor a political scientist , some centuries ago he said , &quot; There is a big shadow where there is much light . &quot;
I have been tempted at every step of my career , tempted personally and tempted by coaching of others , to mute who I am in the world .
and that , in the intercourse with foreign nations , the majesty of the people of the United States may not be ha@@ zar@@ ded by an appearance of singularity -- i.e. , we don &apos;t want to look like bloody weir@@ dos .
and our idea is that this design would inspire manufacturers and other people of influence to take this model and run with it .
so here &apos;s an overhead warmer and a CP@@ AP .
it only fits a single baby , and the idea here is it &apos;s obvious how you ought to use this device .
another example -- again , silly Mom .
S@@ hip@@ loads of thu@@ ja are what my body wants to say to your body .

in that moment , Fr@@ aser says , &quot; I am lost already , but not you ... not you . &quot;
&quot; here , &quot; Jimmy said .
it was a place where nothing very much had happened .
just moving on , is it possible , taking that idea of mind , body , body-@@ building , to sup@@ plant the first body , the biological body , with the second , the body of architecture and the built environment .
as John Cage said , &quot; We are not moving towards some kind of goal .
so what about if you had a machine that could do it for you ?
&quot; before I die , I want to be tried for piracy . &quot;
so I had gone on to testing my sensors and as all scientists have stu@@ mbles along their work , I also had a couple of problems in my first generation of sensors .
I know , I &apos;m sorry , but let me introduce you to the one doughnut that might actually turn out to be good for us .
what a factory makes is never the point , and the workers could not care less who buys their products .
journalistic coverage of Chinese factories , on the other hand , plays up this relationship between the workers and the products they make .
for example , I recently wrote an article in The New Yorker magazine , but I can &apos;t afford to buy an ad in it .
Min &apos;s sister turned to him and said , &quot; Some people actually understand these things . you don &apos;t understand shit . &quot;
and what &apos;s more , the same is happening across the crises of the world .
I have witnessed this reality .
so when they see that display , it really does just renew everyone &apos;s faith in humanity .
I hope you &apos;re willing to come with me on this , but my real problem with the mindset that is so out to defeat death is if you &apos;re anti-@@ death , which to me translates as anti-@@ life , which to me translates as anti-@@ nature , it also translates to me as anti-@@ woman , because women have long been identified with nature .
so the best thing about my attitude , I think , is that it &apos;s real .
( Laughter ) And I am so grateful to you .
Osama bin Laden was not caught by artificial intelligence .
for example , they charged Saudi foreign fighters substantially more than Liby@@ ans , money that would have otherwise gone to al Qaeda .
January and February are the dry months in Haiti , yet many of the camps had developed standing water .
social media were blocked at the fire@@ wall .
but the way that our institutions are designed , in our rather 18th-century , centralized model , is to channel the flow of values through voting , once every four years , once every two years , at best , once a year . this is a rather ane@@ mic and thin way , in this era of social media , for us to actually express our values .
&quot; there is a hero in all of us , &quot; is their slogan .
this is an early design for this little three-@@ wheel .
they were a pervasive presence .
it matters a great deal .
and it said , very simply , &quot; I am thinking now . &quot;
and as the father was admini@@ stering these instructions , a car drove by , slowly , and just after it passed the father and the teenagers , a hand went out from the front passenger window , and -- &quot; B@@ am , B@@ am ! &quot; -- killing the father .

first of all , there &apos;s a long history of anti@@ pa@@ thy between science and the law in American ju@@ ri@@ sp@@ ru@@ dence .
none of them thought they couldn &apos;t see the person &apos;s face .
so you could really say that researchers trying to understand the cause of disease without being able to have human stem cell models were much like investigators trying to figure out what had gone terribly wrong in a plane crash without having a black box , or a flight recorder .
so imagine he tells you to move the top truck left .
if the space I &apos;m sending it in is not effective , that communication can &apos;t happen .
in fact , 65 deci@@ bels is the very level at which this big survey of all the evidence on noise and health found that , that is the threshold for the danger of my@@ o@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction .
let &apos;s broaden the perspective a little bit and look at cities .
or who say , don &apos;t spend all your budget on a huge screen in the conference room , and then place one tiny microphone in the middle of a table for 30 people . ( Laughter ) If you can hear me , you can understand me without seeing me . if you can see me without hearing me , that does not work .
any dot above that line , and you &apos;ll quickly notice that that includes most countries in the world , represents unnecessary surplus , and is likely to reflect levels of waste in each country .
that &apos;s what &apos;s in fields around the world every single year .

it &apos;s like I gave you a new car and you &apos;re complaining about not finding parking .
Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you . very lucky to be here . Thank you . ( Applause )
there are campaigns spreading across university campuses to make their colleges conflic@@ t-@@ free .
and here &apos;s this really sophisticated technology coming down the road , all these associated social , moral , ethical questions , and we scientists are just lousy at explaining to the public just exactly what it is we &apos;re doing in those labs .
if you had spaces like this all over the world , it could really change the perception of who &apos;s allowed to do biotech .
and there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this .
and humans do the same thing . ( Laughter ) So they do this both when they have power sort of chronically , and also when they &apos;re feeling powerful in the moment .
it seems to be related to gender .
so what happens , okay , you take a role change , what happens if you do that at a really minimal level , like this tiny manipulation , this tiny intervention ?
a couple more .
so this is what we find .
so for five minutes , nothing , and this is worse than being hec@@ k@@ led .
it &apos;s about the presence that they &apos;re bringing to the speech .
so I said , fake it till you make it .
I am an impostor .
con@@ figure your brain to cope the best in that situation .
and it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of language , and how what we call people so often distances us from them , and makes them little .
and A@@ re@@ tha Franklin was shouting &quot; R-@@ E-@@ S-@@ P-@@ E-@@ C-@@ T , &quot; the women &apos;s hips were sw@@ aying and little kids were trying to grab the paint@@ brushes , but it was their day .

I talked about it a little at Oxford two years ago , and some of you visited A to Z manufacturing , which is one of the great , real companies in East Africa .
UNICEF came forward and said , &quot; We &apos;ll buy most of the nets , and then we &apos;ll give them away , as part of the global fund &apos;s and the U.N. &apos; s commitment to pregnant women and children , for free . &quot;

so the bus dilig@@ ently carries the data into the computer to the memory , to the CPU , the V@@ RAM , etc . , and it &apos;s an actual working computer . that &apos;s a bus , really . ( Laughter ) And it looks kind of fast . that &apos;s a mouse driver , where it &apos;s XY . ( Laughter ) It looks like it &apos;s happening kind of quickly , but it &apos;s actually a very slow computer , and when I realized how slow this computer was compared to how fast a computer is , it made me wonder about computers and technology in general .
someone who &apos;s creative actually loves to learn from mistakes .
they &apos;re targeted social media systems around leaders .
what the likes of Sebastian are starting to rightfully ask is , shouldn &apos;t they own their reputation data ?
ultimately , when we get it right , reputation capital could create a massive positive disruption in who has power , trust and influence .
joy ?
joy is nice , I guess , but it &apos;s kind of light -- not substantial .
and at the same time , I had another realization , that if these are the things that bring us joy , then why does so much of the world look like this ?
there are waves running along the side of the building , and these squi@@ gg@@ ly can@@ op@@ ies over the entr@@ y@@ way , and the whole building bends toward the entrance in a welcoming gesture .
on the most basic level , the drive toward joy is the drive toward life .
without needles and radioactivity , without any kind of clinical reason , we can go down the street and record from your friends &apos; and neighbors &apos; brains while they do a variety of cognitive tasks , and we use a method called functional magnetic resonance imaging .
the fact is , though , that even when we &apos;re alone , we &apos;re a profoundly social creature . we &apos;re not a solitary mind built out of properties that kept it alive in the world independent of other people . in fact , our minds depend on other people . they depend on other people , and they &apos;re expressed in other people , so the notion of who you are , you often don &apos;t know who you are until you see yourself in interaction with people that are close to you , people that are enemies of you , people that are agnostic to you .
the topic that it &apos;s focused on , the question is whether or not all these digital technologies are affecting people &apos;s ability to earn a living , or , to say it a little bit different way , are the dro@@ ids taking our jobs ?
but despite this challenge -- personally , I &apos;m still a huge digital optimist , and I am supre@@ mely confident that the digital technologies that we &apos;re developing now are going to take us into a Utop@@ ian future , not a dystopian future .
now , what I don &apos;t think is that Jen@@ sen got extremely lucky and happened to land in the one set of villages where technology made things better .
and their first recommendation of how to fix this problem , because it is a problem , because it sends us all down blind alle@@ ys , their first recommendation of how to fix this problem is to make it easier to publish negative results in science , and to change the incentives so that scientists are encouraged to post more of their negative results in public .
the results were un@@ available to them .
but they didn &apos;t hold the line . in 2008 , a study was conducted which showed that half of all of trials published by journals edited by members of the IC@@ M@@ J@@ E weren &apos;t properly registered , and a quarter of them weren &apos;t registered at all .
the elders of the Internet were willing to part with it for a short while , and she looks at it and she says , &quot; This is the Internet ? the whole Internet ? is it heavy ? &quot;
and after 70 hours of intensive singing lessons , he found that the music was able to literally rewire the brains of his patients and create a homo@@ log@@ ous speech center in their right hemisphere to compensate for the left hemisphere &apos;s damage .
isn &apos;t it incredible that we can &apos;t read each other &apos;s minds , when we can touch each other , taste each other , perhaps , if we get close enough , but we can &apos;t read each other &apos;s minds .
but he was a passionate teacher , and I remember one of our earlier classes with him , he was projecting images on the wall , asking us to think about them , and he put up an image of a painting .
the Great Hall at the M@@ et is one of the great portals of the world , awe-inspiring , like a medieval cathedral .
from there , you can walk in any direction to almost any culture .
and I used to run away from home , when I know that maybe the police might be coming around the ninth or 10th of June or so .
you remember ? and you learned the answer , and you &apos;ve carried this answer in your head for 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 years : the answer is the same . the answer is the same . so when you &apos;re asked what the lengths are , you say they &apos;re the same , but they &apos;re not the same , because I &apos;ve changed it .
he wisely explains this to us . he says design thinking must tackle big systems for the challenges we have .
there are two pop@@ -@@ ups bringing you some other information , and a final article with a link out to the original article .
us humans , of course , we don &apos;t move around marking our territory by scent , like dogs .
no , what you &apos;ve just drawn is more like a diagram or a schematic .
now , call me old-fashioned , but I think a public transport route map should have lines , because that &apos;s what they are , yeah ?
any gaps that appeared in the outskirts were filled again .
in fact , most of the side streets even with their name , and for good measure , also a couple of landmarks , some of them sign@@ ified by little symbols , others by these i@@ some@@ tric three-dimensional bird &apos;s-@@ eye-@@ view drawings .
it comes completely conscious . it &apos;s got state-of-the-art lobes .
his choices ran through to me . he was a smoker , like most people were . this is my son .
so I started putting this in my slide dec@@ ks , and I got even more ob@@ noxious , and I went to my doctor , and I said , &quot; I &apos;d like to actually get my blood@@ work .
and open doesn &apos;t mean that there &apos;s no money .
you do have to solve a CAPTCHA as well . ( Laughter ) And if you &apos;d like to build corporate structures on top of it , that &apos;s okay too . that &apos;s all in the consent , so if you don &apos;t like those terms , you don &apos;t come in .
methods , what did you do ? results , what was the observation ?
everyone over there shout . ( shou@@ ts ) Where &apos;s the sound coming from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What &apos;s the point ? the point is what science does for us .
I had also had the privilege since the last 37 years to work on several masterpieces as you can see behind me , but basically to do what ? well , to assess , for example , the state of conservation . see here the face of the Mad@@ onna of the C@@ hair that when just shining a UV light on it you suddenly see another , different lady , aged lady , I should rather say .
secondly , under the beef protocol of that agreement , African countries that produce beef have quotas to export beef du@@ ty-@@ free to the European Union market .
money is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order .
aid increases the resources available to governments , and that makes working in a government the most profitable thing you can have , as a person in Africa seeking a career .
I hope I have achieved that .
traditional business wisdom holds that trust is earned by predictable behavior , but when everything is consistent and standardized , how do you create meaningful experiences ?
I want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging .
and the trick here is to use a single , readable sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost , and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what &apos;s being described .
now of course , some of us , if we truly are cosmopolitan , would like to see that ratio being brought down to one-@@ is@@ -to-@@ one .
the end result was six ministers resigned , the first speaker of the house in 300 years was forced to resign , a new government was elected on a mandate of transparency , 120 MP@@ s stepped down at that election , and so far , four MP@@ s and two lords have done jail time for fraud .
this is Bir@@ g@@ it@@ ta J@@ ó@@ n@@ s@@ d@@ ó@@ t@@ ti@@ r . she &apos;s an Icelandic M@@ P .
skepticism , because you must always be challenging .
so it &apos;s not all bad news . I mean , there definitely is progress on the line , but I think what we find is that the closer that we get right into the heart of power , the more opaque , closed it becomes .
I remember in Iraq , for example , that we went through a period of feeling that we should delay democracy .
the result was that I found stuck outside my office a huge crowd of people , this is actually a photograph taken in Libya but I saw the same scene in Iraq of people standing outside screaming for the elections , and when I went out and said , &quot; What is wrong with the inter@@ im prov@@ incial council ?
after I speak to you today , I &apos;m going on a radio program called &quot; Any Qu@@ es@@ tions , &quot; and the thing you will have noticed about politicians on these kinds of radio programs is that they never , ever say that they don &apos;t know the answer to a question . it doesn &apos;t matter what it is .
in Britain , it could mean looking to the French , learning from the French , getting directly elected mayors in place in a French comm@@ une system .
if you were black , it was a summer of hate .
you can see this as early as even in newborn infants .
when you bring people into the laboratory and you ask them if they &apos;re willing to engage in safe but disgusting behaviors like eating chocolate that &apos;s been baked to look like dog poop , or in this case eating some me@@ al@@ worms that are perfectly healthy but pretty gross , your score on that scale actually predicts whether or not you &apos;ll be willing to engage in those behaviors .
this last project is also of components .
it was Bihar all over again .
globally , 1.3 billion people live on less than $ 1.@@ 25 a day , and the work I did in Uganda represents the traditional approach to these problems that has been practiced since 1944 , when winners of World War II , 500 founding fathers , and one lonely founding mother , gathered in New Hampshire , USA , to establish the Bre@@ t@@ ton Woods institutions , including the World Bank .
today , each of these elements is opening up due to dramatic changes in the global environment .
open knowledge , open aid , open governance , and together , they represent three key shifts that are transforming development and that also hold greater hope for the problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar .
you &apos;re up all night . you &apos;re walking till dawn .
I have come to think it &apos;s one of the most powerful brain systems on Earth for both great joy and great sorrow .
so with that pre@@ am@@ ble , I want to go into discussing the two most profound social trends .
they &apos;re both perfectly good ways of thinking .
in fact , there &apos;s many more male geniuses in the world .
I &apos;m always astonished when people come to me and say , &quot; Why is it that men are so adulter@@ ous ? &quot;
anyway .
people around the world , in a study of 37 societies , want to be in love with the person that they marry .
everybody knows that .
and they were all at a conference in Beijing .
Thank you .
they communicate their delight to their children , who respond with smiles , and a desire to achieve more and to learn more .
it is the model for all future relationships with friends , with partners and with their own children .
I was asked to help the director of a large institution to help prevent the separation of children from their families .
since my first visit to Ce@@ aus@@ esc@@ u &apos;s institution , I &apos;ve seen hundreds of such places across 18 countries , from the Cz@@ ech Republic to Sudan .
in Mol@@ do@@ va , young women raised in institutions are 10 times more likely to be trafficked than their peers , and a Russian study found that two years after leaving institutions , young adults , 20 percent of them had a criminal record , 14 percent were involved in prostitution , and 10 percent had taken their own lives .
24 / 7 is a little bit of an exaggeration , but it does take practice . now , some people will say , well , magic , that must be the work of some evil supernatural force . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) Whoa .
the odds of getting it are 4,@@ 16@@ 5 to one .
so I want to talk a little bit about seeing the world from a totally unique point of view , and this world I &apos;m going to talk about is the micro world .
this is from La@@ ha@@ ina , and when we &apos;re walking along a beach , we &apos;re actually walking along millions of years of biological and geological history .
and I started taking pictures with my three-dimensional microscopes .
the second thing is that due to the unique sensory abilities of this mammal , if we study this mammal , we &apos;re going to get great insight into our diseases of the senses , such as blindness and deafness .
so again , if you just look at this bat , you realize sound is very important for its survival .
well , normally , a charity starts with the cause , and someone that is directly affected by a cause .
so now , that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer .
I think that &apos;s a question we haven &apos;t really answered yet , but I think something that has the potential to be an answer is that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with the contents of our moment@@ -to-@@ moment experiences .
as it turns out , people are substantially less happy when their minds are wandering than when they &apos;re not .
this was a tragedy , but it really forced us to re@@ focus what it is that we were doing .
so thank you very much . ( Applause )
but people think that my job is to let the good words make that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary , and keep the bad words out .
so , you can &apos;t get a smaller ham .
here &apos;s another one : &quot; sorry I didn &apos;t respond to you earlier .
you just didn &apos;t want to respond to that person that time .
here &apos;s the last one : you &apos;re talking to somebody , and you say , &quot; Sorry , got work , gotta go . &quot;
I &apos;m sure you all have &quot; friends &quot; that have used online dating . ( Laughter ) And they would tell you about that guy that had no hair when he came , or the woman that didn &apos;t look at all like her photo .
that really is strange . how do we explain this ?
and when I asked her why no pictures , she said , &quot; It &apos;s a crime scene . no photographs allowed . &quot;
and it &apos;s called affordability .
what if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one ?
Ma@@ hal@@ ak@@ sh@@ mi is chasing me , I am keeping in the back pocket .
fascism , in contrast , tells me that my nation is supreme , and that I have exclusive obligations towards it .
Yuval Noah Har@@ ari : well , in the end , there isn &apos;t such a big difference between the corporations and the governments , because , as I said , the questions is : who controls the data ?
YNH : Thank you very much .
the road was too rough .
the two words come from the Latin root &quot; p@@ ater , &quot; which means &quot; father . &quot;
we have helped to start 40,000 businesses .
and so I &apos;m going to take a few examples from our work .
the issue is what happens with these guys that actually indulge into playing video games like five hours per week , 10 hours per week , 15 hours per week .
so clearly playing those action games doesn &apos;t lead to attention problems .
now , we can measure that kind of skills in the lab .
the other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight .
third . good ! this is hard , right ?
so , the wings pump up air in lemonade bottles , which are on top of that .
I mean , you have the typical European cities , with a dense urban core , good public transportation mostly , not a lot of road capacity .
the first day with the congestion charges looked like this .
this is the last day with the congestion charges , July 31 , and you see the same street but now it &apos;s summer , and summer in Stockholm is a very nice and light time of the year , and the first day without the congestion charges looked like this .
now these traffic figures are really exciting and a little bit surprising and very useful to know , but I would say that the most surprising slide here I &apos;m going to show you today is not this one . it &apos;s this one .
no , on the contrary , they changed , up to a point where we now have 70 percent support for keeping the charges , meaning that -- I mean , let me repeat that : 70 percent of the population in Stockholm want to keep a price for something that used to be free .
each day , people make new decisions , and people change and the world changes around them , and each day all of these decisions are sort of nu@@ dged ever so slightly away from rush hour car driving in a way that people don &apos;t even notice .
I had extensive and life-threatening injuries .
and I said , &quot; What ? &quot;
I realized Sister Sam was right .
and then I knew , just like before , that I had a choice : I could keep fighting this , or I could let go and accept not only my body , but the circumstances of my life .
then I learned to navigate , and I flew my friends around Australia .
I &apos;m a designer and an educator .
opinion polls from all over the Muslim world show that there is very little interest among Muslims in a global holy war against the West , against the far enemy .
satellite television and the Internet are informing and empowering young Muslims in exciting new ways .
whether it was concoc@@ ting delicious meals from stolen scraps from the warehouse , sculpting people &apos;s hair with to@@ en@@ ail cli@@ ppers , or constructing weights from b@@ oul@@ ders in laundry bags tied on to tree limbs , prisoners learn how to make do with less , and many of them want to take this ingenuity that they &apos;ve learned to the outside and start restaurants , barber shops , personal training businesses .
Thank you . ( Applause )
as I took off with his sneakers , there was tears in his eyes .
you know what the problem is with you , hom@@ ie ?
so what if we had better models in the lab that could not only mimic us better than rats but also reflect our diversity ?
wouldn &apos;t you rather test to see if those cancer drugs you &apos;re going to take are going to work on your cancer ?
the U.S. government decided to take action , and forced those patent holders to make their patents available to share with others to enable the production of airplanes .
Nelson decided to become a treatment activist and join up with other groups .
the thing is the sun is not always available to you , because at sunset it disappears below the horizon .
the beetle comes out from underneath the filter and it does a right-hand turn , because it comes back under the sky that it was originally ori@@ ent@@ ated to and then re@@ ori@@ ent@@ ates itself back to the direction it was originally going in .
it isn &apos;t climbing . it isn &apos;t dancing , because its body temperature is actually relatively low .
so what have we learned from these animals with a brain that &apos;s the size of a grain of rice ?
are there any Lebanese here tonight , by applause ?

also in the Bible , one sees that the death penalty was the accepted punishment for crimes such as homosexuality , adultery , bl@@ asp@@ he@@ my , i@@ dol@@ atry , talking back to your parents -- ( Laughter ) -- and picking up sticks on the Sabbath .
this was an argument from the political scientist James Pay@@ ne .
M@@ all@@ ory post@@ ulated that there is something in man that responds to the challenge of the mountain , and I wonder if that &apos;s the case whether there &apos;s something in the challenge itself , in the endeavor , and particularly in the big , unfinished , chunky challenges that face humanity that call out to us , and in my experience that &apos;s certainly the case .
Thank you very much .
I met these founders just weeks after they had launched , and now , in two years , what would you do for five dollars ?
so the first un@@ proven claim is that you can use brain scans to read people &apos;s thoughts and emotions .

( &quot; my Israeli Friends . I don &apos;t hate you . I don &apos;t want War . &quot; ) This never happened before , and this is two people supposed to be enemies , we &apos;re on the verge of a war , and suddenly people on Facebook are starting to say , &quot; I like this guy . I love those guys . &quot;
and it goes the other way around .
so that way , if their worst fears came true , their businesses were ready .
maybe then we &apos;d spend less time worrying about serial killers and plane crashes , and more time concerned with the subt@@ ler and slower disasters we face : the silent buildup of plaque in our arteries , the gradual changes in our climate .
but that system has tons of problems .
so when we &apos;re talking about cutting government spending , this is the pie we &apos;re talking about , and Americans overwhelmingly , and it doesn &apos;t matter what party they &apos;re in , overwhelmingly like that big 55 percent chunk .
second doctor : we &apos;re gonna take this nice and easy , Ja@@ ke@@ .@@ First doctor : well , do you want to sit up ? that &apos;s fine .
this is a picture of Mau@@ rice Dru@@ on , the Hon@@ or@@ ary Per@@ pe@@ tual Secretary of L &apos;@@ Acade@@ mie fran@@ ca@@ ise , the French Academy .
this would be an example of how to do that .
well , there are a number of interesting conclusions , I think , from this and many similar kinds of analyses of hundreds of English verbs .
first , there &apos;s a level of fine-@@ gra@@ ined conceptual structure , which we automatically and unconsciously compute every time we produce or utter a sentence , that governs our use of language .
in the workplace , for example , there &apos;s often a tension over whether an employee can socialize with the boss , or refer to him or her on a first-@@ name basis .
I &apos;d also seen a few k@@ ung fu movies , and secretly I kind of thought I might be able to learn how to fly , but I was very young at the time .
well , obviously it changed things .
we need an exercise .
now in life , and in meditation , there &apos;ll be times when the focus becomes a little bit too intense , and life starts to feel a bit like this .
but of course the most dangerous animal is the mosquito .
we are going to use it in and around humans .
so basically , we &apos;ve used those two factors .
and what &apos;s the result ?
we &apos;ve also done this in agriculture .
both have a side benefit , which is that we reduce pesticide use tremendously .
they rise or fall , they live or die , as one .
we circle around flags , and then we can trust each other .
did anybody notice that in two of the three debates , Obama wore a blue tie and Rom@@ ney wore a red tie ?
but the problem isn &apos;t primarily that we &apos;re elec@@ ting bad people to Congress .
so I loved writing so much that I &apos;d come home from school , and I would take out pieces of paper , and I would staple them together , and I would fill those blank pages with words and pictures just because I loved using my imagination .
you can go to Holy Na@@ me , which is co@@ ed , or St. John &apos;s , which is all boys .
and my local paper celebrated the news .
I &apos;m expecting the release of a chapter book called &quot; Plat@@ yp@@ us Police Squ@@ ad : the Fro@@ g Who Cro@@ aked . &quot;
and I travel the country visiting countless schools , letting lots of kids know that they draw great cats .
now , in order for a clinical trial to be considered ethically acceptable , participants must be given the relevant information in a way in which they can understand , and must freely consent to participate in the trial .
if you come from a developing country like myself , I urge you to hold your government to a more thorough review of the clinical trials which are authorized in your country .
so as the seasons changed , and it was time to plan the dance again , one girl named Bri@@ anna spoke up , and she said , &quot; My dad can &apos;t come to the dance , and this whole thing is making me sad . &quot;
this is the first outfit change on the TED stage , so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it , I think .
and that happened a lot : &quot; you pom@@ mies , you can &apos;t play cricket , rugby . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re on the equator here -- that &apos;s these two lines here , the red line and the purple line -- the amount of nitric oxide that &apos;s released is the area under the curve , it &apos;s the area in this space here .
my day job is saying to people , &quot; You &apos;ve got skin cancer , it &apos;s caused by sunlight , don &apos;t go in the sun . &quot;
now the authorities at C@@ CN@@ Y were getting tired of me being there .
children need a network . children need to be part of a tribe , a family , a community .
it &apos;s ridiculous not to have a sound immigration policy to welcome those who want to come here and be part of this great nation , or we can send back home with an education to help their people rise up out of poverty .
Thank you very much .
so , where are the robots ?
it did not start that trend .
but I think if &quot; The Wizard of Oz &quot; were made today , the wizard would say , &quot; Dorothy , you are the savior of Oz that the prophecy fore@@ told .
I know from my own experience that Princess Leia did not provide the adequate context that I could have used in navigating the adult world that is co-@@ ed . ( Laughter ) I think there was a first-@@ kiss moment when I really expected the credits to start rolling because that &apos;s the end of the movie , right ?
this is how war starts .
she was a young mother . she was someone who liked to party .
great person .
I had the honor of being one of those reporters that lived through that siege , and I say I have the honor and the privilege of being there because it &apos;s taught me everything , not just about being a reporter , but about being a human being .
fif@@ ty-six percent of the parliam@@ ent@@ arians are women , which is fantastic , and there &apos;s also within the national constitution now , you &apos;re actually not allowed to say Hut@@ u or Tut@@ si .
even people who say they speak English , only 14 percent pass .
soon , a story develops .
on his own , he wrote these sentences .
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at Seven@@ teen magazine .
the answer is easy .
abuse thrives only in silence .
and then things get really horrible , as his skin ri@@ ps apart , and he sees a virus coming out from his insides .
now , finally , I am often so disappointed when people think that I &apos;m advocating a du@@ mbing down of science .
and when a Wall Street trader comes into work in the morning , she does not write a listing for every financial derivative she wants to sell today and then post that listing on multiple websites and wait for potential buyers to get in touch and start negotiating the terms on which she might trade .
so imagine that policymakers outlined a facility .
and they might be aware that they would have to fund vetting and training if they wanted to go into that market .
it seems that everybody is getting into the act .
again , the same thing with coding .
what &apos;s your name ? where are you from ?
a deple@@ table energy ? fossil fuel ?
so how are we doing this in the lab ?
or we &apos;re , &quot; Oh , yeah , this party , let me take a picture . &quot;
and when colors came out everywhere , a mood of change started transforming the spirit of people .
they are not . they are human beings with different views and different visions for the world .
our world is defined by the pace of change .
but when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , I see a promising future and lasting change .
radical openness is still a distant future in the field of school education .
but in the 1970s , some countries caught up .
the red dot shows you spending per student relative to a country &apos;s wealth .
in bureaucratic school systems , teachers are often left alone in classrooms with a lot of prescription on what they should be teaching .
they make them coherent over sustained periods of time , and they ensure that what they do is consistently implemented .
I ended up in physics by accident .
and we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue .
so ownership networks reveal the patterns of share@@ holding relations .
this is the TN@@ C network which we analyzed .
they &apos;re mostly financial institutions in the US and the UK .
in love , we want to have , we want to know the beloved .
but more importantly , for me to begin to understand who are the couples who have an erotic spark , what susta@@ ins desire , I had to go back to the original definition of ero@@ ticism , the mystical definition , and I went through it through a bi@@ fur@@ cation by looking , actually , at trauma , which is the other side .
and if you tell them , &quot; Hey kid@@ do , the world &apos;s a great place .
we treat biotechnology with the same scrutiny we apply to nuclear power plants .
it &apos;s not hard : it &apos;s just three oxygen atoms .
we think the one that got the dinosaurs was about five miles wide .
Andrew , can you put that chart up ?
the worst thing we can do is say , je@@ ez , I got enough to worry about without worrying about an asteroid . ( Laughter ) That &apos;s a mistake that could literally cost us our future .
actually , no .
interestingly enough , when you start to crank the data , these pockets of futu@@ reless language speakers all around the world turn out to be , by and large , some of the world &apos;s best sa@@ vers .
&quot; excuse me , would you mind if I per@@ use your stock portfolio ?
take all of that data , combine it , and this map is what you get .
does this have cumulative effects ?
and Aurora now knows that she can play the game with this robotic arm , but she has not lost the ability to use her biological arms to do what she ple@@ ases .
as fast as we can reset our computers , the brain activity shifts to start representing this new tool , as if this too was a part of that primate &apos;s body .
this is CB@@ 1 fulfilling its dream in Japan under the control of the brain activity of a primate .
this is the thing that we are doing , giving them opportunities where they can rise .
they went right in here . I was a young man at the time .
and he said that , in fact - Let me see if this thing works .
do you get how serious this problem is ?
it was kind of a nasty way to get mat@@ ur@@ ation , but we got it , because we all understood it , and for the first time that I could remember , there were mass protests against this corruption .
and he &apos;s telling us that for the $ 1.6 billion cost of the project , one billion dollars has been traced to offshore bank accounts .
( Laughter ) But the point is that the bitter experience of S@@ ection 34 , that plot to per@@ vert Parliament , that bitter experience that took place in August , when we were supposed to be celebrating our independence , going into September , forced me to check myself and rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ate my bear@@ ings , and to go back into some of the work , some of the stuff I &apos;d written and some of the exchanges I &apos;d had with the officials to see what was really what .
and the most famous case was what we came to call the Secret Sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship Scan@@ dal , where in fact there was about 60 million dollars in government money that had been dispersed in a series of scholarships , and the scholarships hadn &apos;t been advertised , and so and so on and so on .
you see ? this is what we &apos;re dealing with , okay ?
it &apos;s been ignored .
we had the journalist &#91; Heather &#93; Bro@@ oke speaking about her battle against government corruption , and she introduced me to this website , Ala@@ ve@@ te@@ li@@ .com .
you could see what I applied for and what replies I got .
you can take a hardware and have that hardware do different things at different times , or have different parts of the hardware doing different things .
we constantly have to kind of dial them back .
we &apos;ve got to hook them up with parents .
the other one said , &quot; Over@@ reaction ! over@@ reaction ! &quot;
and he &apos;s teaching her how to browse .
( Laughter ) So I left them for a couple of months .
they &apos;d got a zero . I gave them a test .
so I said , &quot; Okay , but how long did it take you before you decided that you can &apos;t understand anything ? &quot;
well , they &apos;re going to places that have policy , like China .
Congress putting four and a half billion dollars on the table ?
however , DNA analysis informs us only about the beginning and the end , telling us nothing about what happened in the middle .
and for the economists out there , you may be interested to know I actually made a pretty predictable income , which was shocking to me , given I had no regular customers , but pretty much 60 bucks on a Tuesday , 90 bucks on a Friday .
fans who worked in museums and stores and any kind of public space would wave their hands if I would decide to do a last-@@ minute , spontaneous , free gig .
and the media asked , &quot; Amanda , the music business is tan@@ king and you encourage piracy .
and it got worse , not better .
what are we going to do ?
and we did that , without using fire to damage the soil , and the plants are free to grow .
I believe I &apos;ve shown you how we can work with nature at very low cost to reverse all this .
I can think of almost nothing that offers more hope for our planet , for your children , and their children , and all of humanity .
CA : that is an astonishing talk , truly an astonishing talk , and I think you heard that we all are cheering you on your way .
Thank you so mu@@ ch@@ .@@ AS : well , thank you . Thank you . Thank you , Chris .
I grew up there . I raised my sons there .
standing up for yourself doesn &apos;t have to mean embracing violence .
he got his paper back expecting a near-@@ perfect score , and couldn &apos;t believe it when he looked across the room at me and held up a zero .
not really a big deal .
he tried to kill himself in grade 10 when a kid who could still go home to Mom and Dad had the audacity to tell him , &quot; Get over it . &quot;
to this day , kids are still being called names .
this is what happens when we confuse morality with fru@@ g@@ ality .
it &apos;s one thing to believe that flies have emo@@ tion@@ -like states , but how do we actually find out whether that &apos;s true or not ?
then when you give those trained flies the chance to choose between a tube with the sho@@ ck-@@ paired odor and another odor , it avoids the tube containing the blue odor that was paired with shock .
another direct result was a young grad student named Ben No@@ v@@ ak , who had been obsessed with passenger pigeons since he was 14 and had also learned how to work with ancient DNA , himself sequenced the passenger pigeon , using money from his family and friends .
we &apos;ll get help from Bob L@@ anza and Mike Mc@@ Gre@@ w to get that into germ plas@@ m that can go into chickens that can produce passenger pigeon squ@@ abs that can be raised by b@@ and-@@ tailed pigeon parents , and then from then on , it &apos;s passenger pigeons all the way , maybe for the next six million years .
so inertia versus momentum .
you can tell politicians that these cuts &#91; can cost &#93; lives .
and so that was the trigger to make us think , wow , you know , with episo@@ dic content , especially seri@@ alized , it &apos;s so powerful to have all the episodes at once .
RH : well , you know , my first company -- we were very process obsessed .
CA : OK , I want to talk for a couple of minutes about this , because this strikes me as a huge deal , not just for Netflix , for the internet as a whole .
so Hannah &apos;s artisanal work , and the fact that she shared her findings , opens the doors to a series of new possibilities that are both aesthe@@ tically appealing and innovative .
if they had some extra bandwidth , they would deliver a message for you .
my rough calculation is it would be about 25 miles thick .
and so there &apos;s a lot of -- I &apos;m sure you &apos;ve read a lot in papers , about worries about cyberattacks and defenses against those .
but I only thought that I would be separated from my family for a short time .
em : there actually are far more charging stations than people realize , and at Tesla we developed something called a Super@@ charging technology , and we &apos;re offering that if you buy a Model S for free , forever .
what &apos;s unusual about that ?
and the thing about solar power is that it doesn &apos;t have any feed stock or operational costs , so once it &apos;s installed , it &apos;s just there .
CA : so that seems like a win for the consumer .
you &apos;ve never seen this before . a rocket blasting off and then -- EM : yeah , so that rocket is about the size of a 12-@@ story building .
you bet your fortune on it , and you seem to have done that multiple times .
it &apos;s exciting to see that in terms of what we &apos;ve learned , but how many of those 4,000 diseases now have treatments available ?
cystic fibrosis had its molecular cause discovered in 1989 by my group working with another group in Toronto , discovering what the mutation was in a particular gene on chromosome 7 .
well , one way to go faster is to take advantage of technology , and a very important technology that we depend on for all of this is the human genome , the ability to be able to look at a chromosome , to un@@ zip it , to pull out all the DNA , and to be able to then read out the letters in that DNA code , the A &apos;s , C &apos;s , G &apos;s and T &apos;s that are our instruction book and the instruction book for all living things , and the cost of doing this , which used to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars , has in the course of the last 10 years fallen faster than Moore &apos;s Law , down to the point where it is less than 10,000 dollars today to have your genome sequenced , or mine , and we &apos;re headed for the $ 1,000 genome fairly soon .
for me , at NIH now for almost 20 years , there has never been a time where there was more excitement about the potential that lies in front of us .
we have made all these discoveries pouring out of laboratories across the world .
( music ) And when I was speaking to Chris about the future of Virtual Choir and where we might be able to take this , he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could .
and that is exactly what we found .
and I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
as you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box . I call it a trans@@ former .
and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
RT : but I know electric fences are already invented , but I want to make mine .
and so right afterwards , I met backstage with Al , and with Lawrence Ben@@ der , who was there , and Lau@@ rie David , and Davis Gu@@ g@@ gen@@ heim , who was running documentaries for P@@ arti@@ cip@@ ant at the time .
we now call Al the George Clo@@ oney of global warming .
I &apos;ll quickly talk about a few coming up .
so imagine how something like this could help revolutionize your field of work .
okay , here &apos;s two theories about how people might think about this , and then we &apos;ll see some data .
there &apos;s another group of people who seem to have a firm grip on equilibrium analysis , because they &apos;re picking zero or one .
first some behavior . so a bunch of the subject pairs , they play face to face .
finally , we changed the pay@@ offs one more time .
now , there &apos;s good news and bad news about this corruption .
it blocks the right too , as it makes princi@@ pled arguments of the right increasingly impossible .
and to do this does not require a constitutional amendment , changing the First Amendment .
this is a solvable issue .
well , what I concluded from reviewing all these cases is that it is important that this happens only when death is instant and in a dramatic way and in the right position for cop@@ ulation .
the only thing this bird did was fly against this window from 2004 to 2008 , day in and day out .
it &apos;s really maneuverable . you have a hand-@@ held remote , so you can pretty easily control acceleration , braking , go in reverse if you like , also have braking .
here &apos;s ten seconds of data .
they &apos;re a great group .
and the week before I showed up , the CEO of this big software company went to that group , 200 engineers , and canceled the project .
because in reality , it was even ugli@@ er than the first version .
( Laughter ) But imagine this was slightly different .
and we &apos;re dedicated to trying to develop programmable materials for the built environment .
and it &apos;s getting very close to what they call the winner &apos;s cloud .
Watson does not travel .
the things we know are still important .
these are the decisions that require correct judgments about many different kinds of facts .
her parents thought about it , and they finally , to their credit , decided to believe her .
I have always believed that the things we know -- that knowledge is an absolute good , that the things we have learned and carry with us in our heads are what make us who we are , as individuals and as a species .
I don &apos;t want to be the last trivia know-@@ it-@@ all sitting on a mountain somewhere , rec@@ iting to himself the state capitals and the names of &quot; Simp@@ sons &quot; episodes and the lyrics of Ab@@ ba songs .
so just by a show of hands , how many of you all have a robot at home ?
I &apos;ve always wanted a picture of a 1,@@ 500-@@ person TED audience .
so I can go in and I can say let &apos;s make Romo excited .
the reason we &apos;re so focused on building robots that everyone can train is that we think the most compelling use cases in personal robotics are personal .
so I wish that I could tell you what the future of personal robotics looks like .
because I &apos;m used to doing Q &amp; amp ; As .
we believe that the blast was right outside the gate of Ta@@ ji , we &apos;re heading to that location now .
soldier : I &apos;ll walk you through it .
this is the scene north .
and they came into my room the next morning .
and the real question is , what lessons did we learn ?
and so we had black and white students and others who began to attend .
and the question is this : how is it that now we lead the country in producing African-Americans who go on to complete Ph.D. &apos; s in science and engineering and M@@ .D. / Ph.D. &apos; s ?
interestingly enough , an example : one young man who earned a C in the first course and wanted to go on to med school , we said , &quot; We need to have you re@@ take the course , because you need a strong foundation if you &apos;re going to move to the next level . &quot;
you all know that so often in science and engineering we tend to think cut@@ throat .
most important , if a student has a sense of self , it is amazing how the dreams and the values can make all the difference in the world .
it represents the wi@@ sest option among many alternatives . &quot;
three different specialists had prescribed three different versions of the same drug to me .
out of all the care I &apos;ve had in hospitals and clinics around the world , the first time I &apos;ve ever had a true team@@ -based care experience was at Leg@@ acy Good Sam these last six months for me to go get this .
and I &apos;m going to tell you today about four major changes to science these men made .
these grants not only allowed less wealthy men to conduct research , but they also encouraged thinking outside the box , rather than just trying to solve one pre-@@ set question .
but then you look at that already minuscule water and sanitation budget , and 75 to 90 percent of it will go on clean water supply , which is great ; we all need water .
( Laughter ) And in case you think that poster &apos;s just propaganda , here &apos;s Pri@@ yan@@ ka , 23 years old .
so this woman , this boy &apos;s mother installed this latrine in a few hours .
so when I get sad about sanitation , I think of Japan , because Japan 70 years ago was a nation of people who used pit lat@@ r@@ ines and wiped with sticks , and now it &apos;s a nation of what are called W@@ os@@ hu@@ ret@@ tos , wash@@ let toilets .
it &apos;s a little different than the way we think about brain disorders like Huntington &apos;s or Parkinson &apos;s or Alzheimer &apos;s disease where you have a bom@@ be@@ d-out part of your cortex .
that &apos;s something we can observe .
if we waited until the heart attack , we would be sacrificing 1.1 million lives every year in this country to heart disease .
I &apos;d grown five inches and done some 20,000 pus@@ hu@@ ps in eight months , and the night before the crash , I delighted in my new body , playing basketball with friends into the wee hours of a May morning .
I decided to find Abed , and when I finally did , he responded to my Hebrew hello which such non@@ chal@@ ance , it seemed he &apos;d been awaiting my phone call .
I wished to tell him that not only paraly@@ zers and paraly@@ z@@ ees must evolve , reconcile to reality , but we all must -- the aging and the anxious and the divorced and the bal@@ ding and the bankrupt and everyone .
but most of all , I wished to tell him what Herman Mel@@ ville wrote , that &quot; truly to enjoy bodily warmth , some small part of you must be cold , for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast . &quot;
( Applause ) Thanks a lot .
I was so excited .
so we wondered , can we place electrodes in this area of sadness and see if we can turn down the thermostat , can we turn down the activity , and what will be the consequence of that ?
we &apos;re going to place electrodes within the circuits that regulate your memory and cognitive function to see if we can turn up their activity .
we &apos;re going to do this in people that have cognitive deficits , and we &apos;ve chosen to treat patients with Alzheimer &apos;s disease who have cognitive and memory deficits .
writing is something that came along much later , and as we saw in the last talk , there &apos;s a little bit of controversy as to exactly when that happened , but according to traditional estimates , if humanity had existed for 24 hours , then writing only came along at about 11 : 0@@ 7 p@@ .@@ m .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing in this finger@@ ed speech .
well , the fact of the matter is , look at this person in 1956 , and this is when texting doesn &apos;t exist , &quot; I Love Lucy &quot; is still on the air .
it doesn &apos;t have air conditioning .
now here &apos;s eight centuries of economic growth .
( Laughter ) So , I looked for a different show to watch .
but in reality , the sky looked like this . it was a beautiful , complex sky .
people ask me how they make the antenna .
Thank you .
interpreter : by making myself invisible , I try to explore and question the contradictory and often inter-@@ canc@@ eling relationship between our civilization and its development .
one is about the war in the Middle East , and another one is about a public demonstration in France .
look down that infinite reflection , and it will get di@@ mmer , because some light is lost or absorbed every time , but it will also become greener , because green light , that is light of a wavelength that we perceive as green , is best reflected by most mirrors .
and I thought , &quot; Holy crap , he said &apos; Yes . &apos; &quot; and then he said , &quot; At that point , I was so brainwashed , I wasn &apos;t taking in any contradictory information .
and we wanted to see if technology could change that .
online abuse has been this perverse art of figuring out what makes people angry , what makes people afraid , what makes people insecure , and then pushing those pressure points until they &apos;re silenced .
the opposite happens when you extend your ankle .
it feels like they &apos;re stuck inside rigid ski boots .
then , after my limbs were amputated , I suddenly became an MIT professor .
in this 21st century , designers will extend the nervous system into powerfully strong exoskele@@ tons that humans can control and feel with their minds .
PC : your pupil doesn &apos;t lie .
changing the music and the sound effects completely alter the emotional impact of that scene .
I was a young driver out on the highway , and the car in front of me , I saw the brake lights go on .
okay , so that &apos;s all you have , eyes that weren &apos;t really designed for this task , but then people ask you to do things like , you want to make a lane change , what &apos;s the first thing they ask you do ?
even if , when you &apos;re in your car and some motor@@ cyclist comes -- b@@ sho@@ om ! -- 85 miles an hour down , lan@@ e-@@ splitting -- I know you &apos;ve had this experience -- that guy didn &apos;t &quot; just come out of nowhere . &quot;
but a doctor that studies how vultures eat dead things is probably not the type of doctor my parents had in mind .
therefore , the goal is to get forensic scientists to focus on vulture evidence and to get law enforcement to consider vulture scavenging and a possible recent death when skeletal remains are found .
so today I &apos;m going to tell you ten things that you thought everybody knew , but it turns out they don &apos;t .
hold down the Shi@@ ft key to scroll back up again .
type the name of the airline and the flight .
much more precise .
Thank you .
carbon-free electricity .
you ever thought about that ?
I have things to do , people to impress , and places to go . &quot;
we can do this . we &apos;re educators .
you must stop . stop .
this farm that had thousands of head of cattle had just a few hundreds , and we didn &apos;t know how to deal with these .
that is the essence of our life , these forests .
we are doing the sequest@@ ration of about 100,000 tons of carbon with these trees .
what if you &apos;re only going to be anonymous for 15 minutes ? ( Laughter ) Well , then , because of electronic tattoos , maybe all of you and all of us are very close to immortality , because these tattoos will live far longer than our bodies will .
the interesting thing , the original thing , would be to threaten somebody with immortality .
it &apos;s not like a bottle of wine .
what kind of business model is that ?
here &apos;s what we know .
we didn &apos;t know how critical those first three years were .
you know , people tell me , &quot; Yeah , those charter schools , a lot of them don &apos;t work . &quot;
they &apos;re like , &quot; I really can &apos;t come back . &quot; no . you &apos;d better stay in school .
I gave out homework assignments .
we studied ro@@ o@@ kie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods , asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year , and of those , who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students ?
I had a kid one day come into my class having been stabbed the night before .
and the trouble with that objection , it reflects a total misunderstanding of how much local economies involve everyone being interdependent .
even if everyone at my firm has good skills , if the workers at the suppliers to my firm do not have good skills , my firm is going to be less competitive competing in national and international markets .
and that &apos;s something that each and every citizen and voter needs to ask themselves .
class sizes are smaller than in many countries .
if you &apos;ve got two children or more , I bet you they are completely different from each other .
but they should not be the dominant culture of education .
( Laughter ) And sit staring out the window with a bottle of Jack Dani@@ els .
I mean , there &apos;s a bit , but it &apos;s not what gets people up in the morning , what keeps them at their desks .
( Laughter ) Really . really .
you have to put it back to the people .
and they work .
there &apos;s a wonderful quote from Benjamin Franklin .
&quot; do you learn to correct your mistakes ? &quot;
at the beginning of class , I just per@@ ch it in the back of the classroom . it &apos;s not a perfect shot .
a very , very beautiful object .
so basically , if you wanted to generalize , you can demonstrate that as the density increases along the bottom there , that the energy consumed reduces dramatically .
so if you cross the border -- just across the border -- a small factory in Germany , and here you can see the guy with his computer screen , and those points in space are communicated .
and on the left are the cutting machines , which then , in the factory , enable those individual pieces to be fabricated and plus or minus very , very few millimeters , to be sl@@ ot@@ ted together on site .
this is the view you would get , if you looked down on that .
and if you just go back to the previous image , and you look at this area of volatility and hostility , that a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture could have the affect of bringing all those war@@ ring factions together in a united cause , in terms of something that would be genuinely green and productive in the wi@@ dest sense .
( Laughter ) And I got a twenty@@ something who wanted to talk about boys .
that was the moment I realized , 30 is not the new 20 .
that was when I realized that this sort of benign neglect was a real problem , and it had real consequences , not just for Alex and her love life but for the careers and the families and the futures of twentysomethings everywhere .
we &apos;re talking about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent if you consider that no one &apos;s getting through adulthood without going through their 20s first .
and then it starts to sound like this : &quot; dating in my 20s was like musical chairs .
the best time to work on your marriage is before you have one , and that means being as intentional with love as you are with work .
what if technologies could intervene to disrupt the balance of certain kinds of relationships ?
so jogging those zones of familiarity is one way to think about strangeness , and it &apos;s a problem faced not just by individuals today , but also by organizations , organizations that are trying to embrace massively new opportunities .
and I started in nature , because I saw these Gu@@ ay@@ m@@ í@@ s doing it in nature , and there just seems to be less barriers .
here &apos;s a triangle that was being formed underneath a flowing stream , and the shape of an oak leaf being made by other small oak leaves being put together .

I &apos;ve put work@@ sheets online , so if you &apos;d like , you can plan your own end .
possibly research could help us not only to predict the path of asteroids that might collide with us , but actually to deflect them .
you never get off , and you never really feel satisfied .
it enables you to have a solid basis for self-esteem on which you can feel your life was really worth living .
that started a kidney chain which enabled four people to receive kidneys . &quot;
and all of those booms , in their own various ways , have now kicked the bucket , and we &apos;re back in this situation where the smartest designers and architects in the world are only really able to work for one percent of the population .
they &apos;re self-@@ made cities in one form or another .
to my surprise , it did not correlate .
so he figured that out . it took him over two minutes to figure out that he was doing things to the television .
and they said , &quot; Well , we &apos;ve picked it up from the CDs . &quot;
this is the Himalayas . up in the north , very cold .
this sequence is also nice . this is a small child , a six-year-old , telling his eldest sister what to do .
so if they have access to the computer , they will teach themselves , including intelligence .
so here was the power of what a group of children can do , if you lift the adult intervention .
around these four are usually a group of about 16 children , who are also advising , usually wrongly , about everything that &apos;s going on on the computer .
it was that primary education can happen on its own , or parts of it can happen on its own .
now , with my last piece , I &apos;d like to show you that classical music can be so much fun , exciting , and that it can rock you .
and then , again , as climate changed as it always does , and new habitats opened up , we had the arrival of a step@@ pe-@@ adapted species called tro@@ gon@@ ther@@ i@@ i in Central Asia pushing mer@@ idi@@ on@@ al@@ is out into Western Europe .
like 99 percent of all the animals that have once lived , they go extinct , likely due to a warming climate and fast-@@ encro@@ aching dense forests that are migrating north , and also , as the late , great Paul Martin once put it , probably Ple@@ i@@ sto@@ cene over@@ kill , so the large game hunters that took them down .
and you know , the amount of work -- yeah , Alex@@ ey Pa@@ jit@@ no@@ v was working for the Soviet government and that &apos;s how he developed Te@@ tr@@ is , and Alex@@ ey himself reconstructed the whole game and even gave us a simulation of the ca@@ tho@@ de ray tube that makes it look slightly bombed .
so I let people understand that it &apos;s up to them to know how to judge interaction so as to know when it &apos;s good or when it &apos;s bad .
I &apos;m sure that all of you know Kat@@ am@@ ari Dam@@ acy .
dwarf Fort@@ re@@ ss is like the holy gra@@ il of this kind of massive multiplayer online game , and in fact the two Adams brothers were in Rey@@ k@@ j@@ av@@ í@@ k , and they were greeted by a standing ov@@ ation by all the Eve Online fans .
we have Street F@@ igh@@ ter II , because martial arts are good .
and right now , we started with the first 14 , but we have several that are coming up , and the reason why we haven &apos;t acquired them yet is because you don &apos;t acquire just the game .
designers that deal with interaction design behaviors that go to influence the rest of our lives .
design is truly everywhere , and design is as important as anything , and I &apos;m so glad that , because of its diversity and because of its centr@@ ality to our lives , many more people are coming to it as a profession , as a passion , and as , very simply , part of their own culture .
it should be on adult men with power .
this week ? last week ?
but this story is much more than about household energy use .
tell me . what should I do to save energy ? &quot;
compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic .

she was facing the question of what to do with this child .
and Sue looked at the floor , and she thought for a minute .
if you have extreme diseases , you need to get extreme remedies .
now , it &apos;s important to remember that you &apos;re only hearing the human-@@ audible parts of dolphin sounds , and dolphins make ultras@@ onic sounds , and we use special equipment in the water to collect these sounds .
so just take a guess in your mind which one is the dolphin .
they could point at the visual object , or they could mimic the whistle .
and we &apos;re at prototype stage , but this is how we hope it will play out .
( Applause )
Reu@@ ther &apos;s problem in that anecdote is that it is tough to offer your labor to an economy that &apos;s full of machines , and we see this very clearly in the statistics .
but the middle class is clearly under huge threat right now .
now , that &apos;s probably making some folk in this room uncomfortable , because that idea is associated with the extreme left wing and with fairly radical schemes for re@@ distributing wealth .
the company did not succeed , and he couldn &apos;t pay the money back , and I was the guaran@@ tor of the note . so , I had a $ 100,000 debt , and I noticed that the Kra@@ mer prize for human-@@ powered flight , which had then been around for -- ( Laughter ) -- 17 years at the time , was 50,000 pounds , which , at the exchange rate , was just about 100,000 dollars .
approaching a peak radar altitude of 9@@ 6,@@ 8@@ 63 feet , at 4 : 12 p.m. , He@@ li@@ os is standing on top of 98 percent of the Earth &apos;s atmosphere .
so he became like a renaissance man , and here &apos;s what it looks like in the movie .
they are objects of desire .
actually , I knew what these things would look like in my mind for many , many years .
and what are you going to do about it ?
and it can &apos;t result in healthy sexuality developing in young people or in adults .
you do . I do .
she decided she really liked robots .
this is the percentage of adults who are working age .
and I don &apos;t mean robots in terms of companions .
we can also augment the model to include where we want the quad to be in space .
or do they ?
we now have a natural way of interacting with the raw athle@@ ticism of these quads with my gestures .
take this quad , for example .
as time goes on , gravity will be increased until we &apos;re all back on planet Earth , but I assure you we won &apos;t get there .
what followed were the most difficult decisions in my life , painful to me , painful to my country@@ men , imposing cuts , austerity , often on those not to blame for the crisis .
representative government began to form .
but I think the truth is the exact opposite .
so this time I asked my brother to come with me and drive by a police car .
we started a hashtag on Twitter mo@@ cking the study , and it made headlines around the world .
just to tell you , two stories happened in the last two years .
at the same time , I flew back to my home country , they hated that speech so much .
ninety percent said yes , she &apos;s a tra@@ itor .
again , many interesting stories for each of them .
you know , they had made billions just surfing this bubble until now .
they told me , &quot; Di@@ dier , yeah , the market might be over@@ valued , but you forget something .
the idea is the following . we monitor the markets .
we do our work . we write a report in which we put our prediction of the critical time .
eighty percent of what walked in the door , in terms of illness , was infectious disease -- third world , developing world infectious disease , caused by a poor living environment .
you can &apos;t breathe as well .
that work continues for six to 12 months , until all the houses are improved and we &apos;ve spent our budget of 7,500 dollars total per house .
and for a whole house , the nine healthy living practices , we test , check and fix 250 items in every house .
he could give school kids in this community the beautiful fly trap you see above in the slide .
it is man-made and can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings . &quot;
it &apos;s almost like a reflex .
this is the revolutionary new tool that &apos;s taking neuroscience by storm , and in this case , &quot; op@@ to &quot; means light and &quot; genetic &quot; refers to the fact that these fruit flies have been modified to contain a special gene that makes only certain neurons respond to light .
opto@@ genetics means that we can control these special neurons whenever they &apos;re exposed to a bri@@ ght-@@ colored light , causing them to send messages to the brain .
GG : so you &apos;re going to suck those out .
and with desertification , sand@@ storms , the G@@ obi Desert , the O@@ gad@@ en , we are finding increasing difficulty of a hectare to produce as many calories as it did even 15 years ago .
can you imagine ? ( Laughter ) We &apos;re seeing an ent@@ ente cor@@ di@@ ale between science and religion that five years ago I would not have believed , as the evangelical community has understood the desperate situation of global warming .
I have not seen my mom or my sister since then .
when I could not fall asleep from bitter cold or hunger pains , I hoped that , the next morning , my sister would come back to wake me up with my favorite food .
I realized I couldn &apos;t survive much longer this way .
but in America , I didn &apos;t know what to do , because I had this overwhelming freedom .
still , some boundaries are larger than others .
and the recurrent theme that I encounter all the time is people say , &quot; Well , you know , the people who do see , they &apos;re whistleblowers , and we all know what happens to them . &quot;
and the other thing that people often say about whistleblowers is , &quot; Well , there &apos;s no point , because you see what happens to them .
combined with the data on effort , we have been able to map the revenue of fishing the high seas .
but there are two more factors we have to take into account .
as we speak , negoti@@ ators at the United Nations are beginning discussions on a new agreement to do just that .
this is called fuel parti@@ tioning in the lin@@ go .
nobody is ever satisfied 100 percent with humor except this woman .
now , we could fit more cartoons in the magazine if we removed the articles .
there &apos;s an incon@@ gru@@ ity and a contrast .
it &apos;s a space that is playful in its own way , and also purposeful , and in that space , the cartoons are different .
and so The New Yorker is also trying to , in some way , make cartoons say something besides funny and something about us . here &apos;s another one .
we understand that . it &apos;s absurd . but we &apos;re putting the two together .
in the case of the thylacine , regre@@ tt@@ ably , we shot every one that we saw .
I called up my friend , Professor Mike Tyler in the University of Ad@@ el@@ ai@@ de .
we used ultraviolet radiation to do that .
to add insult to injury , having swept this species nearly off the table , this animal , when it died of neglect -- The keepers didn &apos;t let it into the hu@@ tch on a cold night in Hob@@ art .
it &apos;s there . so we got it .
well , George Church , in his book , &quot; Re@@ genesis , &quot; has mentioned many of the techniques that are rapidly advancing to work with fragmented DNA .
some of the thylacines that were being turned in to zo@@ os , sanctu@@ aries , even at the museums , had collar marks on the neck .
communism !
now , this may be counterintuitive to you .
this is not a pu@@ t-@@ down of anyone . it &apos;s just a statement of fact .
today , it &apos;s the second largest economy in the world , an industrial powerhouse , and its people live in increasing prosperity .
but a more careful look would tell us otherwise .
one of the features of a democratic system is a space for civil society to express itself .
so you seem to suggest the Chinese model doesn &apos;t have a space outside of the Party for civil society to express itself .
we don &apos;t know -- and this is really amazing to me -- we don &apos;t know how many children were born -- or how many children there are -- in Bolivia or Botswana or Bhutan .
sometimes it takes months to even years to do something like this .
I had developed a process whereby I was the center of the universe of this technology .
we can take a process that took two years and compress that down to the space of five minutes .
what happened after we did this ?
the turnaround time between a teacher writing down grades or attendance and getting that into a report was about two to three years .
and in those 50 years , not only did we literally , physically set foot on the moon , but we have disp@@ at@@ ched robotic spacecraft to all the planets -- all eight of them -- and we have landed on asteroids , we have ren@@ de@@ zv@@ ous@@ ed with comets , and , at this point in time , we have a spacecraft on its way to Pluto , the body formerly known as a planet .
and it was a sho@@ cker , because it was everything we wanted those other pictures taken from orbit to be .
so again , it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid , until finally , we saw lakes in the polar regions .
now , there is something deeply moving about seeing ourselves from afar , and capturing the sight of our little , blue-@@ ocean planet in the skies of other worlds .
and when there &apos;s bad news in store , there &apos;s a cloud on the horizon .
but I think they &apos;re beautiful , don &apos;t you ?
rarer still , the Kel@@ v@@ in-@@ Hel@@ m@@ hol@@ tz cloud .
it &apos;s an antidote to the growing tendency we have to feel that we can really ever experience life by watching it on a computer screen , you know , when we &apos;re in a wi@@ -fi zone .
I &apos;m sure many of us have had the experience of buying and returning items online .
it &apos;s true that some humans eat better than others .
as you can see , they meet in 2030 , I &apos;ll be retired by then .
in other words , as I already said , I have invented nothing .
now , it was then much later traded on with the kind assistance of the Nigerian government -- now I have to be careful what I say here - to subsi@@ di@@ aries of S@@ hell and the Italian En@@ i , two of the biggest oil companies around .
that &apos;s almost twice the country &apos;s annual health and education budget combined .
when Scotland lo@@ omed before him , he made out the figure of Benandonner from afar .
but the challenge is , as we move to cities , cities are built in these two materials , steel and concrete , and they &apos;re great materials .
they &apos;re changing the scale of what we can do , and what we &apos;ve developed is something we call F@@ F@@ TT , which is a Creative Commons solution to building a very flexible system of building with these large panels where we tilt up six stories at a time if we want to .
I think of the earliest life as &quot; Life 1.@@ 0 &quot; because it was really dumb , like bacteria , unable to learn anything during its lifetime .
one option is to be complacent .
( Applause ) Alright , now raise your hand if your computer has ever crashed .
it could not only eliminate negative experiences like disease , poverty , crime and other suffering , but it could also give us the freedom to choose from a fantastic new diversity of positive experiences -- basically making us the masters of our own destiny .
we &apos;re all here to celebrate the age of amazement , and I feel that its essence should lie in becoming not over@@ powered but empowered by our technology .
Peter Gabriel : I make noises for a living .
so I started cold-@@ calling , and eventually got through to Sue Sav@@ age-@@ Ru@@ mb@@ au@@ gh , and she invited me down .
so if we could switch to the audio from this computer , we &apos;ve been video confer@@ encing with cognitive animals , and we &apos;re going to have each of them just briefly introduce them .
but it leads to what is coming next .
what we very quickly discovered is that this was a system for connecting people together .
all right , well thank you all so much for joining us .
over 85 percent of all pancreatic cancers are diagnosed late , when someone has less than a two percent chance of survival .
but also , the key is that it &apos;s found in the earliest stages of the disease , when someone has close to 100 percent chance of survival .
so now that I &apos;d found a reliable protein I could detect , I then shifted my focus to actually detecting that protein , and thus , pancreatic cancer .
and the third is all of the sound that we humans generate that &apos;s called anthro@@ phony .
well , I was wrong . what I learned from these encounters was that careful listening gives us incredibly valuable tools by which to evaluate the health of a habitat across the entire spectrum of life .
this is an example of a spectro@@ gram .
so I got in my car , and I drove three hours north along the coast , and the roads grew emp@@ tier and narrower , and then I turned onto an even narrower path , barely paved , that sna@@ ked for two miles up to the top of a mountain .
I didn &apos;t consult the monks for guidance .
while many people responded in different ways about our education system , my response to the high-@@ pressure environment was making bows with pieces of wood found near my apartment building .
it &apos;s what brings that lightning .
maybe , like in London , where the number of music venues went from 400 in 2010 to 100 in 2015 , we need to think about protections against gentri@@ fication .
let &apos;s start with technology .
these are among the world &apos;s most admired , most beloved , most innovative companies .
it &apos;s one way of describing what happened with deregulation of the financial services in the U.S. and the U.K .
well , it &apos;s a personal why .
and I &apos;m going to try and show that at the end , and the suspense will be as much mine if it works .
why didn &apos;t you come here in the first place ? &quot;
it &apos;s just a collection of things that have been done before , but bringing them together in a different way .
so this one is like a sound board , so you can touch it , and I just love these horrible noises .
you can &apos;t do this if you don &apos;t give a definition .
and just as the jar full of water can go from liquid to solid depending on the behavior of the molecules , so your brain can go from a state of being conscious to a state of being unconscious , depending on the behavior of the molecules .
they said , obviously tried to dis@@ soci@@ ate themselves from drugs , but said , &quot; It reminds me of one thing and that &apos;s the value of the brand has stayed consistent . &quot; ( Laughter ) Which backs up my point and shows he didn &apos;t even break a sweat when he said that .
so the first day we get to New York , my grandmother and I find a penny in the floor of the homeless shelter that my family &apos;s staying in .
only , we don &apos;t know that it &apos;s a homeless shelter .
and my belief is that we will get more and more new materials which we can put into structure later on , because structure is one of the key issues in aircraft design .
so nature is very clever . it puts all the information into these small building blocks , which we call DNA .
you &apos;ll also hear it at the same intensity in each ear .
I was on Bow@@ man Lake in Glacier National Park , which is a long , skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it , and my partner and I have a rowing shell .
the plane you came in , cars , the seats that you &apos;re sitting on .
how does life make things ?
in our fuel cells , we do it with platinum ; life does it with a very , very common iron .
there &apos;s a company here in San Francisco called MR@@ 3 that is embedding mimics of the microbes &apos; molecules on filters to mine waste streams .
many people have harmed me in my life , and I remember them all , but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with the people who &apos;ve helped me .
I used to say that these people saved me , but what I now know is they did something even more important in that they empowered me to save myself , and crucially , they helped me to understand something which I &apos;d always suspected : that my voices were a meaningful response to traumatic life events , particularly childhood events , and as such were not my enemies but a source of insight into solvable emotional problems .
I remember , for example , sitting up one night on guard outside my parents &apos; room to protect them from what I thought was a genuine threat from the voices .
I &apos;ve got a plastic fork , don &apos;t you know ? &quot;
and I remember the most moving and extraordinary moment when supporting another young woman who was terror@@ ized by her voices , and becoming fully aware , for the very first time , that I no longer felt that way myself but was finally able to help someone else who was .
I &apos;m now very proud to be a part of Inter@@ voice , the organizational body of the International Hear@@ ing Voices Movement , an initiative inspired by the work of Professor Mari@@ us Rom@@ me and Dr. Sandra E@@ sch@@ er , which lo@@ cates voice hearing as a survival strategy , a sane reaction to insane circumstances , not as an ab@@ er@@ rant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured , but a complex , significant and meaningful experience to be explored .

and then we started looking at the data .
the lines on the bottom , the blue and the red , these are the interesting ones .
that &apos;s why they use it in production , they pay a lot of money to develop it .
if I say , &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence ( Arabic ) , &quot; what does this remind you of ?
we say@@ -- ( Applause ) We want to change our reality , and be convinced in a way that reflects our dreams , aspirations and day-to-day life .
something very easy , yet creative and persuasive .
when my daughter is born , I &apos;ll tell her , &quot; This is your father , honey ( Arabic ) . &quot;
and in the supermarket , I promise my daughter Noor , that if she says to me , &quot; Thanks ( Arabic ) , &quot; I won &apos;t say , &quot; D@@ is , &apos; Mer@@ ci , Ma@@ man , &apos; &quot; and hope no one has heard her .
for example , no one can do two notes at the same time .
you don &apos;t have to . it &apos;s fine . check it out .
I &apos;m going to lay down a bass sound now .
and I &apos;m not just an academic , I &apos;m a philosopher , so I like to think that I &apos;m actually pretty good at arguing .
but the orchestra were wo@@ wed as well , and the press of the world were fascinated by your ability to play these fantastic pieces .

( music ) ( Applause ) The TED people will kill me , but perhaps there &apos;s time for one enc@@ ore .
so that was the goal of my design .
so during the summer with my students , we built over 50 units of the shelters .
this is what happened in Japan two years ago , in northern Japan .
so we went there to build parti@@ tions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes , just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain .
this is the single-celled organism we all came from .
RB : well , I like to think it stands for quality , that you know , if somebody comes across a Virgin company , they -- CA : they are quality , Richard . come on now , everyone says quality . spirit ?
we have a lot of fun and I think the people who work for it enjoy it .
( Laughter ) RB : it &apos;s a tough job , isn &apos;t it ?
RB : well , I knew I had about half an hour &apos;s fuel left , and I also knew that the chances were that if I jumped , I would only have a couple of minutes of life left .
and it was one of the reasons I left school when I was 15 years old .
CA : no , trust me , it &apos;s gross .
did this really happen ?
do you look at the current generation of kids coming up and think they &apos;re too co@@ ddled , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;ve got , we &apos;re going to raise a generation of privileged ...
it &apos;s not even an upgrade from economy to first class .
but my friends , it &apos;s so much worse than that .
they have a biological predisposition to go to bed late and get up late , so give them a break .
we need eight hours of sleep a night .
( Laughter ) &quot; It &apos;d be like putting a piece of toast through a basketball hoop , wouldn &apos;t it ? &quot;
today we &apos;re going to talk about prime numbers .

( Applause ) B@@ MA has supported charities and volunteers who have helped reshape Lebanon , raising funds for their causes and encouraging others to give .
Chan@@ ge-@@ makers and future leaders have been created .
as simple as that .
XL : Oh . that &apos;s true . so it looks like , hmm , indeed we need to find a better way to impact the brain at the speed of light .
now to do that , first we need to trick brain cells to respond to laser beams .
( Laughter ) So after the experiment , the two of us just left the room without saying anything .
XL : so all memory is sophisticated and dynamic , but if just for simplicity , let &apos;s imagine memory as a movie clip .
it just would erase my brush strokes like invisible ink .
in the past year , I want you to just raise your hand if you &apos;ve experienced relatively little stress .
and then they used public death records to find out who died .
and when oxytocin is released in the stress response , it is motivating you to seek support .
it also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress .
there &apos;s another one which suggests that 30 million hectares of land in Europe , an area the size of Poland , will be vac@@ ated by farmers between 2000 and 2030 .
it was related to the Asian elephant , but it was a temperate animal , a temperate forest creature .
JB : and you move from there into that open , ca@@ vern@@ ous space .
Mrs. Lo@@ is Do@@ ery , whom I later came to call my surrogate mum , read me many thousands of hours onto tape .
of course , talking books for the blind pre@@ dated all this technology .
I &apos;ve indeed been a very fortunate human being .
I &apos;d like to thank my researcher Hannah Martin , who is my slide clicker , who clicks the slides , and my wife , Professor Mary C@@ rock , who &apos;s the light of my life , is coming on to collect me .
that &apos;s when Jes@@ uit missionaries in Peru discovered the bark of the cin@@ ch@@ ona tree , and inside that bark was qu@@ in@@ ine , still an effective cure for malaria to this day .
we kind of create places that they love to live just by living our own lives .
and attacking the malarious way of life , it &apos;s not fast , it &apos;s not cheap , it &apos;s not easy , but I think it &apos;s the only lasting way forward .
but the painting reflects -- I don &apos;t think differently for children than I do for adults .
and Rick and I were on our way to a party in the Bronx , and somebody said Bron@@ xi@@ stan , and somebody said Fer@@ r@@ eri@@ stan , and we came up with this New Yorker cover , which we were able to -- we didn &apos;t know what we were doing .
and it really became the -- I don &apos;t know , you know , it was one of those moments people started laughing at what was going on .
( music ) OK . I taped my -- my aunt used to swim in the ocean every day of the year until she was about 85 .
turns out that &apos;s not cool .
for example , this testing platform , which enables the cybercriminals to test the quality of their viruses before they release them on the world .
and it &apos;s got a comments section here where we can submit comments to the website .
would someone be able to abuse it ? &quot;
now that you &apos;re done , close them down .
with your eyes closed , what am I wearing ?
we &apos;re just shopping .
yeah , funny . we &apos;ve got a little guy . he &apos;s union , works up there all day .
but this is very important for delicate environments , such as coral reefs .
and this robot is particular , because using air pressure , it grows from the tip , while the rest of the body stays in firm contact with the environment .
you have a light , because usually , you don &apos;t have too many lights inside your body .
so there &apos;s other , maybe more personal reasons , to care about bees .
and more recently , we &apos;ve been studying re@@ sins that bees collect from plants .
so what &apos;s going on ?
the bottom line is , bees dying reflects a flo@@ wer@@ less landscape and a dysfunctional food system .
and they &apos;re truc@@ ked in in semi-@@ loads , and they must be truc@@ ked out , because after bloom , the al@@ mond or@@ char@@ ds are a vast and flo@@ wer@@ less landscape .
and we need to diversify our farms .
so let the small act of planting flowers and keeping them free of pesticides be the driver of large-scale change .
when someone first suggested this to me , quite frankly I thought they were a little crazy , but what I soon came to realize was that this is not so crazy after all .
in the developed world , it &apos;s about 78 percent .
I say we are an urban animal .
and the squ@@ abble went on and on , and Kol@@ le@@ k listened and listened , and he finally said , &quot; G@@ ent@@ le@@ men , spare me your sermons , and I will fix your sewers . &quot;
Bor@@ is Johnson in London calls himself an an@@ ar@@ cho@@ -@@ T@@ ory .
I published an expos@@ é on the case , and a little while later , the accusing daughter filed a lawsuit .
Thank you . Thank you .
so I don &apos;t mean stupidity , I don &apos;t mean a cal@@ low indifference to fact or reason or data .
so if you think of knowledge being this ever-@@ expanding ripple on a pond , the important thing to realize is that our ignorance , the circumference of this knowledge , also grows with knowledge .
I mean , that &apos;s remarkable to me , clearly the best chemical detector on the face of the planet .
or are we on the verge of all being gifted ?
when I came home in 1955 from university at the time of Martin Luther King , a lot of people came home at that time and started having arguments with their parents and grandparents .
my father was born in 18@@ 85 , and he was mildly racially biased .
just as a triangle is half of a square , a semic@@ ir@@ cle is half of a circle .
they don &apos;t know who was an ally of America in World War II .
the rest of us are in between , and by the way , the average person in the street is almost exactly mid@@ way .
trustworthiness is what we have to judge .
there are many ways of casting molecular spells using DNA .
and to be totally honest , that &apos;s hard for me to stand up here and say .
I feared my truth , I feared my honesty , I feared my vulnerability , and that fear made me feel like I was forced into a corner , like I was forced into a corner and there was only one way out , and so I thought about that way every single day .
so we need to stop the ignorance , stop the intolerance , stop the stigma , and stop the silence , and we need to take away the taboos , take a look at the truth , and start talking , because the only way we &apos;re going to beat a problem that people are battling alone is by standing strong together , by standing strong together .
it &apos;s said in Tor@@ a@@ ja that everybody has sort of a predetermined amount of life .
but I know that my husband &apos;s family looks forward to the moment when they can rit@@ ually display what his remarkable presence has meant to their lives , when they can rit@@ ually re@@ count his life &apos;s narrative , weaving his story into the history of their community .
in fact , in Judaism , there were match@@ makers a long time ago , and though they didn &apos;t have an explicit algorithm per se , they definitely were running through formulas in their heads , like , is the girl going to like the boy ?
I &apos;m going to keep using these online dating sites , but I &apos;m going to treat them as databases , and rather than waiting for an algorithm to set me up , I think I &apos;m going to try reverse-@@ engineering this entire system .
I took a speaker , I placed a thin foil of plastic on top of that speaker , and then I added tiny little crystals on top of that speaker .
this is due to the attraction and the re@@ pulsion of the individual particles inside the liquid .
why did they go ? the cynical answer is they went because President Kennedy wanted to show the Soviets that his nation had the better rockets .
so &quot; Something happened to our capacity to solve big problems with technology &quot; has become a commonplace .
the Apollo mission , which has become a kind of metaphor for technology &apos;s capacity to solve big problems , met these criteria .
business is not seen as the solution .
it &apos;s meeting needs at a profit that leads to taxes and that leads to incomes and that leads to charitable donations .
it &apos;s real . it &apos;s happening .
we &apos;re now seeing companies embrace this idea .
the design of this street is really to maximize the movement of cars moving as quickly as possible from point A to point B , and it misses all the other ways that a street is used .
so if you &apos;ve got a big , controversial project , think about lawn chairs .
the bikes are being used six times a day .
quite radical .
you can still recognize them from their voice and say , &quot; Oh yeah , that &apos;s Joe , &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?
well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in front of a screen , and measure your galvan@@ ic skin response , and show pictures on the screen , I can measure how you sweat when you see an object , like a table or an umbrella . of course , you don &apos;t sweat .
when he sees her in person , he says it &apos;s an impostor .
these are very compelling , vivid sensations .
when I looked at the case sheet , I found that they had an actual arm , and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut , and the actual arm had been paralyzed , and lying in a sling for several months before the amputation , and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself .
secondly , synesthesia is about -- and this is what gets me to my point about the main theme of this lecture , which is about creativity -- synesthesia is eight times more common among artists , poets , novelists and other creative people than in the general population .
remember I said it runs in families ?
so it was the spread of tuberculosis and the spread of cholera that I was responsible for inhi@@ biting .
malaria had been stuck .
this reminded me of clustering that we &apos;d seen also in infectious epidemics , for example cholera .
in this case , it &apos;s someone who &apos;s very angry because someone looked at his girlfriend or owes him money , and you can find workers and train them into these specialized categories .
and I want to talk through some examples today of things that people have done that I think are really fascinating using flexible identity and anonymity on the web and blur@@ ring the lines between fact and fiction .
but I want to start and go back to the 1930s .
and that &apos;s something that this medium enabled , was experimentation being a part of the format itself .
Thank you .
&quot; give me liberty or give me death &quot; is all well and good if you can afford it , but if you &apos;re living on less than one dollar a day , you &apos;re far too busy trying to survive and to provide for your family than to spend your time going around trying to proclaim and defend democracy .
in fact , there are groups who would argue that they still do not have equal rights under the law .
is being more sustain@@ ble what gives you a higher quality of life ?
take , for example , this beautiful blue n@@ acre shell .
just over three years ago , I was for the first time in Car@@ ac@@ as , Venezuela , and while flying over the city , I was just amazed by the extent to which the slums reach into every corner of the city , a place where nearly 70 percent of the population lives in slums , dr@@ aped literally all over the mountains .
what originally brought me to Makoko was this project from a friend of mine , K@@ un@@ l@@ é A@@ de@@ ye@@ mi , who recently finished building this three-@@ story floating school for the kids in Makoko .
another place I &apos;d like to share with you is the Z@@ ab@@ baleen in Cairo .
while these apartments that they built for themselves appear to lack any planning or formal grid , each family speci@@ alizing in a certain form of recycling means that the ground floor of each apartment is reserved for gar@@ b@@ age-related activities and the upper floor is dedicated to living space .
what &apos;s allowed in these disc@@ our@@ ses , it shouldn &apos;t be something that &apos;s left up to un@@ accountable systems .
he spoke six languages , he played 15 musical instruments , he was a licensed pilot , he had once been a San Francisco cable car operator , he was an expert in swine nutrition , dairy cattle , Di@@ xi@@ eland jazz , film no@@ ir , and we did travel the country , and the world , and we did have a lot of kids .
perhaps there &apos;s still hope ahead .
dying is seen as failing , and we had a heroic narrative for fighting together , but we didn &apos;t have a heroic narrative for letting go .
( Laughter ) HP : ( in Chinese ) ( Laughter ) YR : needless to say , I would like to apologize to any Mandarin speakers in the audience .
YR : this phrase is now etched into my mind clearer than the pin number to my bank card , so I can pretend I speak Chinese fluently .
road density is six times greater in Asia than it is in rural Africa .
I think we &apos;re all in this room , probably , because we know that , in fact , Africa is the only region in the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go up over the next 10 years , where the food import bill is now double what it was 20 years ago , where food production per capita has stagn@@ ated , and where fertilizer use has declined rather than increased .
in our approach in Ethiopia , we &apos;ve decided to put together the entire ecosystem , or environment , in which trade takes place .
but first , let &apos;s think of customers .
take the topic of 100 percent targets , actually .
I mentioned renewable energy .
I think most of us would agree that in the 1990s , the greatest politician in the world was African , but I &apos;m meeting brilliant people across the continent the entire time , and they &apos;re doing the reforms which have transformed the economic situation for their countries .
and they &apos;re investing in energy .
if I look at Africa by population , East Africa stands out as so much potential .
now , I don &apos;t want to be an apo@@ logist for corruption .
if that &apos;s familiar , that &apos;s exactly what happened in sub-@@ Sahara in the &apos; 80s and the &apos; 90s .
the war-@@ loving Amazons , &quot; the equals of men &quot; in courage and skill , were familiar to everyone in ancient Greece .
their culture flourished for about 1,000 years beginning around 800 BC .
but as the Greeks began to trade around the Black Sea and further east , their portra@@ y@@ als became more realistic .
but recent archaeological discoveries have provided ample evidence .
it &apos;s so mysterious , and it &apos;s so pervasive .
I don &apos;t think so .
so the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets , putting all the entran@@ ces of the building .
with these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers because they were like , &quot; This is not a shopping mall . we didn &apos;t ask for that . &quot;
it &apos;s a bit too big , and it hasn &apos;t actually allowed these things like dynamic venture capital and commercialization to actually be able to really be as fru@@ it@@ ful as it could .
we all hope it might be something green , or all of this nanot@@ ech stuff , and in order for that stuff to happen , &quot; they say -- this was a special issue on the next industrial revolution -- they say , &quot; the state , just stick to the basics , right ?
fund the infrastructure . fund the schools .
it &apos;s actually been the one thinking out of the box .
we all know , if you &apos;ve ever taken a finance course , the first thing you &apos;re taught is sort of the risk-@@ reward relationship , and so some people are foolish enough or probably smart enough if they have time to wait , to actually invest in stocks , because they &apos;re higher risk which over time will make a greater reward than bonds , that whole risk-@@ reward thing .
well , where &apos;s the reward for the state of having taken on these massive risks and actually been foolish enough to have done the Internet ?
instead , many of the state budgets which in theory are trying to do that are being constrained .
I think there &apos;s nothing like a crisis to tell you what &apos;s really important and what &apos;s not , and Sandy made me realize that our devices and their connectivity matter to us right up there with food and shelter .
it needs months and years .
so I was filming .
the thing is , they see their lives and the risks they run decidedly differently .
and there is a kind of heroic resilience , a kind of pla@@ in-@@ spoken pragma@@ tism to those who start their day at 5 a.m .
here &apos;s a theory : could it be that those ties to ancestral soil , the soft variables reflected in their aphor@@ isms , actually affect longevity ?
I was about 10 years old on a camping trip with my dad in the Adi@@ ron@@ d@@ ack Mountains , a wilderness area in the northern part of New York State .
the cam@@ pers who were too lazy to take out what they had brought in , who did they think would clean up after them ?
everyone asks about the smell .
it must always be in motion .
you put on the uniform , and you become invisible until someone is upset with you for whatever reason like you &apos;ve blocked traffic with your truck , or you &apos;re taking a break too close to their home , or you &apos;re drinking coffee in their diner , and they will come and scor@@ n you , and tell you that they don &apos;t want you anywhere near them .
if they &apos;re not taking away trash efficiently and effectively every day , it starts to spill out of its contain@@ ments , and the dangers inherent to it threaten us in very real ways .
so I want to suggest today a couple of ways to think about sanitation that will perhaps help ame@@ li@@ or@@ ate the stigma and bring them into this conversation of how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane .
and their work lets us do our work .
as the mayor was preparing to deliver the speech starting the march , his team noticed that , while half of the participants were appropriately dressed in white , and bearing ban@@ ners asking for peace , the other half was actually marching in support of the criminal organization and its now-@@ presu@@ me@@ d-@@ de@@ fun@@ ct leader .
whether we like it or not , the U.S. is the largest market for illegal substances in the world , accounting for more than half of global demand .
the way they operate is that when they arrive in a locality , they let people know that they are there , and they go to the most powerful local gang and they say , &quot; I offer you to be the local representative of the Z@@ eta brand . &quot;
even today , there are over one billion people living in poor , rural communities around the world that do not have safe , year-round access to the things that you and I take for granted : education , medical care , access to markets ...
so the Pon@@ t Du G@@ ard in the center is a wonderful example -- Roman a@@ que@@ duct in the South of France -- fantastic piece of technology built using massive stones put together , dry -- there &apos;s no mortar in those joints .
and when they did emerge in the 1950s , they were an understandable over@@ reaction , this sort of over@@ safe response to what had happened .
it &apos;s a bit of a mouthful .
and I promise to you , this was such an important moment in my career , when I realized that the great leader believed in young people and new ideas .
and this was the idea : I &apos;m going to use a simplistic metaphor to explain to you this complicated concept .
here is my best physical therapist completely failing to encourage the rat to take a single step , whereas the same rat , five minutes earlier , walked beautifully on the treadmill .
we insisted . we refined our paradigm , and after several months of training , the otherwise paralyzed rat could stand , and whenever she decided , initiated full weigh@@ t-@@ bearing locomotion to sprint towards the rewards .
( Laughter ) We are right now seeing a much larger scale of tracking of individual citizens than he could have ever imagined .
you think about the largest IKEA store you &apos;ve ever been in .
here &apos;s the primary target , here &apos;s the secondary target , here &apos;s the teaming .
and the answer is , every single Swedish business leader does that every single day .
imagine if he would have had the kind of surveillance tools that are available today .
just as we created it .
Thank you very much .
as it went off , I took off and safely got to the other side .
it was a lot of hard work .
from that came a lot of insights , or outsi@@ ghts , as I called them , things that I learned since losing my sight .
some districts and cities have their own smell , as do places and things around you , and if you &apos;re lucky , you can even follow your nose to that new bakery that you &apos;ve been looking for .
it &apos;s a perfectly great city .
everybody &apos;s welcome .
so my suggestion is , turn youth into entrepreneurs , incub@@ ate and nurture their inherent innovation , and you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Parks than of car bombs and wai@@ thood .
Thank you .
but it all seemed fairly normal , going through it .
churches were starting their own running groups and their own support groups for people who were dealing with obesity .
okay , so most people are familiar with traditional , two-@@ person thumb-@@ wrestling .
that is not how you win .
I &apos;m reaching around and I &apos;m reaching up .
here &apos;s something called Ani@@ me Music Video , first example , taking ani@@ me captured from television re-@@ edited to music tracks .
and on the other side , among our kids , there &apos;s a growing copyright aboli@@ tionism , a generation that rejects the very notion of what copyright is supposed to do , rejects copyright and believes that the law is nothing more than an ass to be ignored and to be fought at every opportunity possible .
that artist choice is the key for new technology having an opportunity to be open for business , and we need to build artist choice here if these new technologies are to have that opportunity .
ordinary people live life against the law , and that &apos;s what I -- we are doing to our kids .
that realization is extraordinarily corrosive , extraordinarily corrup@@ ting .
( Applause )
now oil palm is a major driver of deforestation in that part of the world , so we wanted to use this new drone technology to keep track of the spread of these plantations in Southeast Asia .
many countries that you represent and where I come from struggle with the cost of healthcare .
so going the hospital is a lottery .
so the physicians get together , they agree on what quality is , they start measuring , they share the data , they find who &apos;s best , and they learn from it .
in three years &apos; time , we plan to have covered 40 percent of the disease burden .
this particular day , we sat in a workshop together with physicians , nurses and other staff , discussing leukemia in children .
two of our instruments are very unique : one is called an imaging spectr@@ ometer that can actually measure the chemical composition of plants as we fly over them .
the hottest pin@@ ks are the fastest-growing plants .
this technology allows me to remain engaged , mentally active , and feel like I am a part of the world .
I just wish I could afford the tuition . ( Laughter ) Chad Jen@@ kins : Henry , all joking aside , I bet all of these people here would love to see you fly this drone from your bed in California 3,000 miles away .
imagine if the next big network we built in the world was a network for the transportation of matter .
it happens mainly under two conditions .
they &apos;ve already gained experience from raising their own children .
practice for some reason became a very negative thing .
but let &apos;s play along .
and remarkably , that matches exactly what our ancestors are believed to have invented one and a half million years ago , when they invented cooking .
no other animal cooks its food . only humans do .
you had to go to the library , see if you could get them to find the books for you , you know , foot@@ notes and all that .
you haven &apos;t traded it in . you haven &apos;t worked for it .
and those who fail get another opportunity .
we rush through life . we don &apos;t stop .
and when you stop , then the next thing is to look .
in Britain , 63 percent of all men who come out of short sentences from prison re-@@ offend again within a year .
society wins : fewer crimes , fewer victims .
so children in the state care tend to do very badly .
that triggers the gradual development of the sexual organs , makes facial hair sprout , and causes the voice to deep@@ en and height to increase .
both hormones play a role in pregnancy , as well , alongside more than 10 other hormones that ensure the growth of the fetus , enable birth , and help the mother feed her child .
guess what . they don &apos;t .
what about animal testing ?
or someone who says they don &apos;t like teachers &apos; unions , I bet they &apos;re really devastated to see their kid &apos;s school going into the gu@@ tter , and they &apos;re just looking for someone to blame .
oil and gas companies use them for exploration and construction .
or bicycles : for example , in Amsterdam , more than 30 percent of the population uses bicycles , despite the fact that the Netherlands has a higher income per capita than the United States .
if more money is invested in highways , of course there is less money for housing , for schools , for hospitals , and also there is a conflict for space .
the first one is equality of quality of life , especially for children , that all children should have , beyond the obvious health and education , access to green spaces , to sports facilities , to swimming pools , to music lessons .
for example , this system in Gu@@ ang@@ z@@ hou is moving more passengers our direction than all subway lines in China , except for one line in Beijing , at a fraction of the cost .
ships have automation now .
they &apos;re at sea for months at a time , and even when they &apos;re on board , they don &apos;t have access to what a five-year-old would take for granted , the Internet .
and in fact , shipping has a role to play here , because shipping noise has contributed to damaging the acoustic habitats of ocean creatures .
I had luck . I was lucky , because this is a fact of life when you grow up in a place like that .
we wanted to use them to create openings .
( Laughter ) The rain in Bur@@ kina comes very fast , and after that , you have floods everywhere in the country .
by the end of every holidays , I had to say goodbye to the community , going from one compound to another one .
okay , a few of you .
it was so cold outside , we actually had to sleep inside the cave .
but there are some really cool things in there .
this duck died on the surface of the glacier long , long ago , and its feathers have finally made it down through over 100 feet of ice before falling inside the cave .
and the reason that it has had a renaissance is that probably about 10 percent of the people , severe de@@ pres@@ sives , do not respond , regardless of what is done for them .
you can be thrown off the track .
( Laughter ) Solly on the bank sees that I &apos;m in trouble .
as it bites the second time , I kick .
I &apos;m so happy because it was time for him to pass on .
and so of course there &apos;s the mixed emotions .
now , one group was asked to think about being dead .
it accepts that I &apos;m going to have to die but says , despite that , I can rise up and I can live again .
now , overcoming this bias is not easy because the fear of death is so deeply embedded in us , yet when we see that the fear itself is not rational , and when we bring out into the open the ways in which it can unconsciously bias us , then we can at least start to try to minimize the influence it has on our lives .
so the city is 13@@ 9 square miles .
now some of our audience members also tell us about some of the positive things that are happening in their communities , and many of them are ban@@ ding together to take control of some of the vacant lots , and they &apos;re starting community gardens , which are creating a great sense of community stewardship , but they &apos;re very , very clear to tell us that this is not enough , that they want to see their neighborhoods return to the way that their grandparents had found them .
so the descendants of the Great Migration could either become precision watch@@ makers at Shin@@ ola , like Willie H. , who was featured in one of their ads last year , or they can actually grow a business that would service companies like Shin@@ ola .
on October 14th , before we discovered it , it made its closest approach to the Earth , within about 15 million miles .
this is really close by astronomical standards .
its brightness wasn &apos;t constant .
increasingly sophisticated analytics then sift through the data , providing insights that allow us to operate the machines in entirely new ways , a lot more efficiently .
and not just individual machines , but fleets of locom@@ o@@ tives , airplanes , entire systems like power grids , hospitals .
imagine a patient who has suffered a severe trauma , and needs the attention of several specialists : a neurologist , a cardiologist , an orthopedic surgeon .
they &apos;ve created jobs .
if you told me that I &apos;d have to be depressed for the next month , I would say , &quot; As long I know it &apos;ll be over in November , I can do it . &quot;
and then I understood that actually , we aren &apos;t advanced enough in either area for it to explain things fully .
a lot of people said , when I chose to write about my depression , that it must be very difficult to be out of that closet , to have people know .
I said , &quot; Yes , people talk to me differently .
I went through a tribal ex@@ or@@ cism in Senegal that involved a great deal of ram &apos;s blood and that I &apos;m not going to detail right now , but a few years afterwards I was in Rwanda , working on a different project , and I happened to describe my experience to someone , and he said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s West Africa , and we &apos;re in East Africa , and our rituals are in some ways very different , but we do have some rituals that have something in common with what you &apos;re describing . &quot;
I must have depression . &quot;
and I turned in my story , and my editor called me and said , &quot; We really can &apos;t publish this . &quot;
so the second thing we learned , and this leads into my second point , which is that we believe that products need to be designed to be user-@@ centric .
( Laughter ) And the team is expert , and the team is courageous , and bri@@ mming with innovation and scientific discovery , as is true of any major expedition on the planet .
Bonnie and I look at each other and say , this year , the mantra is -- and I &apos;ve been using it in training -- F@@ ind a way .
and the vomiting starts , the seawater -- you &apos;re not well .
Bonnie made a decision coming into that third morning that I was suffering , and I was hanging on by a thread .
as I said , when I turned 60 , it wasn &apos;t about that concrete &quot; Can you do it ? &quot;
( Laughter ) on the beach .
I didn &apos;t give up .
what I want to do today , for the first time , is show you a little bit of what we saw .
now , I don &apos;t mean to suggest that it &apos;s only wealthy people who show these patterns of behavior .
and if it &apos;s the case , as we &apos;ve been finding , that the wealthier you are , the more entitled you feel to that wealth , and the more likely you are to prioritize your own interests above the interests of other people , and be willing to do things to serve that self-interest , well , then , there &apos;s no reason to think that those patterns will change .
and beyond the walls of our lab , we &apos;re even beginning to see signs of change in society .
Thank you .
we should really pray for her . &quot;
( Laughter ) And I &apos;ve since then tried to keep technology at arm &apos;s length in many ways , so it doesn &apos;t master my life .
at the same time , I run a website on cool tools , where I issue a daily obsession of the latest things in technology .
the second thing is is we see diversity . we also see specialization .
like those chlor@@ op@@ last cells -- they &apos;re completely surrounded by other life .
and it &apos;ll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that .
if you think of everything in your life that you own , when you walk out that door , what do you consider to take with you ?
and we do all this -- and to go back to the original question , what do people carry ?
I mean , I couldn &apos;t take your phones off you if I wanted to .
and it turns out , from our research , that it boils down to survival -- survival for us and survival for our loved ones .
and you can do them with phone kios@@ ks .
I think , quite a nice feature .
you can &apos;t ask someone to do that on your behalf .
I &apos;m sending money back , and it works like this .
this was me at age 13 , when I started my first diet .
that &apos;s what a thermostat does , right ?
no . no , right ?
of course , when you digitize , that &apos;s not enough , because these documents , most of them are in Latin , in Tus@@ can , in Vene@@ tian dialect , so you need to tran@@ scribe them , to translate them in some cases , to index them , and this is obviously not easy .
and this giant information system can be searched in many ways .
and from that , you can do things like reconstructing this extraordinary journey of that city that managed to have a sustainable development over a thousand years , managing to have all the time a form of equilibrium with its environment .
it &apos;s not about selling soap , it &apos;s about making sure that in the process of doing so you can change people &apos;s lives .
this is the patent .
that &apos;s a pretty hard act to beat .
however , 20 percent of the population have a thing called needle phobia .
now we make the Nanopatch with a technique called deep reactive ion et@@ ching .
on the vertical axis we have the immune response generated , and that d@@ ashed line indicates the protection threshold .
and the answer to what would I do if I wasn &apos;t afraid is I would get on the TED stage , and talk about women , and leadership . and I did , and survived . ( Applause ) PM : I would say , not only survived . I &apos;m thinking of that moment , Sheryl , when you and I were standing backstage together , and you turned to me , and you told me a story .
so he could call evenly on men and women . and what he proved to himself was that the women knew the answers just as well or better , and he was able to go back to them and tell them that .
now we have , all over the world , women are called &quot; bos@@ sy . &quot; there is a word for &quot; bos@@ sy , &quot; for little girls , in every language there &apos;s one .
if you &apos;re a woman , please raise your hand if you &apos;ve ever been told you &apos;re too aggressive at work .
or then there &apos;s this , or rather these : the two versions of Leonardo &apos;s &quot; Virgin of the Roc@@ ks &quot; that were about to come together in London for the very first time .
it &apos;s not an escap@@ ism that we feel particularly happy with today , however .
and he now ad@@ or@@ ns my office .
and I was really amazed , because my name was the second name on the list -- the previous name was in 18@@ 89 .
let &apos;s call it the calculated brain .
se@@ f : absolutely , that &apos;s right , it &apos;s sex . ( Laughter ) A@@ cross the Arab region , the only accepted context for sex is marriage -- approved by your parents , sanc@@ tioned by religion and registered by the state .
Faiza was living proof of this .
they are expected to bear the burden of costs in married life , but they can &apos;t find jobs .
even by educated people , who often feel more comfortable talking about sex in a foreign language than they do in their own tongue .
that very sentence already reveals the doom , destruction of happiness .
some medit@@ ators , without trying to stop it , but simply by being completely open , thinking that that bang is just going to be a small event like a shooting star , they are able not to move at all .
depression is the number one cause of disability in women in the world today .
now , mon@@ ey@@ ball , as many of you know , is what the Oakland A &apos;s did , where they used smart data and statistics to figure out how to pick players that would help them win games , and they went from a system that was based on baseball scouts who used to go out and watch players and use their instinct and experience , the scouts &apos; instincts and experience , to pick players , from one to use smart data and rigorous statistical analysis to figure out how to pick players that would help them win games .
and why is that ?
but truthfully , we all spend sort of a big part of our lives just trying not to be gross .
girls cooked ; boys didn &apos;t , or so was the message that Has@@ bro was sending .
and you may be asking yourself which side I &apos;m on , biology or physics ?
( Applause ) Dan@@ ia Ger@@ hard@@ t : Thank you very much , Nicol@@ as , for this great start . little bit nervous ?
you brought some examples : the females are the social ones , the females are the dominant ones , I &apos;m not sure who thinks how .
for examples , in sea horses or in ko@@ alas , in fact , it is the males who take care of the young always .
I only knew I wanted to make pretty creations that were safe for the environment and I wanted to give back .
that is when opportunities and innovation are created , and that is why ideas come to life .
PTSD has been called &quot; the hidden wound &quot; because it comes without outward physical signs .
in the case of opioids , this often involves precisely not we@@ aning the patient off the medication , but transitioning them onto the safer , longer-@@ acting opioids : meth@@ ad@@ one or bu@@ pr@@ enor@@ ph@@ ine for maintenance treatment .
the prescri@@ bers saw me as a complex patient needing specialized care , probably from pain medicine .
these sorts of considerations help to explain why America , despite accounting for only five percent of the global population , consumes nearly 70 percent of the total global opioid supply .
in closing , I need to say that properly managing prescribed opioids will not by itself solve the crisis .
we were making what was invisible visible .
( Laughter ) Ten years later , after lots of hard work , we finally passed the Viol@@ ence Against Women Act , which is a life-changing act that has saved so many lives . ( Applause ) Thank you .
I was proud to be part of that work , and it changed the laws and it put millions of dollars into local communities .
now , like most of us , I &apos;d been online , I &apos;d see my house , so I thought , I &apos;ll hop in there and I &apos;ll start looking up some of these facilities .
because there aren &apos;t very many of them , the pictures that we see on a daily basis tend to be old .
and there &apos;s no adap@@ tion .
and the answer seems to be yes .
and this graph from Ken Cal@@ de@@ ira . it &apos;s important to say came , because Ken -- at a meeting that I believe Mar@@ ty Hoff@@ art was also at in the mid- &apos; 90s -- Ken and I stood up at the back of the meeting and said , &quot; Ge@@ o-@@ engineering won &apos;t work . &quot;
maybe another knob is a knob for controlling CO2 concentrations .
they have no interest in crazy ideas like engineering the whole planet .
this polarization of en@@ cla@@ ves of mega-@@ wealth surrounded by sectors of poverty and the socioeconomic inequalities they have en@@ gendered is really at the center of today &apos;s urban crisis .
to give you a sense of scale , the largest panel is about two meters high .
in cosmology , for example , there have been a variety of different threads of evidence that our universe appears to be finely tuned for the development of intelligence , and , in particular , for the development of universal states that maximize the diversity of possible futures .
finally , here we see Entropica spontaneously discovering and executing a buy-@@ low , sel@@ l-@@ high strategy on a simulated range traded stock , successfully growing assets under management exponentially .
and as a consequence , across the Western world , the over-@@ simplistic policies of the parties of protest and their appeal to a largely disillusioned , older demographic , along with the apathy and obsession with the trivial that ty@@ pi@@ fies at least some of the young , taken together , these and other similarly contemporary ab@@ er@@ rations are threatening to squeeze the life out of active , informed debate and engagement , and I stress active .
democracy , in order to work , requires that reasonable men and women take the time to understand and debate difficult , sometimes complex issues , and they do so in an atmosphere which stri@@ ves for the type of understanding that leads to , if not agreement , then at least a productive and work@@ able compromise .
politics is about choices , and within those choices , politics is about priorities .
we can basically summarize it through a triple process .
we can also imagine a chemical treatment for break@@ ups that weakens the feelings of attachment .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We are all useless .
in contrast to this attitude , I call upon tenderness -- love as tenderness .
and so what happens is , we waste more food .
the drawer that you put your lettuces in ?
these poor little lettuces are getting thrown out left , right and center because the cri@@ sper drawers are not designed to actually keep things crisp .
the user actually has to push that button to get their hot water boiled , which means , because we &apos;re all lazy , you only fill exactly what you need .
and he said , &quot; Well , recently I pitched a sustainability project to a client , and turned and he said to me , &apos; I know it &apos;s going to cost less , I know it &apos;s going to sell more , but we &apos;re not pioneers , because pioneers have arrows in their backs . &apos; &quot; I think we &apos;ve got a room@@ ful of pioneers , and I hope there are far more pioneers out there , because we need to solve these problems .
but we persevered .
in a few short years , we have shown that our model works , is high-@@ impact and can turn a profit , attracting commercial investors that do not typically invest in small farmers in Africa .
now over almost eight years , they &apos;ve out@@ performed by about two thirds .
well , maybe not if you live in Boston . ( Laughter ) But my point is that we buy insurance to protect ourselves financially in case those things happen , right ?
that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to share with you .
why don &apos;t we take the source from the person we want the voice to sound like , because it &apos;s preserved , and borrow the filter from someone about the same age and size , because they can articulate speech , and then mix them ?
that &apos;s the science behind what we &apos;re doing .
RP : so now , Samantha can say this .
this is a guy called Norman Bor@@ lau@@ g . he won the Nobel Prize . he &apos;s got the Congressional Med@@ al of Honor . he deserves all of this stuff . and he deserves this stuff because he probably has fed more people than any other human being alive because he researched how to put biology behind seeds . he did this in Mexico . the reason why India and China no longer have these massive famines is because Norman Bor@@ lau@@ g taught them how to grow grains in a more efficient way and launched the Green Revolution . that is something that a lot of people have criticized . but of course , those are people who don &apos;t realize that China and India , instead of having huge amounts of starving people , are exporting grains .
any place you see a differential , there &apos;re some interesting questions . there &apos;s some questions as to what you should be doing with this stuff . but again , coal . maybe the same stuff , maybe the same system , maybe bioenergy , and you &apos;re applying exactly the same technology .
and as you think about this stuff and what the implications of this are , we &apos;re going to start not just converting ethanol from corn with very high subsidies . we &apos;re going to start thinking about biology entering energy . it is very expensive to process this stuff , both in economic terms and in energy terms .
I also met a number of nonprofit leaders who , despite very limited financial resources , were making a huge impact in the world , often bringing together seeming adversaries .
there &apos;s an expression : go along to get along .
now interestingly , the people who will join you are not your usual suspects in your network .
so what I &apos;m asking today , the question I want to explore with you today is , what kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality ?
and those of us who have chosen to be monogamous -- my parents , for example , have been married for 52 years mono@@ gam@@ ously , and if it wasn &apos;t mono@@ gam@@ ously , Mom and Dad , I don &apos;t want to hear about it - I &apos;m not criticizing this and I &apos;m not saying there &apos;s anything wrong with this .
( Applause ) Thank you .
it &apos;s time we moved beyond Mars and Venus , because the truth is that men are from Africa and women are from Africa .
how is that different from the talk you gave ?
and so you could live on McDonald &apos;s and milk@@ shakes , but your body will rebel against that . we have appeti@@ tes .
it &apos;s the idea that if you love your husband or wife but you still are attracted to other people , there &apos;s something wrong with you , there &apos;s something wrong with your marriage , something wrong with your partner .
the dad would awkwardly shuffle his newspaper and the mom would shoot a chilling stare at her kid .
we need to stop ranking our hard against everyone else &apos;s hard to make us feel better or worse about our closets and just com@@ miser@@ ate on the fact that we all have hard .
and so in a lot of places , there really aren &apos;t a lot of good solutions for getting around traffic .
first of all , you &apos;ve got a whole other dimension , but also just safety considerations and air-@@ traffic management will not allow bu@@ m@@ per@@ -to-@@ bumper traffic in the sky .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : OK , so when these things first roll out -- right now , it &apos;s a single person aircraft , right ?
could we do a poll here ?
CA : so , first , this is ride sharing .
you know , there are millennials that say they never want to own a car .
we are these last wil@@ der@@ nesses -- every one of us .
in seven du@@ gout canoes ; 1,500 miles , 1@@ 21 days later , all of the pol@@ ing , padd@@ ling and intensive research got us across the entire river basin to Lake X@@ au in the Kal@@ a@@ hari Desert , 4@@ 80 kilometers past the Okavango Delta .
there is no doubt this is the biggest conservation opportunity in Africa in decades .
let me tell you a little bit about why this is .
so she asked , &quot; Eat what ? do you want to eat ice cream ?
it &apos;s a past tense .
I told whom ? I told the carpenter .
but if you look at what &apos;s inside the engine , it &apos;s actually not very complicated .
I mean , just think about that .
but equally , each of these individual four cells alone or together , can go rogue or die , and when that happens , you get damage .
you get damaged wiring .
but what happens when that myelin cell dies ?
it is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent , it &apos;s being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster .
you were lied to .
and dark matter is no exception .
and this is very important , because what it means is that very , very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab , might be compounded and compounded into something that we could possibly observe in nature .
I &apos;m going to talk a little bit about strategy and its relationship with technology .
the encyclopedia business in the days of leather@@ bound books was basically a distribution business .
this kind of thinking isn &apos;t new .
you think the Internet was big .
sure enough . OK . I used to work in this field of elementary particles .
we look deeper and deeper into the structure of particles , and in that way we get probably closer and closer to this fundamental law .
so here we say , again , what we said before : that each skin of the onion shows a similarity to the ad@@ joining skins .
and then there is self-@@ similarity across the scales -- in other words , from one skin of the onion to another one .
they follow from the fundamental theory .
gamma &apos;s software has been located on servers in countries around the world , many with really atro@@ cious track records and human rights violations .
gamma is not the only company in the business .
what I thought was most fascinating was they &apos;ve actually paid for the coffee break at one of the law enforcement conferences earlier this year .
why is that so , that Alex in Kenya , Fa@@ tima in Bangladesh , Nav@@ jo@@ ot in Mumbai , and Julie and Mary in Uganda still wait months to be able to diagnose why they are sick ?
it starts with a single sheet of paper .
there it is , and it survives .
( Applause )
and to get there , we have to change our workplaces , our policies and our culture .
in the workplace , real equality means valuing family just as much as work , and understanding that the two reinforce each other .
sadly , though , the obsession with work is no longer a uniquely American disease .
and as many women hold that view as men do .
by the way , you can update Facebook and send G@@ mail from a phone like this .

in just its third year , H@@ itch served 30 million trips in this past holiday season , the longest of which was further than 1,500 miles .
it &apos;s about 80 percent larger than Amazon .

this is really where the pediatric endocrine realm comes in , because , in fact , if you &apos;re going to deal with it in kids aged 10 to 14 , that &apos;s pediatric endo@@ crin@@ ology .
and as they evolved and grew more and more over millions and millions of years , that oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere .
do you ever wonder what &apos;s feeding them ?
after all , you pointed out that reason is just a means to an end , and the end depends on the reason@@ er &apos;s passions .
RNG : well , you didn &apos;t mention what might be one of our most effective better angels : reason .
and we had talked about that many , many times before .
do you know , in some states across America you need less identification to open up a company than you do to get a library card , like Delaware , which is one of the easiest places in the world to set up an anonymous company .
and it is a true challenge , and I do want you to help me .
journalists , this is off the record ; it &apos;s embar@@ go@@ ed .
that pad comes out . and that &apos;s where the glue is .
but it makes an incredible Band-Aid .
you have the audio ? you can hear it go up .
so this is not using any suction , any glue , and it will ultimately , when it &apos;s attached to the robot -- it &apos;s as biologically inspired as the animal -- hopefully be able to climb any kind of a surface .
and so they were able to get this thing -- this is now sped up 20 times -- can you imagine it trying to go up and rescue somebody at that upper floor ? OK ?
that nature uses hybrid solutions , not a single solution , to these problems , and they &apos;re integrated and beautifully robust .
these aren &apos;t the people that we want deciding what the role of corporate America in a free and open Internet should be .
some are somewhat less responsible .
they said no . they said , we don &apos;t track those stats , and we can &apos;t track those stats .
they say hey , we need to work with you to secure your systems , but in reality , they &apos;re giving bad advice to these companies that makes them degrade the security of their services .
how are you coping with the fear ?

so NSA has two missions .
and so that &apos;s the national and international conversation that we &apos;re having , and we want to participate in that , and want people to participate in it in an informed way .
and so the fact that these revelations have been broadly characterized as &quot; you can &apos;t trust company A because your privacy is suspect with them &quot; is actually only accurate in the sense that it &apos;s accurate with every other company in the world that deals with any of those countries in the world .
and they &apos;re actually using that to counter the very large technological edge that U.S. companies have in areas like the cloud and Inter@@ ne@@ t-based technologies .
one is , you said weaken encryption . I didn &apos;t .
you know , your computer doesn &apos;t know where you are , it doesn &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing , it doesn &apos;t know what you know , and a lot we &apos;ve been trying to do recently is just make your devices work , make them understand your context .
I think I am searching for a better life for me and my neighbors .
LP : yeah , but it turns out , we did some weather simulations which probably hadn &apos;t really been done before , and if you control the altitude of the balloons , which you can do by pumping air into them and other ways , you can actually control roughly where they go , and so I think we can build a worldwide mesh of these balloons that can cover the whole planet .
LP : yes . the privacy side , I think it &apos;s -- the world is changing .
and when someone access@@ es your medical record , a research doctor , they could see , you could see which doctor accessed it and why , and you could maybe learn about what conditions you have .
you are one of those people who believe that corporations are an agent of change if they are run well .
CR : you once said , actually , as I think I &apos;ve got this about right , that you might consider , rather than giving your money , if you were leaving it to some cause , just simply giving it to Elon Musk , because you had confidence that he would change the future , and that you would therefore - LP : yeah , if you want to go Mars , he wants to go to Mars , to back up humanity , that &apos;s a worthy goal , but it &apos;s a company , and it &apos;s philanthro@@ pical .

today , these roads that inter@@ connect our world are dominated by cars and trucks that have remained largely unchanged for 100 years .
besides , once the first drivers explain to their confused car that the giant chicken at the fork in the road is actually a restaurant , and it &apos;s okay to keep driving , every other car on the surface of the Earth will know that from that point on .
we need to help them to find their own role models , and give them the confidence to believe in themselves and to believe that anything is possible , and just as my grandpa did when he took me shopping for surplus , and just as my parents did when they took me to science museums , we need to encourage them to find their own path , even if it &apos;s very different from our own .

the roles of our children have changed .
kids were considered economic assets .
we recognized kids had rights , we banned child labor , we focused on education instead , and school became a child &apos;s new work .
it would probably be easier for parents to do their new roles if they knew what they were preparing their kids for .
we call it the DBC .
of course , the applications go as far as the imagination goes .
( Applause ) With digital information traveling at the speed of light , it would only take minutes to send those digital instructions from Earth to Mars , but it would take months to physically deliver those same samples on a spacecraft .

I want to take a look at what &apos;s really behind this march of athletic progress .
in 1972 , Ed@@ dy Mer@@ ck@@ x set the record for the longest distance cycled in one hour at 30 miles , 3,@@ 7@@ 74 feet .
the financial incentives and fame and glory afforded elite athletes skyrocke@@ ted , and it tipped toward the tiny upper ec@@ hel@@ on of performance .
seven inches difference in height , these men have the same length legs .
there &apos;s no explosion there .
we have an arch in our foot that acts like a spring , short toes that are better for pushing off than for grasping tree limbs , and when we run , we can turn our torso and our shoulders like this while keeping our heads straight .
we can talk about the role of vegetation in transporting water from the soils back into the atmosphere .
when something changes , what happens to those properties ?

to create the robotic illusion , we &apos;ve devised a set of ethical rules , a code that all robots would live by .
now , we did what we knew , how we had grown up , and one of the things that we knew , that was in our DNA , was secrecy .
we had to change from who needs to know to the fact that who doesn &apos;t know , and we need to tell , and tell them as quickly as we can .

approximately 30 years ago , when I was in onco@@ logy at the Children &apos;s Hospital in Philadelphia , a father and a son walked into my office and they both had their right eye missing , and as I took the history , it became apparent that the father and the son had a rare form of inherited eye tumor , retin@@ ob@@ la@@ stom@@ a , and the father knew that he had passed that fate on to his son .
we &apos;d have to go and have a pretty wide study , and we realized that actually one way to think of this is , let us look at adults who are over 40 years of age , and let &apos;s make sure that we look at those who were healthy as kids .
and they didn &apos;t say , &quot; Where &apos;s the MTA ? &quot;

the grizzly would soon be wiped out from 95 percent of its original territory , and whereas once there had been 30 million bison moving across the plains , and you would have these stories of trains having to stop for four or five hours so that these thick , living rivers of the animals could pour over the tracks , now , by 1902 , there were maybe less than 100 left in the wild .
so some of my favorites include that the more television a person watches in Up@@ state New York , the more he or she is afraid of being attacked by a black bear .
so we exert our power , but then we &apos;re un@@ settled by how powerful we are .
I have to create a framework that you then fill in with your imagination .
and I &apos;ve been on the receiving end of that , and it doesn &apos;t feel very good .
we &apos;re near@@ ing the end of our third year .
six@@ ty-three percent of our families have never heard of the E@@ I@@ TC .
it &apos;s not that I intentionally prioritized those things , it &apos;s just the easiest to vet for online .
of my 29 qualified leads , only 15 replied to my message , and of those , six scheduled a zero date .
( Laughter ) None of these is actually real .
basically what this syndrome causes , is that I cannot gain weight .
if somebody is annoying me , being rude : stand on my right side .
so I told myself I &apos;m going to work my butt off and do whatever I could to make myself better , because in my mind , the best way that I could get back at all those people who made fun of me , who teased me , who called me ugly , who called me a monster was to make myself better , and to show them : you know what ?
so this suggests that once we think about something as a loss , that way of thinking about it tends to stick in our heads and to resist our attempts to change it .
you &apos;re fluent in the language of reading images .
they &apos;d rather live off of the excess of what they view as a wasteful consumer society than slave away at an unrealistic chance at the traditional American dream .
after he died , I realized that no one writes to me anymore .
if a fraction of this powerful TED audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper -- John , it &apos;ll be a recycled one -- and write a beautiful letter to someone they love , we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to pen@@ manship classes .
some say we already share our planet with alien intelli@@ gences .
in my experience , when people sit down and do the math , they typically conclude there are thousands of civilizations in the galaxy .
yet others -- that we &apos;re living in a simulation .
a very specific thing happened .
every morning at breakfast , you can go outside the front of the house and make an offering to the god tree , the n@@ ya@@ me du@@ a outside your house , and again , you &apos;ll talk to the gods and the high gods and the low gods and the ancestors and so on .
we asked half of them to predict for us how much their values would change in the next 10 years , and the others to tell us how much their values had changed in the last 10 years .
for example , name your best friend , your favorite kind of vacation , what &apos;s your favorite hobby , what &apos;s your favorite kind of music .
that is the reveal St@@ ev@@ ens saves for that fourth stan@@ za , where run away has become a refrain .
that &apos;s what John Ke@@ ats is doing in his most mysterious , perhaps , poem .
robust systems are also fault tolerant and fail@@ -@@ safe .
five to 10 years from now , search engines will actually be based on not just looking for combinations of words and links but actually understanding , reading for understanding the billions of pages on the web and in books .
twenty years from now , we &apos;ll have nan@@ obots , because another exponential trend is the shrinking of technology .
Nelson Mandela led South Africa after the dark and brutal days of A@@ par@@ theid , and out of the ashes of that leg@@ alized racial discrimination , he led South Africa to become the first country in the world to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation within its constitution .
yeah , I know . what a contradiction .
and I said , &quot; What speech ? &quot;
these are just a couple of examples , but there are a lot of these images out there .
there are some cha@@ sms so deep and so wide , we find it hard to imagine how we &apos;ll ever make it to the other side .
perhaps you have met one or two of the virtuous on your path .
I didn &apos;t really know what it did , but I cop@@ y-@@ pasted it and used it anyway to get into a pass@@ wor@@ d-@@ protected site like that .
this is because access to information is a critical currency of power , one which governments would like to control , a thing they attempt to do by setting up all-@@ you-@@ can@@ -@@ eat surveillance programs , a thing they need hackers for , by the way .
but if you believe the way science is taught , and if you believe textbooks , you &apos;re liable to have the following sche@@ ma of research .
it &apos;s called saying &quot; Yes , and &quot; to the offers made by other actors .
that &apos;s the beautiful thing about science .
here I am alone in my office , but I &apos;m not alone at all .
we &apos;re part of the same family .
one set of people look frightened . ( Laughter ) They often say something like , &quot; Oh , I &apos;d better be careful what I say .
and then my all-time favorite word at this vote , which is &quot; multi-@@ sl@@ acking . &quot;
what I &apos;m saying is , we should be less quick to decide that that change is terrible , we should be less quick to impose our likes and dis@@ likes about words on other people , and we should be entirely reluctant to think that the English language is in trouble .
I hope you can enjoy being part of the creativity that is continually re@@ making our language and keeping it robust .
well , that struck me as the height of extravag@@ ance and frivol@@ ity .
so if what matters to us -- a child &apos;s delight , the love you have for your partner - can &apos;t be represented by real numbers , then there &apos;s no reason to believe that in choice , there are only three possibilities -- that one alternative is better , worse or equal to the other .
we all know people like that .
I &apos;d been raised to judge people based on arbitrary measurements , like a person &apos;s race or religion .
I had never had a Jewish friend before , and frankly I felt a sense of pride in having been able to overcome a barrier that for most of my life I had been led to believe was insurmountable .
we can more and more easily make contact with people on the furthest corners of the planet , but sometimes in that process we lose contact with ourselves .
the one thing perhaps that technology hasn &apos;t always given us is a sense of how to make the wi@@ sest use of technology .
and I think many of us have the sensation , I certainly do , that we &apos;re standing about two inches away from a huge screen , and it &apos;s noisy and it &apos;s crowded and it &apos;s changing with every second , and that screen is our lives .
it goes up more than 300 meters in the air , to breathe fresh air .
well , there &apos;s not a very good reason to show you this picture .
they have a sound , they have a voice , those buildings .
Thank you .
but I did inherit his love for making , except that it doesn &apos;t exist that much anymore .
these are shoes that represent the continuation of his passion for hyper-@@ local manufacturing .
I suggest finance leaders ask a suite of three questions of any company in which they might invest our money .
it is not well known that the tobacco industry significantly relies on child labor .
they literally brought all the gardens and decided to save them .

I &apos;ve been solving my whole life .
( Laughter ) Now , solving exists across all cultures .
the date is March 18th , 2014 .
in fact , it was beginning , and the 23 years since is a story of acknowledgment , apology and at@@ on@@ ement .
and on this particular day , I opened this letter , and in capital letters , he wrote , &quot; My mama told me why you was in prison : murder . &quot;
important health message : blogging may be hazardous to your health , especially if you are a male .
a lot of people are frustrated with passwords , and it &apos;s bad enough when you have to have one really good password that you can remember but nobody else is going to be able to guess .
now entropy is a complicated term , but basically it measures the strength of passwords .
how long is it ? does it have a digit ?
and were you annoyed at having to create a new one last week ?
do they actually help people have stronger passwords , and if so , which ones are better ?
now another approach to better passwords , perhaps , is to use pass phrases instead of passwords .
they ran the code .
for the last 10 years , my colleagues and I have developed a philosophy and research program that we call effective altruism .
on our current best estimates , we can save a life by distributing long-lasting insectici@@ de-@@ treated bed nets for just a few thousand dollars .
the earth will remain habitable for 500 million years to come .
and this is just the next few thousand years .
now , I &apos;m not saying that any of these risks are particularly likely , but when there &apos;s so much at stake , even small probabilities matter a great deal .
and I think the answer is yes , and that &apos;s because problems that affect future generations are often hugely neglected .
do we have the wrong guy ?
but to ask whether an individual should have such power in the first place is to put history itself on trial .
smoking can cause cancer in multiple tissues and organs , as well as damaged eyesight and weakened bones .
after 12 hours , carbon mono@@ xide levels stabilize , increasing the blood &apos;s oxygen-@@ carrying capacity .
so why should we believe the science ?
when Einstein developed the theory of general relativity , one of the consequences of his theory was that space-time wasn &apos;t just an empty void but that it actually had a fabric .
now , sometimes this theory or this model is referred to as the deduc@@ tive-@@ nom@@ ological model , mainly because academics like to make things complicated .
you can tell he &apos;s Scottish because he &apos;s wearing a de@@ er@@ stal@@ ker cap and Well@@ ington boots .
it &apos;s quite hard to persuade the scientific community to say , &quot; Yes , we know something , this is true . &quot;
they have to explain to us not just what they know but how they know it , and it means that we have to become better listeners .
turn it just a bit .
you know , this is before radio , before recording .
perhaps that &apos;s not necessary .
any time you &apos;re going to talk to anybody important , do these .
so that &apos;s what I did . I came in on a Saturday morning , and about 10 hours in , I sort of had all the pieces to the puzzle .
but instead of just going home and calling it qu@@ its , I took a step back and asked myself , what went wrong here ?
so this is what Russian looks like in a visual abstraction .
we &apos;ve only begun to unlock the capabilities of our minds to process visual information .
in fact , from this perspective , I could tell , this isn &apos;t code .
but if I had to put it in a nutshell these days , I sort of feel that globalization has taken us by surprise , and we &apos;ve been slow to respond to it .
this is the problem : countries competing against each other , countries fighting against each other .
we mean countries that seem to contribute something to the world in which we live , countries that actually make the world safer or better or richer or fairer .
when you &apos;re talking about a good country , you can be good , goo@@ der and goo@@ dest .
they &apos;re also all rich .
they &apos;ve spent a great deal of time over the last decades building their own economy , building their own society and their own pol@@ ity , but it is to be hoped that the second phase of their growth will be somewhat more outwar@@ d-@@ looking than the first phase has been so far .
what &apos;s it there for ?
what &apos;s really cool as well is that there &apos;s a transfer of skills and knowledge across generations , from masters to apprenti@@ ces , but it &apos;s done through active learning , through heuri@@ stic learning , learning by doing and by making .
the structures essentially are simple trus@@ ses which bolt together .
it &apos;s even bigger than the China GDP .
so let us choose to embrace AI and to love one another .
he just arbitr@@ arily divided them up .
and the case that &apos;s been most studied is the case of race .
they were the same baseball cards .
the ones held by black hands got substantially smaller bi@@ ds than the ones held by white hands .
in research done at Stanford , psychologists explored the case of people sentenced for the murder of a white person .
my father was a San Franci@@ scan .
we were taken from our home and loaded on to train cars with other Japanese-@@ American families .
that act of patriotism was answered with a slap in the face .
now , the first thing that you need to know about designing at scale is that the little things really matter .
so they added a new feature that allowed people to message their friend to ask them to take the photo down .
now , years ago , when I was working at YouTube , we were looking for ways to encourage more people to rate videos , and it was interesting because when we looked into the data , we found that almost everyone was exclusively using the highest five-star rating , a handful of people were using the lowest one-@@ star , and virtually no one was using two , three or four stars .
this is what Google , YouTube and Facebook look like to most of the world , and it &apos;s what they &apos;ll look like to most of the next five billion people to come online .
striking .
a speck of snow , an inch of ice , the force of the wind , can determine the result of a race or a game .
( Laughter ) All the cameras were , of course , on Sophia .
by the way , 80 percent of all refugees and displaced people in the world are women and girls .
the place is a small women &apos;s clinic in a village in Bangladesh .
I &apos;m talking about men with young minds , of course .
and the interesting thing here is how did - ( Applause ) - Thank you .
they make new cell phones like kids in Palo Alto make websites , and so there &apos;s a rainforest of innovation going on in the cell phone .
for his efforts , Mr. Bi@@ hi has been ostrac@@ ized by the leadership of the A@@ bu@@ ba@@ kar A@@ s-@@ S@@ addi@@ que Islamic Center , with which he used to have good relations .
we don &apos;t have the right to be silent about them because it is easier or because Western policy is flawed as well , because 5 : 17 is still coming to too many Amel Zen@@ oun@@ es in places like northern Nigeria , where jiha@@ dis still kill students .
and one of the keys for anybody who wants to start something in life : make sure your president is part of it .
and the reason I show this car in actually a rather ugly slide is just again to tell you the kind of story that characterized a little bit of my life .
this isn &apos;t quite as far-fetched , so 30 years from now .
last year , my friend Bernard Har@@ court at the University of Chicago organized an event , a conference on the idea of chance .
and there is an important message that I did learn .
it &apos;s a bit like Google Earth , except it &apos;s up@@ -to-@@ date imagery , and you can see back through time .
now , imagine how useful this would be to people in coast guards who are trying to track and stop illegal fishing .
and it has this constant vo@@ ice@@ over narrative in your stream of conscious thinking .
but it doesn &apos;t address the real mystery at the core of this subject : why is it that all that physical processing in a brain should be accompanied by consciousness at all ?
his crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness .
but the thought is maybe photons might have some element of raw , subjective feeling , some primitive precursor to consciousness .
I thought it was going to be like on TV .
here &apos;s a set of bone marrow biopsy tools .
but right at the moment of puncture , the tissue can &apos;t push back on the tip anymore .
when I was growing up , I liked taking toys apart , any kind of toys I &apos;d find around the house , like my brother &apos;s B@@ B gun when he &apos;s not home .
I used a lot of computer cooling fans and just kind of put them together and see what happens .
she said , &quot; I want to save because I want to buy a plastic sheet before the mon@@ so@@ ons arrive .
Kerabai said , &quot; Don &apos;t you realize that it &apos;s a terrible drought ?
but she worked very hard .
and if you want , it can be yours also .
and you know , he was so generous ; I couldn &apos;t believe it .
I used to have the &quot; Or@@ din@@ ary People &quot; script that I &apos;d flip through .
( video ) Father : C &apos;@@ mere .
it &apos;s why when people do sequ@@ els , or rip off movies , you know , of a genre , they &apos;re ripping off the wrong thing .
the most incredible sort of mystery , I think , is now the question of what comes next .
and I thought back to what I would have done using the Super 8 camera that my grandfather got me sitting in that room , and I realized that hand didn &apos;t have to be Ed@@ die Mar@@ san &apos;s .
let &apos;s meet some of them .
during the civil war , he and his family were forced to flee to Nigeria .
in large parts of the world , higher education is un@@ at@@ tainable for an average citizen .
this is the story of countless women in Africa , for example , prevented from higher education because of cultural barriers .
over 3,000 of them , including presidents , vice chan@@ cell@@ ors , professors and academic advisers from top universities such as NYU , Yale , Berkeley and Oxford , came on board to help our students .
finally , is our belief in peer-to-peer learning .
it is our mission that nobody will be left behind for financial reasons .
social media plays a big role here , too .
I was convinced I wasn &apos;t going to be a science major , that maybe I was dropping out of college altogether .
for all these tasks , highly specialized departments were responsible .
the main reasons why people cooper@@ ated with the Stasi were political conviction and material benefits .
I remember telling a leading Stasi officer , &quot; If you had sent an informant to me , I would surely have recognized him . &quot;
but actually , it &apos;s a quite accurate description .
( Applause ) BG : when the story came out first , last July , last year , you filed a criminal complaint with a German tribu@@ nal . why ?
( Laughter ) When I was singing a lot of jazz , I worked a lot with a pianist whose name was Steve .
in 1980 , the top one percent of Americans shared about eight percent of national &#91; income &#93; , while the bottom 50 percent of Americans shared 18 percent .
we reminded them that low-wage workers make terrible taxpayers , and that when you raise the minimum wage for all businesses , all businesses benefit yet all can compete .
miss Margaret had been a front-@@ desk specialist for almost 20 years .
she gave her six genders , eight races and over 100 ethnicities .
( Laughter ) Because of the way she presented it to me , I was like , &quot; Girl , why ?
and we have underprivileged populations that remain unfortunate and underprivileged , because the data that we &apos;re using is either outdated , or is not good at all or we don &apos;t have anything at all .
as a kid I always loved information that I could get from data and the stories that could be told with numbers .
as a statistician , I want people to show me the data so I can decide for myself .
he said , &quot; Well , we don &apos;t want to take any chances . &quot;
but we were confident to leave because we had been collecting data .
had I not been taking my temperature I really would have just thought my period was late that month , but we actually had data to show that we had mi@@ scar@@ ried this baby , and even though this data revealed a really unfortunate event in our lives , it was information that we could then take to our doctor .
what is it that we can do to help prevent this problem ?
we met violence with force and chaos with chaos .
now the biggest and most controversial component of this design , of course , was the toilet .
so next , I got reas@@ signed as superintendent of a small prison .
I was excited . staff were excited .
everybody wanted to be part of this .
oftentimes , they know more about our own systems than the people who run them .
our strategy is hundreds of small changes that take place in days or months , not years .
disappears right into the background .
civic imagination and innovation and creativity are emerging from local ecosystems now and radiating outward , and this great innovation , this great wave of local@@ ism that &apos;s now arriving , and you see it in how people eat and work and share and buy and move and live their everyday lives , this isn &apos;t some precious parochi@@ alism , this isn &apos;t some retreat into in@@ su@@ lar@@ ity , no .
so here are some of the things which maybe threaten the social web we have .
let &apos;s do that this year .
that equals up to a little over five billion lunches made every school year .

I no longer look at animals at the species level .

Freeman Dy@@ son , in a TED Talk , fore@@ saw that children will design and create new organisms just as routinely as his generation played with chemistry sets .
so studying the forensics of our solar system doesn &apos;t just tell us about the past , it can also predict the future , including our future .
science can , in our lifetimes -- even in a decade -- transform what it means to have a specific illness .
one will respond to a molecule that the other doesn &apos;t respond to , they &apos;ll make different molecules .
we wanted to make it possible to learn all of this quickly and systematically .
imagine if you were trying to understand how a big city like New York works , but you could only do so by reviewing some statistics about the average resident of New York .
very few traits are that simple .
and I wanted to show you , also , the suggestions from Kentucky are pretty good -- they had moon@@ shine , laundry deter@@ gents and liquid nails .
this is a beautiful project by Ralph Bor@@ land , who &apos;s South African .
they range from this fluffy toy that is about hugging you -- because autistic children like to be hugged tight , so it has a spring inside -- all the way to this doll with a mirror so the child can see him or herself in the mirror and regain a sense of self .
so they &apos;re quite beautiful , but they &apos;re beautiful because they &apos;re so smart and economical .
is the Grand Canyon awesome ?
God doesn &apos;t exist by logic alone unless you believe the onto@@ logical argument , and I hope you don &apos;t , because it &apos;s not a good argument .
now , if you &apos;re a Buddhist , you might want to stop right there , because essentially what you &apos;ve got is nothing = the world , and by symmetry of identity , that means the world = nothing . okay ?
so this is a problem , believe it or not , that reflective physicists really think a lot about , and at this point they tend to go metaphysical , say , well , maybe the set of laws that describes our universe , it &apos;s just one set of laws and it describes one part of reality , but maybe every consistent set of laws describes another part of reality , and in fact all possible physical worlds really exist , they &apos;re all out there .
Steven We@@ in@@ berg , the father of the standard model of particle physics , has actually flir@@ ted with this idea himself , that all possible realities actually exist .
we have sheer nothingness on one side , and we have this vision of a reality that encompasses every conceivable world at the other extreme : the fullest possible reality , nothingness , the simplest possible reality .
but if it &apos;s just one of these random , generic realities , there &apos;s no further explanation for it .
so my choices are meaningless .
inside , the House of Life is bustling as usual with scri@@ bes , priests , doctors , and students .
she has read about ailments like this , but never seen one .
now , if you &apos;re my five-year-old , your Internet consists mostly of puppies and fairies and occasionally fairies riding puppies .
it &apos;s no longer the case that a few powerful elites control all the media and the rest of us are just passive receivers .
so that was what needed to be challenged .
and that was clearer to me in the course of looking at his life and understanding , as they say , the Native Americans say , &quot; Do not criticize the man until you can walk in his mo@@ c@@ ca@@ sins . &quot;

and the central idea of this work is that the human mind and brain is not a single , gener@@ al-@@ purpose processor , but a collection of highly specialized components , each solving a different specific problem , and yet collectively making up who we are as human beings and thinkers .
in fact , it &apos;s my brain .
look at my face .
so I went through all of these details about the face region to show you what it takes to really establish that a part of the brain is selectively involved in a specific mental process .
the brain could have been a single , gener@@ al-@@ purpose processor , more like a kitchen knife than a Swiss Army knife .
and if we did want to go or travel to un@@ habitual places in space -- to that banana peel spot that conf@@ uses us ; to that place outside our vertical comfort zone , where we encounter unexpected turbulence and get accelerated oddly , where the ground changes and moves out from under us -- like the composer who is trying to hit a note higher than the human voice can sing , he inv@@ ents a pic@@ col@@ o or a flute , I set about the invention of my protot@@ yp@@ ic machines .
now we have our very own mason jar in William@@ sburg , Brooklyn .

he &apos;s the author of seven books , six of them on Mayan ceramics .
I can &apos;t move my body to the beat , and after a scientist who became a philosopher , I have to talk about hard science .
usually , talking about science is like exercising in a dry place .

what do we have in South America that is different ?
it &apos;s a bit dry and rough , but we are floating here , and there is this invisible river running above us .

it &apos;s Hu@@ di@@ ks@@ v@@ all . it &apos;s a city in northern Sweden .
it gave me a very biased view of how life is on this planet .
of course you shouldn &apos;t .
now , the next preconceived idea is first countries and people need to be very , very rich to get the social development like girls in school and be ready for natural disasters .
that &apos;s a rule of thumb .
in 1975 , only 30 percent of them lived outside EU and North America .
and - ( Laughter ) - she went tru@@ dging through the i@@ vy , and then her eyes just got so wide , and she pointed out this melon that was bigger than her head , and then all the kids ran over there and rushed around her , and one of the kids was like , &quot; Hey , why is there a sticker on this ? &quot;
they have eye@@ patches in lots of colors , because when it &apos;s spring@@ time , pirates want to go wild .
and the store , strangely , people came to them and bought things , and they ended up paying the rent for our tutoring center , which was behind it , but to me , more important was the fact that I think the quality of work you do , kids would come and get instruction in writing , and when you have to walk this weird , liminal , fictional space like this to go do your writing , it &apos;s going to affect the kind of work that you make .
as I reflect on this success I &apos;ve encountered with the Has@@ ini effect , I keep coming back to the people that I was fortunate enough to work with .
collaboration is the superpower that I turn to , to help me fight cancer .
over the next two decades , we &apos;ll see the demand for energy rise by 40 percent , and the growth in the economy and in the population is putting increasing pressure on our land , on our water and on our forests .

it &apos;s all different , and it &apos;s a function of your leg length and your back and the contours of your back , and if I were to put sensors , maybe 100 sensors into all of your chairs right now , I could create an index that &apos;s fairly unique to you , sort of like a fingerprint , but it &apos;s not your finger .
the male-@@ dominated field made my presence un@@ welcome by all possible means .

they will not be solved unless people who live in cities , like most of us , actually start doing a better job , because right now , we are not doing a very good one .
they have also , to a lesser extent , invited people to participate in improving the outcome of decisions that were already made for them , just like my mom when I was eight and she told me that I had a choice : I had to be in bed by 8 p.m. , but I could choose my pink pajamas or my blue pajamas .
I have reason to believe that it &apos;s possible for citizens to build their own structures of participation .

over the last four years , business has grown double digits , whilst child mortality has reduced in all the places where soap use has increased .
just as personal computers or the Internet or smartphones leveled the playing field for entrepreneurship , politics or education , recent advances have leveled it up for biotech progress as well , and that is allowing multidisciplinary teams like ours to try to tackle and look at these problems with new approaches .
so imagine trying to differentiate two molecules , extremely similar , extremely small .

we don &apos;t live in the era of legal segregation .
so as businesspeople , as consumers , as patients , as citizens , we have a responsibility , I think , to spend more time focusing on our critical thinking skills .
why ? because they &apos;re based on assumptions about who we all are based on our gender and our age and where we live as opposed to data on what we actually think and do .

about 12 years ago , I gave up my career in banking to try to make the world a safer place .
if you asked most people 10 years ago if an end to the War on Drugs was possible , they would have laughed .
drugs are cheaper and more available than ever , and consumption has risen globally .

detached houses , 30 families could be accommodated .
what we said was , what if , instead of thinking of 40 square meters as a small house , why don &apos;t we consider it half of a good one ?

( Laughter ) And they said , &quot; No , no , no , we want to see the kite . &quot;
so we quickly installed a kite way up high on the hill , so that you could see the boy flying the kite and you could actually see a kite .
and we had an opportunity to try that out in a community in the central part of Rio , which is called Santa Mar@@ ta , and we made a design for this place which looked like this , and then we got people to go along with it because turns out that if your idea is ridiculously big , it &apos;s easier to get people to go along with this . ( Laughter ) And the people of Santa Mar@@ ta got together and in a little over a month they turned that square into this .
du : so then we received an unexpected phone call from the Philadelphia M@@ ural Arts Program , and they had this question if this idea , our approach , if this would actually work in North Phil@@ ly , which is one of the poorest neighborhoods in the United States .

if you cut two zeros , it &apos;s much better .
the answer lies over there , in cutting off supply and demand . &quot;

I said that live@@ stream could turn the web into a colossal TV network , but I believe it does something else , because after watching people using it , not only to cover things but to express , to organize themselves politically , I believe live@@ stream can turn cyberspace into a global political arena where everyone might have a voice , a proper voice , because live@@ stream takes the monopoly of the broadcast political discourse , of the verbal aspect of the political dialogue out of the mouths of just politicians and political pundits alone , and it empowers the citizen through this direct and non-@@ mediated power of exchanging experiences and dialogue , empowers them to question and to influence authorities in ways in which we are about to see .
so important was this that in fact the success was covered in The New York Times in a front page article a few weeks later .

and together with other teammates in the National Forest Department , we were assigned a task to join a team and find out the causes of deforestation , and make a plan to combat that at a national level , involving the local governments , the civil society , business , local communities , in an effort that could tackle those causes .
it &apos;s more or less like we are forest heroes , but still deforestation champions .

so I think one of the reasons people are disturbed by destroying books , people don &apos;t want to rip books and nobody really wants to throw away a book , is that we think about books as living things , we think about them as a body , and they &apos;re created to relate to our body , as far as scale , but they also have the potential to continue to grow and to continue to become new things .
and I think that &apos;s what &apos;s happening with books now , now that most of our technology , most of our information , most of our personal and cultural records are in digital form , I think it &apos;s really allowing the book to become something new .
and then I started yelling things .

but once again , it wasn &apos;t super easy , because this data was not on the open data portal .
and let &apos;s adopt and share some open data standards .
you could dow@@ se for all sorts of things , but this particular one was built to dow@@ se for marijuana in students &apos; lockers .
sort of an interesting thing .
so without a theory of planetary rings and with only gra@@ iny data , you can &apos;t have a good theory .
( Laughter ) Dis@@ covered by a Tennessee baker in 1996 .
all these candles , thousands of candles people had lit in tribute to this .
the S@@ ke@@ p@@ tics is a nonprofit educational organization .
it &apos;s a love story -- she &apos;s sort of the Nor@@ ah Jones of the UK -- about how she much loves her guy , and compared to nine million bicycles , and so forth .
and just walking , I found a man who gave me a full scholarship to the United States .
I &apos;m leaving America .
I &apos;m using the knowledge I received from the United States and from my community to move them forward .
I myself have a story in Brazil that people think is an overnight success .
well if , as I do , you have dogs or kids , you probably have some dark suspic@@ ions about that , all of which are true , by the way .
what &apos;s going to happen is that the infant is going to start off as this yellow dot , and you can see that he &apos;s starting off basically in the vaginal community , as we would expect from his delivery mode .
and you can see he &apos;s starting to approach the adult fecal community .
obesity has a really large effect , as it turns out , and today , we can tell whether you &apos;re lean or obese with 90 percent accuracy by looking at the microbes in your gut .
what happens is , they send in their samples , we sequence the DNA of their microbes and then release the results back to them .
so here &apos;s that map of the human microbiome again .
do they now become a burden on the medical system ?
how do they stay competitive ?
a final example from across the world in East Africa : there &apos;s been a huge movement to digitize land ownership rights , for a number of reasons .
as you can see , this is a device up in a tree .
I &apos;ll give you a clear little example , something that people used to do around the turn of the century -- not this century , the other one .
the 10 of hearts ?
and my answer was ...
now , I want you to do exactly the same thing I am about to do .
and just like that , very clearly , I want to make sure that we place this in full view from the beginning of this experience and to make sure that everyone is going to see it , we &apos;re going to actually have a camera man onstage .
in the serial number , there is a letter .
jails are actually supposed to rehabil@@ itate a person , not cause him or her to become more angry , frustrated , and feel more hopeless .

( Laughter ) And each performer got three minutes to perform and then random audience members would hold up scorec@@ ards , and they would end up with a numerical score , and what this meant is , it kind of broke down the barrier between performer and audience and encouraged the kind of connection with the listener .
proper pop-up purple paper people .
but I wouldn &apos;t wanna deal with all the paper people politics .
there &apos;d be a little paper me . and a little paper you .
people who are capable of genuine forgiveness .
but that &apos;s when Little Miss Sunshine came along Singing her favorite song about how we &apos;re made to be strong , And you don &apos;t have to be wrong to belong , Just be true to who you are , because we are all stars at heart .
it was the first project funded by AR@@ PA .
the people who supported it were the Air Force , which meant that it was all secret .

keep your hands up , if you know who this is .
when many of us think about innovation , though , we think about an Einstein having an &apos; Aha ! &apos; moment .
pilots are often about being right .
instead they spend their time thinking about , &quot; How do we design a studio that has the sensibility of a public square so that people will interact ?
Thank you .
this is why I am here today with you .
we were using armored vehicles , deco@@ y cars , changing patterns of travel , changing homes , all sorts of security measures .
we can &apos;t do otherwise .
you &apos;ve heard about that concept : responsibility to Pro@@ tect .
humanitarian principles are tested , questioned , and often ignored , but perhaps more importantly , we have abandoned the search for justice .
my answer was very simple : if I had quit , that would have meant my kidn@@ apper had won .
you know those fluorescent lights and the endless corridors and those rows of uncomfortable chairs .
and when this was first built , there were protests in the local village .
some said three .
the other symptoms could come from the first slide or from those on the second slide , including symptoms like feeling out of control and changes in sleep or appetite .
research tells us that the more a woman believes that everyone gets PMS , the more likely she is to erron@@ e@@ ously report that she has it .
when women are prescribed drugs like anti-@@ depress@@ ants or hormones , medical protocol requires that they have physician follow-up every three months .
pharmaceutical companies reap untold profits when women are convinced they should take a prescribed medication for all of their child-@@ bearing lives .
but you can &apos;t sense any of those by yourself , at least not yet , because you don &apos;t come equipped with the proper sensors .
but the question is , do we have to be stuck there ?
so we already know that we can marry our technology to our biology , because there are hundreds of thousands of people walking around with artificial hearing and artificial vision .
it &apos;s just what we have inherited from a complex road of evolution .
de : now , he &apos;s not doing this -- ( Applause ) -- Jonathan is not doing this consciously , because the patterns are too complicated , but his brain is starting to unlock the pattern that allows it to figure out what the data mean , and our expectation is that , after wearing this for about three months , he will have a direct perceptual experience of hearing in the same way that when a blind person passes a finger over bra@@ ille , the meaning comes directly off the page without any conscious intervention at all .
( Laughter ) And the feedback is telling him whether he did the right thing or not .
actually , this was the first time I felt applause on the vest .
so that stock market experiment .
and could we be inspired by Hollywood and come up with ways to actually try to get this to work ?
and in fact , if we could grow really fast , we could also start using materials that are self-@@ curing , and we could have amazing properties .
( Laughter ) I know , right ?
you know what his unsuccessful pickup line was ?
yep . that &apos;s what I thought .
for the past eight months , the mysterious content of these tapes has hung like the sword of Da@@ mo@@ cles over my head .
a few days later , Tyler jumped from the George Washington Bridge to his death .
a meta-@@ analysis done out of the Netherlands showed that for the first time , cyber@@ bullying was leading to suicidal ide@@ ations more significantly than offline bullying .
for nearly two decades now , we have slowly been so@@ wing the seeds of shame and public humiliation in our cultural soil , both on@@ - and offline .
this shift has created what Professor Nicol@@ aus Mills calls &quot; a culture of humiliation . &quot;
we &apos;re in a dangerous cycle .
anyone who is suffering from shame and public humiliation needs to know one thing : you can survive it .
that &apos;s a lot of training examples .
we were fairly alone on this journey for quite a while .
the real challenge is to go from three to 13 and far beyond .
after he was shot , Raisuddin &apos;s life grew no easier .
it won &apos;t be solved by tweeting harder , building sli@@ cker apps , or starting one more artisanal coffee ro@@ a@@ sting service .

so this space we converted into what we call Black C@@ ine@@ ma House .
in some ways , the bank represents a hub , that we &apos;re trying to create a pretty hardcore node of cultural activity , and that if we could start to make multiple hubs and connect some cool green stuff around there , that the buildings that we &apos;ve purchased and reha@@ bbed , which is now around 60 or 70 units , that if we could land miniature Ver@@ sa@@ illes on top of that , and connect these buildings by a beautiful green@@ belt -- ( Applause ) -- that this place where people never wanted to be would become an important destination for folk from all over the country and world .
and so someone has to do that work .
like every other human being , I avoided trouble .
we pretended . we all became smart co@@ wards .
the images that I took were just a number to many Kenyans .
StoryCorps speaks to our mortality .
I thought I couldn &apos;t believe in StoryCorps any more deeply than I did , but it was at that moment that I fully and visc@@ erally grasp@@ ed the importance of making these recordings .
now , no one has to wait anymore .
and software was and still is a madd@@ en@@ ingly hard-to-@@ control activity , so that was enormously valuable .
that was programming in the early 1960s .
( Laughter ) Evi@@ dently , wandering around the nursery was not a problem for me without eyes .
okay , now keep your eyes closed because , did you hear the difference ?
the second is the nature of the virus .
so they are absolutely ready to go .
Napoleon got a few things wrong ; he got this one absolutely right .
that &apos;s a terrible story .
Kepler &apos;s data reveals planets &apos; sizes as well as their distance from their parent star .

E@@ vel &apos;s riding the amazing stunt cycle .
I was there . E@@ vel Kni@@ ev@@ el was my friend .

and when you &apos;re sitting there in her room , watching her , you &apos;re not watching it through a television screen , you &apos;re not watching it through a window , you &apos;re sitting there with her .
usually we don &apos;t think .
and it &apos;s a beautiful definition , because if you &apos;re wealthy , you might want the wealthy to have more money , the poor to have less .
but if you &apos;re going to go into that society in every possible situation , and you don &apos;t know , you have to consider all the aspects .
and here is what we got .
then we have the desir@@ ability gap .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Fol@@ ks , this is sha@@ ker cup juggling . it &apos;s not a show@@ stopp@@ er but it certainly slows it down .
BF : you don &apos;t want to hold these , trust me .
now , we risked Richard &apos;s life , it &apos;s only fair we risk our own lives .
DH : tell them about our bio and stuff .
too much Olympics .
we are only 20 , 30 , 40 kilometers away from the comet .
they &apos;re just like you and me .
now , when we got out of hiber@@ nation in January 2014 , we started arriving at a distance of two million kilometers from the comet in May .
we don &apos;t know , so there is a lot to investigate .
now , on a bit of a com@@ ical note here is that originally Rosetta was designed to have a lander which would bounce .
this is one of the iconic images of Rosetta .
the boy on the branch , he loves the tree so he is eating the tree .
when you put many children in a quiet box , some of them get really nervous .
you know , it &apos;s completely open .
I thought that if I keep on freeing 10 children , and 50 more will join , that &apos;s not done .
later on , I cofounded the world &apos;s single largest civil society campaign for education that is the Global Campaign for Education .
because if the top 10 percent of American families own 90 percent of the stocks , as they take a greater share of corporate profits , then there &apos;s less wealth left for the rest of society .
and if we were going to find life on those moons and planets , then we would answer questions such as , are we alone in the solar system ?
so clearly , those two planets may have been seeded by the same material .
our most recent rover on Mars has discovered traces of organ@@ ics .
all together , they are telling us what started as a microbial pathway , and why what started as a microbial pathway sometimes ends up as a civilization or sometimes ends up as a dead end .
Hi . I &apos;m going to talk to you today about laughter , and I just want to start by thinking about the first time I can ever remember noticing laughter .
and the thing you have to remember about the English is , of course , we do have an immensely sophisticated sense of humor .
so in fact , when you look at close relationships , laughter is a phenomen@@ ally useful index of how people are regulating their emotions together .
( Laughter ) He &apos;s starting to go now .
they &apos;re bi@@ zz@@ ar@@ re , they &apos;re beautiful , and there &apos;s very little we know about them .
and Gri@@ sel@@ da &apos;s not the only one .
a woman in Oregon recently experienced what this would be like .
what does that look like ?
and it doesn &apos;t have to be this way .
I hope we can say that we had compassion , that we raised our voice , and as a generation , we were moved to make the violence stop .
( Applause )
why couldn &apos;t I put jelly beans in my o@@ at@@ meal ?
can you agree on anything ? &quot;
yet , when I started graduate school , no one knew what these genes were .
I went to the greenhouse and I saw that the conventional variety that was flooded for 18 days had died , but the rice variety that we had genetically engineered with a new gene we had discovered , called Sub@@ 1 , was alive .
but we know that some insecticides are very harmful to human health , especially when farmers and their families cannot afford proper protection , like these children .
( Applause ) Thank you .
Chris Anderson : powerfully argued .
Hey , yeah !
when the A.I. becomes superintelligent , it realizes that the most effective way to get the solution to this problem is by transforming the planet into a giant computer , so as to increase its thinking capacity .
and so in order to be able to access the brain , you really need to dedicate your life and spend six and a half years as a graduate student just to become a neuroscientist to get access to these tools .
a few years ago , we started a company called B@@ ack@@ yard Bra@@ ins and we make DIY neuroscience equipment and I brought some here tonight , and I want to do some demonstrations .
GG : okay , do it again ? MG : a little bit .
( audio ) Mary had a little lamb whose fle@@ ece was white as snow , and everywhere that Mary went , that lamb was sure to go .
the other kid was fine the next day , I think it was his pride that was injured more than anything .

it had to be dug out .
this is not my home .
because it &apos;s hollow , it &apos;s lightweight , light enough to be lifted by just a few men , or , apparently , one woman .
the structural connections of our buildings are reinforced by steel joints , but we use a lot of hand-@@ whit@@ tled bamboo pins .
and this is also what my patient Heather is telling me , when she &apos;s talking to me about her story with Nick .
but it can be healed .
RM : all right , got it ? here we go .
the flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory .
when I left , a guy passed me who had a Chicago flag badge on his backpack .
RM : underneath the phoenix , there &apos;s a motto on a ribbon that translates to &quot; Gold in peace , iron in war , &quot; plus -- and this is the big problem -- it says San Francisco across the bottom .
as we move more and more into cities , the city flag will become not just a symbol of that city as a place , but also , it could become a symbol of how that city considers design itself , especially today , as the popul@@ ace is becoming more design@@ -@@ aware .
now , I read Peter Singer &apos;s book in 1980 , when I had a full head of lush , brown hair , and indeed I was moved by it , because I had become a lawyer because I wanted to speak for the voiceless , defend the defen@@ seless , and I &apos;d never realized how voiceless and defen@@ seless the trillions , billions of nonhuman animals are .
and so in the fall of 17@@ 71 , James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stewart .
they have a symbolic culture .
it &apos;s easy to see frozen fingers and cold wet@@ suits and even the struggle that it took just to get there , but most of all , what I see is just joy .
I also gave them the weekly assignment of writing a personal letter , to anybody .
I had to leave without a proper goodbye .
she went each week to physical therapy , but just like me , she barely followed the home treatment , and it took her over five months to feel better .
let &apos;s see how this looks .
she can see how much I moved , how many points I scored , with what speed I moved my joints , and so on .
we ended up at Children &apos;s National Medical Center in Washington , D.C .
but finally , for 25,000 dollars and agreement to pay 10 percent of any revenues we might ever get , they agreed to give me worldwide rights to this drug .
we &apos;re so lucky to be born in the time that sequencing genomes is a routine activity , and the brilliant folks at Syn@@ thetic Genomics are able to zero in on the pig genome , find exactly the genes that are problematic , and fix them .
( Applause )
the second question that we often think about is : are we alone ?
there &apos;s a special patch of the sky where we have thousands of planets .
so , we went back to the drawing board and we think we have found something very interesting in another field .
and that results in the ridiculously detrimental lack of diversity in our workforce , particularly in areas of influence .
but , if the merit idea was true , why would identical resu@@ mes , in an experiment done in 2012 by Yale , identical resu@@ mes sent out for a lab technician , why would Jenni@@ fers be deemed less competent , be less likely to be offered the job , and be paid less than Johns .
in almost every case , you get the same result .
wizards , techno-@@ whiz@@ zes , believe that science and technology , properly applied , will let us produce our way out of our dilemmas .
wizards envision all 10 billion of us packed into ultra@@ dense but walkable megacities , an urbanized world of maximum human aspiration and maximum human liberty .
more people live in the countryside in this vision , with power provided by neighbor@@ hoo@@ d-@@ scale solar and wind installations that disappear into the background .
now , wizards regard all this as hoo@@ ey .
they &apos;re a fantasy .
they should be saying , all of this , wizards , prophets , it &apos;s a pipe dream .
these are just ideas from a random journalist .
O@@ sma@@ k@@ ac also had schiz@@ o@@ affective disorder .
so the data has since been used by groups like Human Rights Watch on its recent report on these types of sting operations .
is everything before and after that utterly irrelevant ?
and then when you land there , in C@@ hu@@ kot@@ ka are the C@@ hu@@ k@@ ch@@ is .
from a few bones , we infer the existence of dinos@@ u@@ ars .
and it starts with a problem of conf@@ ounded evidence that all of us have , which is that we are part of the world .
this is not an electron micro@@ graph ; this is just a regular phot@@ om@@ ic@@ ro@@ graph .
I think that can be changed by building combin@@ atorial vaccines in advance .
as humans , our babies are uniquely dependent .
except now , we have to look for this little sticker .
now , habituation isn &apos;t always bad .
he just wanted a comfortable shower .
it was great , and it worked .
thermostat designers decided to add a new step .
so what did we do ?
with that custom little screw , there was just one screw in the box , that was easy to mount and put on the wall .
because human trafficking is far more prevalent , complex and close to home than most of us realize .
we &apos;ve mostly turned to the criminal justice system .
I wasn &apos;t the only person grappling with these issues .
in the 18@@ 80s , anthropologists began to collect them as evidence of American Indian religion .
but from another point of view , the museum had committed a terrible crime of cultural violence .
but in college , I came to learn that my future career had a dark history .
he later told me , &quot; It hurts my heart to see the A@@ hay@@ u : da so far away .
after things were quickly under control , I immediately called a meeting in the school &apos;s auditorium to introduce myself as the school &apos;s new principal .
anybody who &apos;s ever worked with me will tell you I am known for my slogans .
all during the school day .
( Applause ) We have a very long way to go , a very long way to go , but we now approach every obstacle with a &quot; So What . now What ? &quot; attitude .
of course not .
if you see a snake , don &apos;t pick it up .
we all see a cube because we all , each one of us , constructs the cube that we see .
brains and neurons have no causal powers .
yes , BERT , yes , I read about it .
she was interviewed whilst marching in full carni@@ val head@@ dress and very little else .
( Laughter ) So one woman at the university here in Dublin , she wrote about me .
of course , men were having sex as well , but you &apos;ll remember from the reading , what were male slu@@ ts called ?
my brothers who I &apos;m close to , those guys , they &apos;re all like me .
and the valence is actually quite negative , so you must have been a big fan .
it &apos;s a valuable awareness of im@@ perman@@ ence , both a kind of gentle , transient sadness as things pass by in life , but also a deeper , softly lingering sadness about the im@@ perman@@ ence of all reality .
so what do artists do ? well , what artists do is to measure .
it goes straight . that &apos;s a big revelation for nine-@@ year-olds .
who &apos;s got the apple ?
student 2 : what did you get ? what did you get ?
teacher : so put &quot; sponge ball &quot; ...
by the time my generation walked the streets , dis@@ investment at the local , state and federal level , eroded infrastructure , and the War on Drugs dismantled my family and community .
the history of a place is written on the body and the landscape .
( Applause )
all analysis was gone , adrenaline brain kicked in , and I just yanked the spines out .
( Laughter ) No more disasters . no . just the opposite , in fact .
( cheers and applause ) Yeah .
would I brush off that comment , take a million pictures , and not be distracted for an instant from the pure joy of that moment , and by doing that , walk out with the shame that comes up for not standing up for myself , especially in front of my niece .
so teams that work together longer get better , because it takes time to develop the trust you need for real can@@ dor and openness .
( Applause )
so he didn &apos;t tell them about the circus , or about how he wrestled professionally on evenings and weekends .
he was a wrest@@ ler ; he was a doctor .
it &apos;d change modern medicine so much so , that decades later , Time magazine would call him pain relief &apos;s founding father .
they folded sa@@ mos@@ as for our entire mosque .
for decades , the prevalence estimates remained stable at just three or four children in 10,000 .
that &apos;s actually not surprising , because Kanner &apos;s criteria for diagnosing autism were incredibly selective .
but hopefully , it was said with enough conviction that it was at least all@@ ur@@ ingly mysterious .
and so I went back to the drawing board , as I often do .
but part of what makes it so hear@@ tening to me as a designer is that he &apos;s taken the visual vernacular of Diet Coke -- the typefaces , the colors , the silver background -- and he &apos;s reduced them to their most essential parts , so it &apos;s like going back to the Charlie Brown face .
people who got infections either recovered , if they were lucky , or they died .
we could build surveillance systems to tell us where resistance is emerging next .
we don &apos;t trash the environment or court devastating accidents or expose others to the possibility of cancer , because we decided those things were expensive , destructive , not in our best interest .
and in the lab , we were asking the question , &quot; What are the biological differences between the brains of individuals who would be diagnosed as normal control , as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia , schiz@@ o@@ affective or bipolar disorder ? &quot;
we are energy-@@ beings connected to one another through the consciousness of our right hemispheres as one human family .
so here I am in this space , and my job , and any stress related to my job -- it was gone .
and when ?
it &apos;s kind of unbelievable .
it &apos;s unbelievable .
so by just making the cars incrementally smarter , we &apos;re probably not going to see the wins we really need .
now , if we look at the bottom left corner here , this is your classic car .
let &apos;s spend some time talking about how the car sees the world .
so what we &apos;re looking at is the scene with the cyclist again , and you might notice in the bottom , we can &apos;t actually see the cyclist yet , but the car can : it &apos;s that little blue box up there , and that comes from the laser data .
it &apos;s not too stressful . we can concentrate .
now you have white knuc@@ kles and you &apos;re gripping the steering wheel .
but you &apos;re not a passenger .
but I did the math , and I realized that my great-grandfather had been born exactly 1@@ 18 years before that year , and I sat on his knee until I was 11 years old , and I realized it &apos;s nothing in time , nor in history .
it was vital in the transition , but what fascinated me was , in the transition to what ? what could actually work ?
many schools of thought fed our thinking and pointed to this model : industrial symbiosis , performance economy , sharing economy , biomimicry , and of course , cra@@ d@@ le-@@ to-@@ cradle design .
maybe we wouldn &apos;t buy light fit@@ t@@ ings , but we &apos;d pay for the service of light , and the manufacturers would recover the materials and change the light fit@@ t@@ ings when we had more efficient products .
and then later , when she gets married , the same cutter goes in and opens the ori@@ fice up so she can have sex .
for every male arrested for illegal sex trade , 25 women are arrested in the United States of America .
these are the kind of things that go on .
so what is the basic thing that we need to do today ?
and if you don &apos;t know them , that &apos;s okay . most casual players probably do .
and despite all the difficulties with the right spati@@ ot@@ emp@@ oral features we have been able to do that .
and it turns out the answer is yes .
a gentleman named Le@@ B@@ ron James came up and he took a three to tie .
which could literally be happening any second now .
I later found out that when the gate was opened on a garden , a wild sta@@ g stampe@@ ded along the path and ran straight into me .
but that &apos;s a whole other story .
and I respect them .
and I &apos;m now one of three members of the public who has a seat at the table -- not because I &apos;m different , but because my voice counts , just like anybody else .
so I &apos;ll read it to you .
the image on the right is the only illustration that Darwin included in &quot; The Origin of Species , &quot; which Darwin called the &quot; Tree of Life . &quot;
an &quot; are you with us or against us ? &quot; stance takes root .
one way is to listen closely .
we needed a new framework that could hold all the experiences that we were hearing on our tal@@ k-@@ line .
if someone is talking about their own personal experience , use the words that they use .
and it generates the empathy that we need to overcome all the ways that we try to hurt one another .
but with these advances , and working with our immune system to help build tissue and heal wounds , we could begin seeing products on the market that work with our body &apos;s defense system to help us regenerate , and maybe one day be able to keep pace with a salamander .
lucky for you , she &apos;s here .
so at the Mur@@ ab@@ it School of International Affairs , we go very heavy on the debate , and rule number one is do your research , so that &apos;s what I did , and it surprised me how easy it was to find women in my faith who were leaders , who were innovative , who were strong -- politically , economically , even milit@@ arily .
totally legally , all of those bottles of water could be bottles of vodka , right ?
you &apos;re not going to do that , and the reason you &apos;re not going to do that is not because anyone &apos;s stopping you .
the most obvious implications are for the War on Drugs .
but I increasingly began to think that the connections we have or think we have , are like a kind of parody of human connection .
it &apos;ll be your flesh and blood friends who you have deep and nuanced and tex@@ tured , face-to-face relationships with , and there &apos;s a study I learned about from Bill Mc@@ Ki@@ b@@ ben , the environmental writer , that I think tells us a lot about this .
I think all along we should have been singing love songs to them , because the opposite of addiction is not so@@ bri@@ ety .
I first met them at a retirement home in Los Angeles , where I had been photographing for three years .
but also with Will , who made me aware of the divide in me .
and it was an amazing learning experience because , for me , human rights have been something in which I had , you know , a part-time interest , but , mainly , it was something that happened to other people over there .
but I got a phone call from Bono in 1985 and , as you know , he &apos;s a great singer , but he &apos;s a magnificent hu@@ st@@ ler , and -- ( Laughter ) -- a very hard guy to say no to , and he was saying , you know , just after I &apos;d done the Bi@@ ko song , we &apos;re going to do a tour for Amnesty , you have to be on it , and really that was the first time that I &apos;d been out and started meeting people who &apos;d watched their family being shot in front of them , who &apos;d had a partner thrown out of an airplane into an ocean , and suddenly this world of human rights arrived in my world , and I couldn &apos;t really walk away in quite the same way as before .
the other soldier also came .
the one who was de@@ filing me then left me and went to rape Evelyn .
that &apos;s four separate steps versus typing and then touching and typing and just doing it all in one motion -- or one-@@ and-a-half , depending on how you want to count .
here &apos;s another step-by-step procedure , only in this case -- NN : okay , this movie is ... Everybody &apos;s heard of sound-@@ sync movies -- this is tex@@ t-@@ sync movies , so as the movie plays , the text gets highlighted .
( Laughter ) Now , as someone who fl@@ os@@ ses twice a day , I wasn &apos;t really sure that that was fl@@ os@@ sing more but I don &apos;t think I said that out loud .
the physical exterior reveals a crack in which you can get a glimpse at a more fragile interior .
( Laughter ) At least , according to a 1973 &quot; Book of Li@@ sts &quot; survey which preceded all those online best , worst , funniest lists that you see today .
so , no , that &apos;s not the point .
well , what difference does this make ?
and the idea is that what &apos;s true for a person will also be true for the white rat .
and females as a kind of variant -- something special that you only study after you get the basics down .
maybe it would win him some salvation .
you stood up because the book actually puts the spotlight on sha@@ mers .
it &apos;s true that I had teachers that didn &apos;t give up on me , and I was very fortunate to have those teachers , because I often gave them cause to think there was no reason to invest in me .
this fabrication of place could be one of the world &apos;s greatest achievements , because no one belongs here ; everyone does .
we organized ourselves to take a young man on a road trip across the United States .
in particular , the Higgs field helps explain why it &apos;s so weak .
and as an adult , re-@@ finding these communities has re-@@ introduced me to a community of learners , and has encouraged me to continue to be a learner even in my adulthood , so that I no longer feel like learning is something reserved for the young .
they have complicated names , but let &apos;s just call them X and Y .
you &apos;ve probably heard of it , and it &apos;s manufactured as a drug that has completely changed how we treat diabetes .
so could we take those molecules and make them parts of new amino acids that , when incorporated into a protein , are guided by that protein to their target ?
at the beginning of this talk I told you that we reported in 2014 the creation of semisynthetic organisms that store more information , X and Y , in their DNA .
I remember when I was a boy in school , my teacher assigned us this classic civics assignment where you take a sheet of paper and you write a member of your government .
( Laughter ) OK , so I &apos;d like each of you to look under your chairs .
we want to believe -- I want to believe -- that there is something special about me , about my body , about my brain , that makes me so superior to a dog or a pig , or a chimpanzee .
there is basically just one way in which a beehive can function .
one versus one , or even 10 versus 10 , chimpanzees might be better than us .
all other animals use their communication system only to describe reality .
no way !
but it wasn &apos;t all fun .
about a seven-@@ minute drive from my hidden lake cabin was the compound of Ar@@ yan Nations , the white supremacist group .
we are not white supre@@ m@@ acists . we are white separ@@ ati@@ sts .
( Laughter ) In@@ deed , most white people in Whitopia are neither white supre@@ m@@ acists or white separ@@ ati@@ sts ; in fact , they &apos;re not there for explicitly racial reasons at all .
I practice law here .
and you know what they found out ?
and businesses can do it in three simple ways .
our nation &apos;s highways , airports and truck stops are literally used as modern-day slave routes .
together , we can all protect our children , we can educate the work@@ forces around us and improve society , where we all live and work with John .
all of this , despite cost-effective solutions existing .
my wife and I managed to raise the funds to cover her treatment , but situations like Theresa were common every day , where people had the wrong diseases .
I had never known this .
I was concerned about making a place for the study of law .
so , it was an accidental discovery .
and it seemed to work as a way to put he and I together .
and the building is very sculptural as you walk around it .
this is the city hall over here somewhere , and the courthouse .
she wanted a dome somewhere in the house .
the landscape is being built around to create a private garden .
there &apos;s a new library across the river .
the acou@@ sti@@ cian in the competition gave us criteria , which led to this compartment@@ alized scheme , which we found out after the competition would not work at all .
it &apos;s a ki@@ va , and Larry &apos;s putting some water in there , and it works much better than a fish .
and we split these bridges .
for people with A@@ SD -- it has been speculated that many innovative scientists , researchers , artists , and engineers have it ; like , for example , Emily Dickinson , Jane Austen , Isaac Newton , and Bill Gates are some examples .
but that can also have the unfortunate effect of making your mind go blank during a test .
and the way this looks is shown in this graph .
a nanometer is a billionth of a meter .
the puzzle , the mystery was : how does it do it ?
Thank you .
sounds familiar ?
but what is it , exactly ?
we have to stop waiting until we see evidence of a disease becoming a global threat before we consider it as one .
number two : we must embrace the lived experience and our histories , and we must make sure we never go back to a place where we cannot move forward .
so they needed to understand what was going on .
and if you don &apos;t have a port , you don &apos;t have a way to get in enough relief supplies to support a population .
it &apos;s kind of weird .
each one is an archive of our culture , through our rip@@ pe@@ d-up media and matter , whether it &apos;s encyclopedias or dictionaries or magazines .
and in particular , there &apos;s one rather strange one , in the most elegant unified theories we have .
and I &apos;ll just show you one .
we want to add entrepreneurship and policy skills .
it &apos;s kind of a magic place , the mountain .
it &apos;s no exaggeration to say that the Southern Hemisphere is going to be the future of astronomy for the 21st century .
it &apos;s comparable to the size of the Statue of Liberty .
so , keep your eyes on those bright images again .
extraordinary precision .
we need more clarity , we need to clarify the roles , the processes .
but the blood , the energy that will be in your throat will not be in your legs .
the first thing you will notice on signing up to one of these sites is how familiar it looks .
CA : it led to you publishing a famous paper together .
&#91; Her@@ mann &#93; Min@@ k@@ ow@@ ski had this geometry , and Einstein realized , &quot; Hey ! it &apos;s the very thing in which I can cast general relativity . &quot;
everything is gri@@ st for the mill -- except hem lengths .
so you have to keep on top of the business .
CA : five and 44 .
I don &apos;t think we should worry about it too much .
that math actually works ?
( Laughter ) You may be asking yourselves that very question .
why , if this is so obvious , why is it that for the overwhelming majority of people on the planet , the work they do has none of the characteristics that get us up and out of bed and off to the office every morning ?
why is it that as capitalism developed , it created a mode of production , of goods and services , in which all the non@@ material satis@@ factions that might come from work were eliminated ?
it doesn &apos;t say that only boxes with even numbers can have red tops , or that a box with a red top must have an even number .
then you see two more boxes turned upside down : one labeled as containing meat , and another as containing onions .
true to the tenets of palliative care , I function as something of a reflective advocate , as much as prescribing physician .
you get group@@ think .
they may be a reaction to bigger trends .
in countries like China , you have the Great Fire@@ wall of China .
but what you had was a partnership and a dialogue , and the dialogue has broken down .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And for the men , what happened for the men , they &apos;d come up to me -- and most times , the men are the ones who have tears in their eyes , it &apos;s very interesting .
and you heard President Carter talk about how Title IX is protected .
money to buy the kids clothes as they were growing .
we have a wide range of beliefs about what that something wrong is .
we must listen to their true stories , their more beautifully complex stories .
we said , OK , let &apos;s have a study group .
gender equality is good for countries .
and I say , &quot; Oh no , in fact , what you have to start calculating is how much gender inequality is already costing you .
their children have lower rates of absen@@ tee@@ ism , higher rates of achievement .
these data were collected over a really long period of time .
my mom was a teacher , my sister became a teacher and after college so many of my friends went into teaching .
so the idea was that we would be working on whatever we &apos;re working on , at 2 : 30 p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you &apos;re doing , or you trade , or you work a little bit later or whatever it is .
let &apos;s sell pirate supplies . &quot; this is the pirate supply store .
you see , this is sort of a sketch I did on a napkin .
it was started with about 12 of my friends , people that I had known for years that were writers in the neighborhood .
there &apos;s a lot of cross-@@ pollination . the only problem , especially for the adults working at Mc@@ Sweeney &apos;s who hadn &apos;t necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up , was that there was just the one bathroom . ( Laughter ) With like 60 kids a day , this is a problem .
so these kids worked harder than they &apos;ve ever worked on anything in their lives , because there was that outside audience , there was Isabel Allende on the other end .
so a few months ago , I was giving a talk at a small liberal arts college , and a student came up to me afterwards and he said , kind of sh@@ y@@ ly , &quot; So , I tried your study , and it didn &apos;t work . &quot;
first of all , to be on the side of those who are suffering most and are most eff@@ ected .
1.3 billion don &apos;t have access to electricity , and they light their homes with kerosene and candles , both of which are dangerous .
so they must develop without emissions , and that is a different kind of problem .
and they had to build structures for peace and security .
but business is not only moving rapidly to the benefits of renewable energy , but is urging politicians to give them more signals , so that they can move even more rapidly .
so , lunch counter moment for young people of the 21st century -- the sort of real human rights issue of the 21st century , because he said it is the greatest challenge to humanity and justice in our world .
and so the first step of our compass is finding out what our unique strengths are .
do we care about the people , our family , health , or is it achievement , success , all this stuff ?
he &apos;s like , &quot; But really , just have fun with this . good luck . &quot;
( Laughter ) And of the 80 people swimming that day , 65 of them were between the ages of nine and 13 .
and the best way to do this is to surround yourself with passionate people .
it became normal , so my thinking went from how could I possibly do this to how could I possibly not .
now , if I &apos;m honest , I knew just what she meant .
tell me you &apos;re from France , and I see what , a set of clich@@ és ?
now , think of your relationships , of the people who shape your days .
and in fact , draining a swamp to make way for agriculture and development was considered the very essence of conservation not too long ago .
so what happens , then , when this bird flies over the Gulf of Mexico into Central America for the winter and then the spring rolls around and it flies back , and it comes back to this : a freshly so@@ dded golf course ?
my parents always said I had an unhealthy relationship with gators .
it is resilient .
the crowd on the day of Wei@@ d@@ mann &apos;s execution was called &quot; un@@ ru@@ ly &quot; and &quot; disgusting &quot; by the press , but that was nothing compared to the untold thousands of people who could now study the action over and over again , free@@ ze-@@ framed in every detail .
you are more the incredible shrinking woman than the Buddhist mystic , ser@@ ene , making do with less .
here every gesture needs intention , is alive with consciousness .
to have come to this place , lived to this moment : im@@ measurable lightness .
so as soon as I completed my education , I brought my family to America .
I earned good money .
my heart was beating for my people , and I didn &apos;t know what to do .
and I knew that at that moment that what I should give to my people is education and health , and that &apos;s what I went after .
but as a leader , you have to hold it together .
meanwhile , my mind began knitting itself back together .
I hoped that my reality would change and someone would see that I had come back to life .
to others , I was the tragically brain-@@ damaged boy who had grown to become a man .
and then in 2012 , we had the Rio + 20 event .
another issue that we really need to grapple with is the issue of well-being and equity .
that , he said , was the central thread which ran through all his teaching and that his disci@@ ples should put into practice all day and every day .
we need to empower people to remember the compassionate ethos , and to give guidelines . this Charter would not be a massive document .
her doctor was called A@@ lo@@ is .
Alzheimer &apos;s now affects 40 million people worldwide .
and together , we &apos;ve managed to identify a critical step in the process and are now testing a new class of drugs which would specifically block this step and stop the disease .
we &apos;re also used to being begin@@ ners , because we &apos;ve been begin@@ ners so many times in the past , and this means that we &apos;re less afraid of trying new things and stepping out of our comfort zones .
( Laughter ) Before becoming a writer , Nor@@ a was a financial planner .
the drug you give to your patients that stops the cancer cells multiplying also stops the newborn neurons being generated in their brain . &quot;
whether he ruled anyone , or even lived at all is , unfortunately , less clear .
but if our goal is to inspire innovation and empower more people to build companies of all sizes , we need a new way to fund those ideas .
and the founders couldn &apos;t stop talking .
and they could take their money and reinvest it , potentially funding more new ideas faster .
some suspect these differ@@ ing multiverse hypotheses may eventually coales@@ ce into a common description , or be replaced by something else .
but what you do know is that that introduction was nothing short of transformative .
it &apos;s worked for some forms of breast cancer , but eventually you run to the ceiling of that approach .
and two , that maybe that , the degeneration or dysfunction of this stem cell is what &apos;s causing oste@@ ochon@@ dr@@ al arthritis , a very common ail@@ ment .

this song is called &quot; Home , &quot; and it &apos;s sort of a &quot; This is where I &apos;m from , nice to meet you all , &quot; kind of song .
so here you &apos;ll see , on the top right , what the robot sees with the camera .
they need to be able to sense and communicate with their neighbors .
but robots flying overhead can easily spot this autonomously and then report to the farmer that he or she has a problem in this section of the orchard .
well , we asked a team of economists at Del@@ o@@ it@@ te who checked and crun@@ ched the numbers , and they came back and said , well , look : if the world &apos;s average wealth goes from $ 14,000 a year to $ 23,000 a year , social progress is going to increase from 61 to 6@@ 2.4 .
because the Social Progress Index also has some very good news .
and now let &apos;s be even b@@ older still .
as cities grew during the industrial revolution , large suburban cemeteries replaced smaller urban chur@@ ch@@ yards .
people visited cemeteries for funerals , but also for annivers@@ aries , holidays , or simply an afternoon outdoors .
why would we ?
in how many life-saving areas of medicine , like cancer and stroke , are there important differences between men and women that we could be utilizing ?
we &apos;ve created a 3@@ 60-@@ degree model of education .
but there &apos;s no going back .
the statue is the reference , and it connects the identity of Leonardo to those three faces .
some of them went back to the 1980s .
now , criminals , like people who raped Natasha and Pamela , often leave their DNA at a crime scene .
so , you do the math about how much that was going to cost .
CM@@ Us aren &apos;t solitary confinement , but they radically restrict all of these to levels that meet or exceed the most extreme prisons in the United States .
their phone calls can be limited to 45 minutes a month , compared to the 300 minutes other prisoners receive .
it turned out that one of the people involved in the loan was trying to enlist someone else in a fake attack .
but that might be because the government hasn &apos;t fully explained why some prisoners end up in a CMU , and who is responsible for these decisions .
out of each leg of the wetsuit there were sticking two white bones .
Mouaz studied to become an electrical engineer at the University of Damascus .
this was after the fall of Gaddafi , but before Libya turned into full-blown civil war .
this was the third trip .

it &apos;s a mechanism that allows cells to record , over time , the viruses they have been exposed to .
is there a possible split happening in the science community about this ?

French sign language was brought to America during the early 1800s , and as time went by , mixed with local signs , it evolved into the language we know today as ASL .
and I &apos;m always waiting in eager nervous anticipation around sound , about what &apos;s to come next .
can you please follow along with me ?
and the community that once welcomed them there had become weary of them .

( Laughter ) BG : Franc@@ es@@ co , gra@@ zie . FS : gra@@ zie .
what &apos;s new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis .
but it &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t move around much , not so good for things that move around .
if you design@@ ate a spot and you &apos;re scru@@ pul@@ ous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them .
and at some point , all of us are going to be in that position , where we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one , to help them with a decision .
it &apos;s for the number needed to treat .
now , what is this , the N@@ NT ?
so we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situations .
and the crisis counselor gets the girl to give her her address , because if you &apos;re texting a text line , you want help .
so they were very shocked , because this is the water they drink , this is the water they bathe in , this is the water they fish in -- this is the place where they live .
and , you know , it &apos;s no accident that those who run and work in the institutions that are supposed to support Ella and her family don &apos;t talk about relationships , because relationships are ex@@ press@@ ly designed out of a welfare model that was drawn up in Britain and exported around the world .
the contemporaries of William Beveridge , who was the architect of the first welfare state and the author of the Beveridge Report , had little faith in what they called the average sensual or emotional man .
and so the services that Beveridge designed and exported -- they can &apos;t address this kind of problem .
but here &apos;s the interesting thing , the really deep change : over time , the friendships that have formed have begun to replace the practical offer .
what did you see there and what did you do there ?
people were the real designers and , just overnight , Cairo was flooded with posters , sign@@ age , graffiti .
as I was studying my master &apos;s in Italy , I noticed myself missing Arabic .
what &apos;s more pure , innocent and fun as LEGO ?
in my view , such an extension of the Internet can only work if it &apos;s almost energy-@@ neutral .
but so far , we have been using special devices -- small photo detectors , to receive the information encoded in the data .
and the answer to that is yes , we can .
as I said to you , this is the first time I &apos;ve shown this in public .
how does this work ?
first , what does it say in the cap@@ tion under the picture on each website ?
and I caught the guys , and they turned out to be working for what was then the Soviet K@@ GB , and stealing information and selling it .
the second time , it &apos;s engineering .
if you take two Mobi@@ us loops and sew their common edge together , you get one of these , and I make them out of glass .
a musician who took time from his life to teach me , a sophomore , a freshman at S@@ UN@@ Y Buffalo .
he wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school .
no , no , no , no , no . I take attendance .
and that constant is the speed of sound .
then I remember what my English teacher in high school said .
if I had grown up in Taiwan , or any place outside of the West , would I have found models of happy , thriving LGBT people ?
one of the key figures in the movement is Bhu@@ mi@@ ka Sh@@ res@@ tha .

Rebecca O@@ nie : but what if underneath all the noise , we &apos;re not divided ?
we ask about and argue about health care , but how do voters think about health ?
and she was .
or perhaps , the evolution of an intelligence capable of creating sophisticated technology is far rarer than we &apos;ve assumed .
all of this will help us understand whether the universe is teeming with life or , whether indeed , it &apos;s just us .
and some physicists think you can only un-@@ baff@@ le it if you imagine that huge numbers of parallel universes are being spawned every moment , and many of these universes would actually be very like the world we &apos;re in , would include multiple copies of you .
my father &apos;s actually a religious leader in the community .
30 times , the thickness reaches 6@@ .5 miles , which is about the average height that planes fly .

Ben@@ voli@@ o : &quot; I do but keep the peace ; put up thy sword , or manage it to part these men with me . &quot;
is there a way to know ?
I think there is a way in .
so these elephants , you can see , obviously , they are resting .
then there &apos;s something that I call sympathy , a little more removed : &quot; I &apos;m sorry to hear that your grandmother has just passed away .
but we see other animals and we say , &quot; Oh look , killer whales , wolves , elephants : that &apos;s not how they see it . &quot;
she wound up wandering outside the park and getting shot .
passing life from one generation to the next is the chain of being .
is there an easier way to get a date that requires less initial energy ?
but how do aspirin and ibuprofen know where the pain is ?
and scientists are discovering that the brain controls how we respond to pain signals .
f-@@ sub-@@ p is the fraction of stars that have planets .
compare that with the estimates made by Frank Drake , Carl Sagan , other scientists or your neighbors .
for while they have evolved to overcome a host of obstacles , the most recent has arisen so quickly and at such scale that the species find themselves overwhelmed .
all I saw was a white , pe@@ arly , shiny spot that blinded me , and I didn &apos;t understand what was going on .
he looks at the gun , straight down the barrel .

Cantor also showed that , for any infinite set , forming a new set made of all the sub@@ sets of the original set represents a bigger infinity than that original set .
with 47@@ 3,000 square meters , it is one of the largest buildings ever built in the world .
we collaborated with the local community and built , out of recycled materials of their own , this fantastical floating platform that gently moved in the ocean as we watched films from the British film archive , &#91; 190@@ 3 &#93; &quot; Alice in Wonder@@ land , &quot; for example .
there was no clear difference between atoms and molecules .
so -- again , this is five years ago -- so doing journalism and virtual reality together was considered a wor@@ se-@@ than-@@ half-@@ baked idea , and I had no funding .
so here &apos;s the real line . you can see how long it was , right ?
now , when you &apos;re in the middle of that scene and you hear those sounds , and you see the injured around you , it &apos;s an incredibly scary and real feeling .
and after the moment of transmission , it &apos;s gone forever .

it &apos;s the reason I still dive .
I accept the pressure and go with it .

( music ) I &apos;d like you to know that if one day you try to stop breathing , you &apos;ll realize that when you stop breathing , you stop thinking , too .
today , in the 21st century , we &apos;re under so much pressure .
this is our plight in the 21st century : our backs hurt , our necks hurt , everything hurts , because we &apos;re stressed and tense all the time .
each of those galaxies contains about 100 billion stars .
to answer that question , we don &apos;t look out there .
but Venus is not habitable , at least not at its surface .
ideally , those who challenge the establishment should be wise , confident , brave , physically strong , with a type of charisma that in@@ pi@@ res followers .

we call A &quot; the Silver Spo@@ on , &quot; the one who clearly had advantages and was destined for success .
well , the sun emits all colors of light , so light of all colors is hitting your pencil .
those workers leave the city , never to return .
and then also to include the failure .
this result , that light sometimes behaves like a particle and sometimes behaves like a wave , led to a revolutionary new physics theory called quantum mechanics .
this tension or suspense in both genres drives the story and keeps the plot progressing .
after I &apos;d worked out which of the many different lists of countries in the world to use for my project , I ended up going with the list of UN@@ -@@ recognized nations , to which I added Taiwan , which gave me a total of 19@@ 6 countries .
and pretty soon , it was strangers .
yes , the Panama Canal has a Twitter account .
but , within a week of me putting a call out on Twitter and Facebook for Portuguese speakers , I had more people than I could involve in the project , including Margaret J@@ ull Costa , a leader in her field , who has translated the work of Nobel Prize winner José Sar@@ ama@@ go .
my weakness had become the project &apos;s strength .
but it can also be really enlighten@@ ing .
( Laughter ) So , interaction is key , it is key to understanding how to work in our world with us , and so the interaction piece is very important .
for example , two people who are both into scary movies are probably a better match than one person who is and one who isn &apos;t .
basically , you &apos;re a neat freak .

a male coworker was annoyed that I had been out on &apos; vacation , &apos; so he intentionally opened the door on me while I was pumping breast milk and stood in the doorway with inmates in the hallway . &quot;
today in America , women make up 47 percent of the workforce , and in 40 percent of American households a woman is the sole or primary bread@@ winner .
but when you &apos;re really close -- imagine the sides of the doorway are here and here , but if you look up at this cathedral doorway and do your fingers like this , the sides of the doorway are going up , like railroad tracks in the sky .
and after this storm took off half of its tissue , it became infested with algae , the algae over@@ grew the tissue and that coral died .
and we found that corals , even without the biology involved , still prefer white and pink , the colors of a healthy reef .
we can choose to use the materials and colors and textures that might bias the system back toward those corals .
in fact , it &apos;s so rare , that last year it was listed as a threatened species on the endangered species list .
I &apos;ve been trying to help corals become parents for over 10 years now .
the big mystery is whether Euclid had any inkling of the existence of these different geometries when he wrote his postulate .
instead , the universe consisted of a swirling sea of subatomic matter .
but , there are things that , despite looking really hard , we still can &apos;t quite see .
since then , photography has found its way into all aspects of math and science .
sometimes cameras can help us see matter or movements that are too small for the naked eye .
if you look at how they are related on a family tree , the evolution of feathers doesn &apos;t seem quite so impossible .
it represents an amount of digital information , which is uncomfortable to store , transport , or analyze .
so , big data isn &apos;t new .
so I quickly designed a skirt on my computer , and I loaded the file on the printer .
from what we can see , they ought to fly apart , but they don &apos;t .
we &apos;ve long known that the heavens do not revolve around us and that we &apos;re residents of a fairly ordinary planet , orbiting a fairly ordinary star , in the spiral arm of a fairly ordinary galaxy .
it looks as if dark energy makes up about 68 % of the universe and dark matter about 27 % , leaving just 5 % for us and everything else we can actually see .
not bad for a day &apos;s work .
no problem !
do you find yourself thinking of other ways to put bioluminescence to good use ?
in computer science , an algorithm is a set of instructions for solving some problem , step-by-step .
pretty simple , right ?
and again , it &apos;s not a coincidence that I use China as the example , because China , in addition to being the biggest catcher of fish , is also the biggest farmer of fish .
they can heat their bodies 20 degrees above ambient temperature , they can swim at over 40 miles an hour .
they &apos;ve gotten it below two to one , although it &apos;s a little bit of a cheat because if you look at the way aquaculture feed is produced , they &apos;re measuring pellets -- pounds of pellets per pound of salmon .
this exists kind of on paper .

there are brittle stars growing on these corals .
those are things that look like tentacles coming out of corals .
to do that , we need to charter a research boat .
I &apos;ve never seen anything like this and it took us all a bit surprised .
but 4,000 years is not enough to get us back to our last glacial maximum .
so how this actually works is we would install this piece of composite material into these existing spots that are already in the plane .
in a sense , our piece of the universe was once at the center .
have you ever helped set a table and found yourself wondering where to place the forks ?
B , your bread plate , is on the left ; M , your meal , is in the middle , and W , your water , is on the right .
hydrogen has one proton , helium , two protons , lithium , three protons , and so on .
the primary component of the most common form of sand is silicon dioxide .
and , when she stops suddenly , velocity decreases rapidly back to zero miles per hour , her brain would crash into the other side of her skull , turning her brain into mush .
if you wake up one morning with 1,000 times the strength you had the night before , how will you handle delicate day-to-day tasks ?
even if you rip off the nearest door to provide a bigger area to catch her with , you still wouldn &apos;t be able to save her anyway .
remember , it &apos;s not the fall that kills her , but the sudden stop at the bottom .
let &apos;s say she &apos;s falling from a 32 story building , about 300 feet , and you are 6 feet tall , maybe 10 feet on your ti@@ pp@@ y-@@ toes , with your arms above your head holding a door , in hopes of distributing the pressure across a larger surface area , but all you &apos;re doing is essentially moving the ground up by 10 feet .
this process requires a lot of cushi@@ on space between the point she starts falling and the ground .
this changes what a meaningful relationship means , doesn &apos;t it ?
that &apos;s when she was a little baby .
and Newton &apos;s Third Law states that for every action , there is an equal and opposite reaction .
however , none of these options can make an object as large as a person appear invisible for all angles and distances while its moving .
so , when the comma asks if it can help , the subordinate is appalled at the idea of needing assistance .
of course he does ! hurry !
they allow the comma to go ahead of them .
let &apos;s start to answer this question with a math problem .
I also know how to take the area of a square .
mankind , according to P@@ ico , could crawl down the chain and behave like an animal or crawl up the chain and behave like a god , it &apos;s our choice .
these difficulties are more widespread and varied than commonly imagined .
in the Western music tradition , pitches are named after the first seven letters of the alphabet , A , B , C , D , E , F , and G .
let &apos;s add another instrument with its own pitch and rhythm .
they drifted apart slowly , little by little becoming more and more different .
in the 8@@ th century , Scandin@@ avian mar@@ au@@ ders started taking over much of England .
plur@@ als made a lot more sense now , except for a few hol@@ d-@@ outs like children and teeth that get used so much that it was hard to break the habit .
( Laughter ) JF : I &apos;m showing you the way .
( Laughter ) PM : and -- LT : wait , no , it &apos;s really important because this is another example of how women are overlooked , put aside , marginalized .
JF : I think -- we sure crossed our legs a lot .
LT : I think we all know what you mean .
I just see deeply into your soul .
they feel spiritual because it &apos;s a heart opening , right ?
and the answer is patriarchal culture , which says to boys and young men that to be needing of relationship , to be emotional with someone is gir@@ ly .
you try to get up and run away , but you realize that you are completely im@@ mobilized .
your breath becomes more shallow and rapid .
we want to team up with other inventors , creators , philanthropists , educators , biologists , to see better futures for our oceans .
and a Soviet delegate at the U.N. mock@@ ingly suggested that the U.S. should receive foreign aid for developing nations .
but standing at the North Pole is difficult to do for very long because it &apos;s in the middle of an ocean , covered by constantly shifting , frozen sea ice .
this device directs the pacemaker to malfunction , ultimately resulting in the foreign leader &apos;s death .
over the last century , these two ideas have utterly transformed our understanding of the universe .
so the computing power did not exist in the early &apos; 90s when design work began in earnest .
we &apos;ll need an action .
as the scene unfolds , your brain &apos;s hemispheres process a fl@@ urry of information : the waiter &apos;s fla@@ iling arms , his cry for help , the smell of pasta .
and there have been reactions of two different kinds : welcoming parties and border fences .
but I want to look at it a little bit from the short-term and the long-term perspective .
the long-term ones , in relation to Syrians , is that hope is less and less clear for people .
not only are they refugees , out of home , not only have they suffered what they have suffered , but they are living in very , very dramatic conditions .
all the borders in Ethiopia are open .
it is a statement made by the current front-@@ runner for the Republican nom@@ ination for US President , Donald Trump .
and I must say , I am convinced that the passport that appeared , I believe , was put by the person who has blown -- BG : -- himself up , yeah .
you know , one of the terrible things when one leaves an office is to try to become the backseat driver , always telling the new one what to do .
there &apos;s no shortage of answers .
or sanity ?
love is also a set of behaviors we associate with the feeling : holding hands , kissing , hugging , public displays of affection , dating , marriage , having kids , or just sex .
imagine two people are listening to music .
different kinds of light are all around you everyday but are invisible to the human eye , from the radio waves that carry your favorite songs , to the x-rays doctors use to see inside of you , to the microwaves that heat up your food .
to many , one of the coolest things about &quot; Game of Thrones &quot; is that the inhabitants of the Do@@ th@@ ra@@ ki Sea have their own real language .
that is , a real language has grammar .
soon other troops began performing in the same style , and Kabuki made history as Japan &apos;s first dramatic performance form ca@@ tering to the common people .
due to these influences , the once spontaneous , one-@@ act dance evolved into a structured , five-@@ act play often based on the tenets of Confucian philosophy .
its teeth resembled tongue stones , odd rocks seen inside other rocks in Mal@@ ta and the mountains near Florence .
every atom has a core , which is made up of at least one positively charged particle called a proton , and in most cases , some number of neutral particles called neutrons .
and I &apos;m the fourth director of the study .
similar to a domino effect , one person &apos;s yawn triggers a yawn in a person nearby that has observed the act .
we were crowdsourcing ideas from the people .
we were engaging them .
then came the consequences .
both groups wanted you to side with them ; you were either with them or against them .
it &apos;s as if we agreed that we are here to talk at each other instead of talking with each other .
don &apos;t let the ap@@ ron deceive you !
as this reaction occurs , it produces a range of flavor and aroma compounds , which also react with each other , forming even more complex tastes and smells .
then the bug will use its ser@@ rated man@@ di@@ bles to carve a little hole in your skin , allowing it to probe around with its prob@@ osc@@ is , searching for a blood vessel .
for example , the psychologist Daniel Opp@@ en@@ heimer , a few years ago , teamed up with high school teachers .
so what do you do ?
these cards are disruptive .
a particular type of scientist , called a cosmo@@ logist , spends her time thinking about that very question .
so , what is the universe made of ?
the universe contains all the things that we can see , like stars , gas , and planets .
we call the accelerating end state of the universe a de S@@ it@@ ter phase , named after the Dutch mathematician Wil@@ lem de S@@ it@@ ter .
the other 75 % of us don &apos;t notice .
but think of a lobster .
they make rules , maps , lineages , languages , cultures , universes , alternate universes within universes , and from those worlds sprout story , after story , after story .
some astronomers focus their time and energy on finding planets at these distances from their stars .
so I use computer models to calculate the kind of atmosphere a planet would need to have a suitable climate for water and life .
it &apos;s 1,200 light years away , and just 40 percent larger than Earth .
but why do we get motion sickness in the first place ?
one night , the unthinkable happens .
if we were dealing with higher orders of infinity , such as that of the real numbers , these structured strategies would no longer be possible as we have no way to systematically include every number .
Galileo seems to have been the first person to realize that there is no such thing as an absolute speed .
no ! some motions have only relative meaning , but some motions have absolute meaning , are absolutely real .
since we can be fooled by perceptions as basic as speed , maybe every perception deserves careful scrutiny .
here &apos;s how it works .
that kind of show .
it just didn &apos;t work that year , and of course that again made big news , including now a re@@ traction of a publication from the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
for instance , the center of mass of a flat , rectangular object of uniform density will be in the intersection of both diag@@ on@@ als , in equal distance from each corner .
there were no stars and no planets .
and it was dropping at such a rate that it would have left the drinking water in@@ takes for Las Vegas high and dry .
this figure here shows the stor@@ m@@ water park that they &apos;re building by hoo@@ king a series of stor@@ m@@ water collection systems , or storm sewers , and rou@@ ting that water into an abandoned gravel quarry .
we can recycle the water that makes it into the sewer , thereby increasing our water supply by 40 percent .
first , what is sp@@ ic@@ iness ?
and some studies show that spice developed mostly in warmer climates where microbes also happen to be more prevalent .
so , how can we find the culprit behind this calam@@ ity ?
if someone called you scum , you &apos;d probably be offended , but scientifically , they might not be far off .
plants use the energy from sunlight to transform carbon dioxide and water from the environment into glucose and oxygen .
but in real-life terrestrial ecosystems , less than 10 % of plant matter is eaten while it &apos;s still alive .
now , 52 may not seem like such a high number , but let &apos;s start with an even smaller one .
so the next time it &apos;s your turn to shuffle , take a moment to remember that you &apos;re holding something that may have never before existed and may never exist again .
simply choosing water over soda , ju@@ ices , and sports drinks is a great way to avoid hidden added sugar .

( Laughter ) Guys , you have to understand , this had been going for , like , weeks , albeit hi@@ ther@@ to the greatest weeks of my life , but I had to knock it on the head .
( Applause ) And that was so much fun , right , that it got me thinking : like , what would happen if I just spent as much time as could replying to as many sca@@ m emails as I could ?
ketchup , though , is part of a merry band of linear rule breakers called N@@ on-@@ Newtonian fluids .
I love being a police officer because it &apos;s always been a calling for me and never a job .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s pretty , ain &apos;t it ? it &apos;s cut up .
it &apos;s with@@ ering and it &apos;s dying because we &apos;ve invested so much in our protective arm .
you know who came ? it was the elders .
we began to deal with our youth and with those who we consider are on the wrong side of the fence .
although tsunamis are commonly known as tidal waves , they &apos;re actually unrelated to the tidal activity caused by the gravitational forces of the Sun and Moon .
this process attempts to ensure that the only difference between the groups is the one the researchers are attempting to study .
&quot; let me get this straight .
biologists call this bilateral symmetry .
it was shortly after I had relocated from the US to Nigeria .
I &apos;d quit my job in corporate America and decided to take this big leap of faith , a leap of faith that came out of a deep sense of conviction that there was a lot of work to do in Nigeria in the area of sustainable development .
see , I &apos;m a computer scientist by background and not someone in the creative arts .
so I literally took my dried weeds in hand , there were several more of them , and went knocking from door to door to find out who could teach me how to weave these water hyacinth stems into ropes .
and that was the beginning of partnerships .
and if you want to change a culture , change the stories . &quot;
another system of interconnected brain cells called the sali@@ ence network decides what to pay attention to .
during major events , such as the Arab Spring or the Ukra@@ inian protests , new@@ sca@@ sters and bloggers have posted updates and recordings from the midst of the chaos .
with no way to dispose of the pigment , the dyes inside them remain visible through the skin .
so a single tattoo may not truly last forever , but tattoos have been around longer than any existing culture .
these sculpting tools have evolved through their use , and each one has a different form which matches its function .
and so you can also bring in existing objects , and those will be captured on one side and transmitted to the other .
so we sort of set up a mini-@@ sweat@@ shop in the Media Lab and brought undergrads in and convinced them to do &quot; research &quot; -- ( Laughter ) and had late nights watching movies , eating pizza and screwing in thousands of screws .
those are just three optical illusions , images that seem to trick us .
you &apos;ll see the same effect with a grid printed on a plain old piece of paper .
you realized your brain had taken a short cut and missed something .
but systems on the scale of atoms behave according to the laws of quantum mechanics .
the same sort of thing happens to physical systems at quantum scales , like an electron orbiting in a hydrogen atom .
the technical term for this is that the states of the cats are entangled .
you might be thinking , &quot; This is just some theoretical mu@@ mbo jumbo .
what is creativity ?
but if you &apos;re feeling a little bit uncomfortable with this answer , that &apos;s OK .
but what I do have are a bunch of insights about our relationship with technology .
so my first insight is that , for some reason , we associate poetry with being human .
this is an essentially philosophical idea , and it &apos;s one that can &apos;t be answered with software alone , but I think requires a moment of species-@@ wide , existential reflection .
like anyone else performing such an awkward task for the first time , he did horribly .
they heard excer@@ pts from these pieces in either their original form , or in a version that had been digitally altered to include repetition .
the real origin is much deeper and more amazing .
by combining waves with different wavelengths , which means giving our quantum object some possibility of having different moment@@ a .
I believe that the secret to producing extremely drought-@@ tolerant crops , which should go some way to providing food security in the world , lies in resurrection plants , pictured here , in an extremely drough@@ ted state .
all of the crops that we eat today , wheat , rice and maize , are highly genetically modified from their ancestors , but we don &apos;t consider them GM because they &apos;re being produced by conventional breeding .
if you mean , am I going to put resurrection plant genes into crops , your answer is yes .
and in order to do that I have to explain a little bit about how genes work .
what antioxid@@ ants do is stop that damage .
but wisdom and emotional intelligence seem pretty high on the hierarchy of needs .
he calls his project &quot; paradise engineering . &quot;
but is there something sad about a world without sadness ?
indeed , democracy is rece@@ ding in our neck of the woods , here in Europe .
but it would be a mistake to dismiss the significance of ancient Athenian democracy on the basis of whom it excluded .
similarly , the economic sphere has been colon@@ izing and canni@@ bal@@ izing the political sphere to such an extent that it is undermining itself , causing economic crisis .
would you like to share that ?
because if it doesn &apos;t , the centrifu@@ gal forces that will be unleashed will be demon@@ ic , and they will destroy the European Union .
Christopher Columbus convinced the King of Spain to send him on a mission to find a better trade route to India , not by going East over land but sailing West around the globe .
a single electron isn &apos;t choosing to go left or right but left and right simultaneously .
so there &apos;s been a long and sor@@ did history of bringing color underwater , and it starts 88 years ago with Bill Lon@@ g@@ ley and Charles Martin , who were trying to take the first underwater color photograph .
so if you think about it , the ocean is 71 percent of the planet , and blue light can extend down to almost a 1,000 meters .
later , we found this ste@@ al@@ thy green fluorescent liz@@ ard@@ fish .
and we dropped down , and we noticed one important thing -- that as we get down to 1,000 meters , it drops off .
you don &apos;t want to just go and crush them with a big claw .
you &apos;re essentially looking at a portal into consciousness that was designed by marine creatures .

we are caught in that space between beginnings and endings , in the great , huge totality of the human experience .
not only did the continent lose tens of millions of its able-@@ bodied population , but because most of the slaves taken were men , the long-term demographic effect was even greater .

the classical story of Archimedes &apos; E@@ ure@@ ka ! and subsequent streak through the streets centers around a crown , or cor@@ ona in Latin .
more importantly , thanks to the presence of human aesthetic in the process , we &apos;ll theoretically generate melodies we would consider beautiful .
it makes a wonderful link between swimming , as you find it in e@@ els or fish , and quad@@ rup@@ ed locomotion , as you see in mammals , in cats and humans .
now , one thing which is very surprising and fascinating in fact is the fact that all this can be generated just by the spinal cord and the body .
so a simple geometri@@ cal system that kind of coordinates a bit the internal movement of the segments .
especially , it loses this descending modulation to initiate and modulate locomotion .
precision , on the other hand , is how consistently you can get that result using the same method .
this un@@ boiling method won &apos;t work with a whole egg in its shell since the solution has to spread throughout a cylin@@ dri@@ cal chamber .

that &apos;s because they share the defining characteristics of mamm@@ alia and are evolutionarily linked to the rest of the class .

now hand your unlocked phone to the person on your left .
although the bird &apos;s outward appearance may not strike you as especially odd , it uses this strange , intricate , cor@@ k-@@ screw shaped contraption to reproduce .
and yet , what &apos;s the point of having such decorative ne@@ ther regions ?
some of the smaller sloths did survive and migrated to the tre@@ et@@ ops .
bright boys , on the other hand , found the difficult material to be a challenge .
100 percent .
with the Italian Renaissance &apos;s renewed admiration for Ancient Greece and Rome , the more recent style began to seem crude and inferior in comparison .
what secrets do its pages contain ?
we have labor shortages , and yet we exclude people who fit our economic and demographic needs from coming to Europe .
the system isn &apos;t broken because the rules are wrong .
in the Za@@ at@@ ari refugee camp in Jordan , you can hear the shells across the border in Syria at nighttime .
but they don &apos;t have to . they can contribute .
rather than seeing refugees as inevitably dependent upon humanitarian assistance , we need to provide them with opportunities for human flourishing .
but why should those journeys be necessary in an era of the budget airline and modern consul@@ ar capabilities ?
well funded and well respected , the Cu@@ ries were on a roll .
without more guidance , where would you even begin ?
and that &apos;s from less than five months from a prototype in my lab to a major commercial product .
( Applause ) But actually , to me , what &apos;s almost more interesting than either of these two projects is how people actually found out about them .
but this idea didn &apos;t hold up when doctors and scientists examined patients who were missing a hemisphere or had their two hemispheres separated .
and just in case he did , I built a backup plan , by reading the &quot; Left Behind &quot; books that were all the rage at the time .
all I had to do was avoid taking the mark of the beast , fight off demons , plag@@ ues and the Anti@@ ch@@ rist himself .
( Laughter ) And this idea spread , growing into a nonprofit called M@@ B@@ As A@@ cross America , a movement that landed me here on this stage today .
I felt the weight of revelation that I could sit in one room on one night , where a few hundred people had half a trillion dollars , and another room , two days later , just 50 blocks up the road , where a man was going without a salary to get a child her only meal of the day .
Bhutan is carbon negative .
that &apos;s how it looked 10 years ago , and that &apos;s how it looked 20 years ago .
but we are not going to sit on our hands doing nothing .
but we weren &apos;t giving them any .
he was 18 years old , he was African American and he was a senior at a local public school .
two : what data are you collecting , and how are you training your prosecutors to make sure that it &apos;s working ?
are you better than average at grammar ?
now , one summer day in 2006 , she was at a dig site called the F@@ y@@ les Le@@ af B@@ ed , which is less than 10 degrees latitude away from the magnetic north pole .
LN : what she had , she discovered , was a ti@@ bia , a leg bone , and specifically , one that belonged to a clo@@ ven@@ -@@ ho@@ of@@ ed mammal , so something like a cow or a sheep .
for me , it &apos;s a story about us , about how we see the world and about how that changes .
what was going on ?
every operating system has something called the schedul@@ er that tells the CPU how long to work on each task before switching , and what to switch to .
even computers get overwhelmed sometimes .
for instance , let &apos;s say when you check your inbox , you scan all the messages , choosing which is the most important .
a key was pressed ?
meanwhile , B-@@ cells and hel@@ per T-@@ cells use the information gathered from the unique anti@@ gens to start producing special proteins called antibodies .
if you ask Americans , &quot; H@@ as poverty gotten worse or better around the world ? , &quot; 70 percent will say that hunger has gotten worse since the early 1970s .
most people are walking around saying , &quot; You know , my ideology is based on basic benevol@@ ence , I want to help people , but the other guys , they &apos;re evil and out to get me . &quot;
let &apos;s not minimize the differences . that would be really naïve .
we need each other , in other words , if we want to help people and get the next two billion people out of poverty .
she couldn &apos;t wait to get out of her parents &apos; house , to prove to them that she &apos;s an adult , and to prove to her new friends that she belongs .
but then came my 90-@@ page senior thesis , a paper you &apos;re supposed to spend a year on .
( Laughter ) And then -- ( Laughter ) But then those middle months actually went by , and I didn &apos;t really write words , and so we were here .
( Laughter ) &quot; All of that &apos;s going to take a while , so we &apos;re not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today .
you have to keep well-@@ slept , well-@@ fed and propag@@ ating into the next generation , which in tribal times might have worked OK .
whether you &apos;re sending an email to your wife or you &apos;re compos@@ ing a symphony or just consol@@ ing a friend , you &apos;re doing it in pretty much the same way .
thanks , Ray .
it &apos;s a long-term state hospital , where several years ago we started working with Hyper@@ score and patients with physical and mental disabilities .
so , you want to say a little bit about how you guys work ?
and this was actually the least interesting part of the work , you know , the design process . we needed an input ; we needed continuous tracking ; in the software , we look at the types of shapes he &apos;s making .
and you &apos;re also going to notice a visual on the screen .
AB : yeah .
we made progress in a lot of the areas like automated harvesting and efficient lighting .
sometimes shifting your perspective is more powerful than being smart .
and the longer it survives that pressure , the more excited we get that this could become a cheaper and more deploy@@ able form of wind energy for the world .
we &apos;re trying to make ballo@@ on-@@ powered Internet .
a network of balloons in the stratosphere that beam an internet connection down to rural and remote areas of the world .
put simply : I want to create a new reality , a reality where technology brings us infinitely closer to each other , a reality where people , not devices , are the center of everything .
now , as I put this HoloLens on , let me explain the setup a little bit .
as soon as I &apos;m done with this TED Talk , I &apos;m going to immediately call my lovely family in Seattle .
if you &apos;re a machine trying to sense our world , how would you actually break the problem down ?
today , a group of scientists on our mission are seeing Mars as never before -- an alien world made a little more familiar , because they &apos;re finally exploring it as humans should .
AK : the camera has a fish@@ -@@ eye lens on it .
but allu@@ ding to the country &apos;s continual attempts to build a pos@@ trac@@ ial society after being ravaged for decades by apartheid , I tweeted , # i@@ fa@@ fri@@ ca@@ was@@ ab@@ ar South Africa would be drinking all kinds of alcohol and begging them to get along in its stomach .
and then I waited .
it was Africans taking selfies on the beaches of Nigeria .
so if we share the problems , why aren &apos;t we doing a better job of sharing the successes ?
my dream is that young Africans stop allowing borders and circumstance to suffo@@ cate our innovation .
before now , if you wanted to hear from the youth in Africa , you waited for the 6@@ 5-year-old minister of youth -- ( Laughter ) to wake up in the morning , take his heartburn medication and then tell you the plans he has for your generation in 20 years time .
my mother is a cin@@ nam@@ on-@@ skin daughter of a native Brazilian , with a pinch of haz@@ el and honey , and a man &#91; who is &#93; a mix of coffee with milk , but with a lot of coffee .
it &apos;s a kind of game to question our codes .
as a photographer , I realize that I can be a channel for others to communicate .
my office is the most boring office you &apos;ll ever see .
I lived in Silicon Valley for seven years .
really -- I mean , there are very , very heated arguments .
there are people who care about the U@@ I .
so they &apos;re two completely different cases .
but there must be something else .
( Laughter ) We embrace you , we embrace you .
we earned more money , we engaged more volunteers and we earned more votes than any political campaign in history .
when you walk out of the O@@ val Office , the first time I was ever there , I noticed a quote the President had embroi@@ dered on the rug .
it &apos;s the moment where all the pieces come together , and suddenly the world comes to life as if it &apos;s an actual place that exists .
it can create unbelievable worlds , unbelievable movement , things that are jar@@ ring to the audience .
these give us color depth cues , but also tells which direction is up in shots where we don &apos;t see the water surface .
so we pushed the visibility of the water well past anything you would ever see in real life .
now we recognize WALL-E as having an eye .
just long enough for me to think , &quot; Oh no , this is doomed . &quot;
so , we first treated our animals with a do@@ x core , do@@ x only .
it &apos;s about understanding the power of engineering on the scale of molecules .
now , I want to tell you a story about that .
and so , for example , let &apos;s take Jupiter .
around the same time I was writing this paper , I met with a colleague of mine , Jason Wright , and he was also writing a paper on Kepler data .
so yes , the natural explanations were weak , and we were curious now .
and if you search Google Ima@@ ges , this is what you &apos;ll find .
and that &apos;s even if your sense of self has diminished over time , as happens with so many of us the farther removed we are from our professional identities .
this is the mark of real change , of true institutional shift , because if we can solve this problem for relaunchers , we can solve it for other career transi@@ tion@@ ers too .
well , she ended up blowing away all of their expectations , and the company not only made her a permanent offer at the beginning of 2012 , but they made it even more interesting and challenging , because they knew what Tracy could handle .
all of this completely ignores the fact that throughout this period , there &apos;s another supercomputer running in the world -- SETI @ home .
software has done this in a way that &apos;s been very visible , because it &apos;s measurable . but the thing to see is that this actually happens throughout the Web .
and again , here , you see Bar@@ bi@@ e@@ .com , but also , very quickly , Adi@@ os@@ bar@@ bi@@ e@@ .com , the body image for every size . a contested cultural object , which you won &apos;t find anywhere soon on Over@@ ture , which is the classic marke@@ t-based mechanism : whoever pays the most is highest on the list .
as we grow older , we explore less because we have more knowledge to exploit on .
so instead of staying with it , we create something new .
but still , we change much more often .
I think the mark of a great company is being open to be challenged , and the mark of a good corporate board is to construc@@ tively challenge .
and so , if we were to dump any of us on Mars right this minute , even given ample food , water , air and a suit , we are likely to experience very unpleasant health problems from the amount of ionizing radiation that bombar@@ ds the surface of planets like Mars that have little or nonexistent atmosphere .
even if we borrow just a fraction of its ability to tolerate radiation , it would be infinitely better than what we already have , which is just the melanin in our skin .
augmenting the human body with new abilities is no longer a question of how , but of when .
and a lot of those people are children .
( Applause ) We are so clearly at a tipping point , because the American public has come together by the millions like never before , based on that common ground , to say , &quot; En@@ ough . &quot;
and we &apos;re marching across the country -- we &apos;re not just waiting for Congress to act ; that would almost be the definition of insanity .
rare earth elements can often be found , but in many areas , it &apos;s not economically feasible to extract them due to low concentrations .
when we put vaccines into people , we are putting unnatural things into their body because we think the benefit outwe@@ ighs the risk .
( Laughter ) They sell glasses online .
and now ? my wife handles our investments .
originals drive creativity and change in the world .
I had a student named Ji@@ ha@@ e , who came to me and said , &quot; I have my most creative ideas when I &apos;m procrastinating . &quot;
she has people fill out surveys about how often they procrastin@@ ate .
he to@@ iled on and off for 16 years on the Mon@@ a Lisa .
Elon Musk told me recently , he didn &apos;t expect Tesla to succeed .
so if you put all this together , what you see is that originals are not that different from the rest of us .
spending so much more on building the foundations of global society rather than on the tools to destroy it can have profound consequences .
no , not yet .
our political and economic leaders are learning that connectivity is not charity , it &apos;s opportunity .
all of those regions where borders have historically been the most arbitrary and where generations of leaders have had hostile relations with each other .
but the real test is going to be Asia .
and I am telling you that they &apos;re going to do this soon .
and yes we should all be taking far better care of our own home planet .
now , as you can see , Mars isn &apos;t exactly Earth-like , but it &apos;s by far the most livable other place in our entire solar system .
it actually won &apos;t take long for the temperature on Mars to start rising , probably less than 20 years .
( Applause )
but despite all of this momentum , we face some huge challenges .
for us at Global Witness , this is a moment for change .
but what could I do ?
but on &quot; Everyone held their breath , &quot; he stood his ground .
maybe you don &apos;t believe it , but here is the fact .
and without engaging brain , I heard me utter , &quot; Not in my lifetime . &quot;
and pretty soon , we began to see changes happening in many areas , precipit@@ ated by thousands of people , including many of you here today , and I thank you .
and it wasn &apos;t just those who had participated directly .
I still have my life to live , still have many more pages to pass into .
blood .
hidden .
I learned to be ashamed of my body .
( Laughter ) Thank you .
it &apos;s not .
this is hard-@@ won information .
so find those three things : rocks of the right age , that are sedi@@ mentary rocks , in a desert , and get yourself on the ground , and you literally walk until you see a bone sticking out of the rock .
we dug and dug and dug , and there wasn &apos;t another bone around .
we would give credit to someone we know or that we live next to .
it helps us understand the cred@@ it@@ worthiness of people like Jenipher , a small-@@ business owner in Nairobi , Kenya .
I was trained as a composer , and about 15 years ago , I started making pieces that were designed to look at the intersection between sound and image , to use an image to unveil a musical structure or to use a sound to show you something interesting about something that &apos;s usually pic@@ torial .
and what it really shows you is the history of editing in Hollywood cinema .
we &apos;ve got a qu@@ ill on the desk .
and I have this at a pretty granular level , so I can tell you that the men in the eastern half of Long Island are way more interested in being span@@ ked than men in the western half of Long Island .
so that &apos;s maybe a more democratic portrait .
when you do it wrong , it &apos;s anesthe@@ tizing .
and reducing us to statistics is something that &apos;s done at our peril .
we live in one of the biggest prisons in the world .
sometimes we make food , too .
but I did .
but I remember these words : &quot; don &apos;t limit your challenge , but challenge your limit .
let &apos;s take a brief reminder of what those tools looked like .
and there are some truly terrible historical examples of money printing -- uncontrolled money printing -- leading to hyper@@ inflation .
but if we use those extra SD@@ Rs that were issued , it helps governments get back on track , to meet that promise of 100 billion dollars a year that was der@@ ail@@ ed by the financial crisis .
that program has since delivered a 70 percent reduction in deforestation in the past decade .
if you don &apos;t get this pacemaker , you will be dead .
so I was thinking how I could explain myself better about how big and enormous this code is .
thousands and thousands and thousands and millions of letters .
and they apparently make sense .
I am a very particular and peculiar ethnicity .
not my haircut in this case , but my beard cut .
one of the reasons NE@@ OW@@ IS@@ E is so valuable is that it sees the sky in the thermal infrared .
unlike earthquakes , hurricanes or volcanic erup@@ tions , an asteroid impact can be precisely predicted and prevented .
some of them had even received letters from the people who received their loved one &apos;s organs , saying thank you .
so , never feel guilty about using this tissue . &quot;
a few weeks ago , I met a colleague whose mom was diagnosed with incurable cancer , and she said , &quot; Ni@@ els , it &apos;s hard .
I &apos;m passionate to make the change and help ensure that patients , and not their disease , are in control of their lives .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened .
and it might not even work , because the genes that control behavior are complex .
and let &apos;s start simple -- let &apos;s start with one listener and one brain area : the auditory cortex that processes the sounds that come from the ear .
and similar to the listeners before the story starts , these metronom@@ es are going to click , but they &apos;re going to click out of phase .
this my son Jonathan at a very early age .
now this is important , because what they found working in rural communities , is that even when they have a mobile screening van that can go out into the community and perform exams and collect samples and send them to the central hospital for analysis , that days later , women get a call with an abnormal test result and they &apos;re asked to come in .
if you take a more exotic material like ca@@ d@@ mi@@ um sel@@ eni@@ de -- forms a big , black crystal -- if you make nano@@ crystals out of this material and you put it in a liquid , and you shine light on it , they glow .
( Laughter ) So as a physician , what &apos;s just as interesting to me is that it &apos;s not just the color of materials that changes at the nanoscale ; the way they travel in your body also changes .
or maybe we want make something that &apos;s more inexpensive and portable .
I have no idea if you &apos;re seeing this , but I &apos;m just going to look ahead and trust that you &apos;re there .
and then there &apos;s this other island where there &apos;s just one songwriter who sits and plays man@@ dol@@ in for the ocean .
she had a genius for it .
it &apos;s always funny what you think the future is going to be like versus what it turns out to be .
I know . I tried everything .
what &apos;s happened in the music world is there &apos;s a culture , or an ecosystem that &apos;s been created that , if you take some words from Apple , the cat@@ ch@@ phrase -- that we create , rip , mix and burn .
the first thing I &apos;d like you to do is a little thought experiment .
what about ripping ? what about copying , reusing ?
we &apos;re going to be providing content to them in a whole range of different languages .
OK , back to math .
we can share and rip , mix and burn , but in fact , that &apos;s all illegal .
it didn &apos;t take long until people started contributing materials , for example , on ling@@ erie , which is actually a pretty good module .
I do have to say , somebody -- I read recently that van Gogh wasn &apos;t really necessarily psychotic , that he might have had temporal lobe seizures , and that might have caused his spur@@ t of creativity , and I don &apos;t -- I suppose it does something in some part of your brain .
and it was a man , a Chinese man , and he was stacking these things , not with glue , not with anything .
today , I am going to show you how this tablet and this virtu@@ al-@@ reality headset that I &apos;m wearing are going to completely revolutionize science education .
this is the next generation of young , bright scientists .
it literally feels like I just stepped inside this virtual lab .
I say that for a very important reason .
and we tell them if they win the game , they are going to get a big prize .
the first key ingredient is theory of mind , or the mind-@@ reading ability .
so try to tell me which child is lying and which child is telling the truth .
K@@ ang Lee : and this is child number two .
so in the last five years , we have been trying to figure out a way to reveal these hidden emotions .
now , I &apos;ve built a lot of stuff out of garbage , and some of these things have even been kind of useful .
listen , my lab is not in the ear@@ -@@ manufacturing business .
because I want it .
bad laws , sets of horrible , nonsense laws .
I &apos;d been in Afghanistan for a couple of months with the Northern Alliance as they were fighting the Taliban .
about 20 percent of people , however , wind up with chronic , long-term PTSD .
we know that the people who are vulnerable to long-term PTSD are people who were abused as children , who suffered trauma as children , people who have low education levels , people who have psychiatric disorders in their family .
that was also the wealthiest group .
they were trusting each other with their lives .
no wonder they &apos;re scared .
I &apos;m an accounting professor , and I do fraud research .
and then Mary tried to go to some internal university administrators .
and one day , Kathe was doing her job , just like she always did , and she stumbled upon a pretty interesting case .
their hop@@ e@@ fulness really is what drives them to come forward .
whistle-blowers are humble .
and he was hired to interview people that had sexually transmitted diseases .
we &apos;re all connected to Peter , actually .
if so , fortunately , there are countless records to remind us that the world does change , sometimes for the better .
lawmakers in these countries apparently hope that the fear of getting arrested will deter people from selling sex .
it &apos;s hard to get a conventional job when you have a criminal record .
and brothe@@ l-@@ keeping , by the way , is defined as just two or more sex workers working together .
in New Zealand , people can work together for safety , and employers of sex workers are accountable to the state .
resist those who silence us , those who say that a prostitute is either too victi@@ mized , too damaged to know what &apos;s best for herself , or else too privileged and too removed from real hardship , not representative of the millions of voiceless victims .
no doubt many of you work for a living .
ultimately , most of us have mixed feelings .
Far@@ ra@@ r , Stra@@ us and Gir@@ oux was like my mega-@@ dream press .
they said , &quot; Don &apos;t listen to anyone who tries to get you to shut up or change your story . &quot;
as it reaches the monol@@ ith , you realize you &apos;ve achieved something humans have dreamt of for e@@ ons : alien contact .
he , like Einstein , was in search of what we call a unified theory .
that raised a question : warps and curves in what ?
so he imagined that the world had four dimensions of space , not three , and imagined that electromag@@ ne@@ tism was warps and curves in that fourth dimension . now here &apos;s the thing : when he wrote down the equations describing warps and curves in a universe with four space dimensions , not three , he found the old equations that Einstein had already derived in three dimensions -- those were for gravity -- but he found one more equation because of the one more dimension .
now , the second issue that I want to finish up with is : how might we test for these extra dimensions more directly ?
but here &apos;s how the experiment will go .
and this theory is quite spectacular , but it has an obvious problem which is that it &apos;s built on just a few and very specific examples .
the LES contracts , squeezing the stomach entrance and creating a high pressure zone that prevents digestive acids from see@@ ping out .
an occasional bout of heartburn isn &apos;t necessarily something to worry about .
over time , constant acid lea@@ kage from heartburn may form scar tissue which narrows the esopha@@ geal tube , making it harder to swallow food .
my mom was an artist , and growing up , we always had art supplies all over the house .
that means that almost every single black man either has high blood pressure or knows a black man who has it .
you face this way when &quot; Col@@ ors &quot; plays , out of respect for people who went before you .
and up there , a place for gar@@ go@@ y@@ les and broken clock towers that have stayed still and dead for maybe like 100 years , up there is me .
( beat ) And I g@@ ots Bat@@ mo@@ bil@@ es and bat@@ ar@@ an@@ gs and fri@@ ck@@ in &apos; bat caves , like , for real .
and the one good-for-@@ nothing left standing grips a hand@@ gun and aims it straight up , like he &apos;s holding Jesus hostage , like he &apos;s threatening maybe to blow a hole in the moon .
since so much of this path lies outside the limb itself , most of it remains behind after an amputation .
and further research into phantom limbs isn &apos;t just applicable to the people who experience them .
they &apos;re an important reminder that the realities we experience are , in fact , subjective .
but it &apos;s not like that everywhere .
I still remember young women being driven to my clinic by their moms -- adults , who had to be helped into my exam room by their mothers .
and that precision let us hit hard the cancer cells , while sp@@ aring and being more gentle on the normal cells .
everything changed .
and I remember very distinctly a couple of days after my arrival , I went up to a feeding clinic .
Eric Hirsh@@ berg : so I assume that Norman doesn &apos;t need much of an introduction , but TED &apos;s audience is global , it &apos;s diverse , so I &apos;ve been tasked with starting with his bio , which could easily take up the entire 18 minutes .
tell us about him .
the truth is he would write an occasional letter , and I did pick up those little envelopes .
I submer@@ ge that in the word &quot; ras@@ cal . &quot;
it &apos;s hard for me to imagine , you know , changing somebody &apos;s life , but that &apos;s the way he put it .
photographing for anywhere from 15 to 30 hours and shooting over 1,500 images , I then choose the best moments of the day and night .
so every time my assistant and I shifted our weight , our horizon line shifted .
they embody a new metaphysical visual reality .
it is filled with perple@@ xity , frustration , a desperate fight for understanding .
what do you think , on such an occasion ?
and because it was a collective adventure , you need to share it , not just with your collaborators .
we also have some amazing objects from Japan , centered around craftsmanship , called &quot; Made in Japan . &quot;
and so now my mom -- every time I meet her , she asks me , &quot; Any more gold , any more silver in your project ? can you show me ? &quot;
so maybe we should consider , maybe it &apos;s much better to have less competition .
( Applause )
( Laughter ) Now , the question is : why does social justice comedy work ?
OK .
the point of the website is that it denoun@@ ces terrorism while recognizing that it &apos;s ridiculous that we have to constantly denounce terrorism .
hungry , extreme poverty : these often seem like gigantic , insurmountable problems , too big to solve .
children need food not only to survive but also to grow physically and mentally .
hunger and extreme poverty curb human potential in every possible way .
think about how extraordinary this is .
let me walk you through the three most basic factors in farming .
if you micro-@@ dose just a pinch of fertilizer to a plant that &apos;s taller than I am , you unlock enormous yield gain .
we first need more people to pursue careers in human development , especially if you live in a developing nation .
but so what ?
the language is pep@@ pered with barbar@@ isms .
most of us are concerned with the level of violence in the world .
take , for example , hypertension .
so , all these things are possible today , but we &apos;re still taking multiple pills .
and when I hit print , these will all fall through the device , I now pull out my personalized printed pol@@ yp@@ ill with the doses and medications meant for me .
but I &apos;m not just going to click &quot; See photo , &quot; what I &apos;m actually going to do is spend the next 20 minutes .
Nancy &apos;s on the left and she &apos;s working on a document , and John &apos;s on the right .
right ?
but that would kind of be like our goal with messaging before , where we &apos;re just trying to deliver a message .
imagine a professional social network that , instead of measuring its success in terms of connections created or messages sent , instead measured its success in terms of the job offers that people got that they were excited to get .
and we can do that .
they needed to be monitored and measured and awarded on the quality of teaching and not on all sorts of other things .
so we looked into why , if these things actually work , why don &apos;t they actually scale ?
when a supervisor comes to visit the classroom , he or she not only checks the construction of the toilet but also what is the quality of teaching .
that &apos;s my brother , Jeff .
a close-up in VR means you &apos;re actually close up to someone .
what &apos;s the coun@@ tdown look like ? I can &apos;t see .
audience : ... 15 , 14 , 13 , 12 , 11 , 10 , 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 ( Birds singing ) ( T@@ rain engine ) Audience : ( Sh@@ re@@ i@@ ks ) ( Video ) JR : let me tell you how I shot the cover of the New York Times Magazine , &quot; Wal@@ king New York . &quot;
you who gave us life took it away .
( Applause ) I believe that everyone on Earth needs to experience what you just experienced .
there &apos;s this obvious physical limitation .
and over the next five years , it progressed until I was classified as profoundly deaf .
without knowing it , from a very early age , I &apos;ve been a design thinker , fine-@@ tuning my skills .
I had the benefit of a spectrum this wide .
so , way back in the early times of the universe , we believe it was very simple and understandable .
just up the road .
and I &apos;d say that it deserves , in the spirit of Wade Davis &apos; talk , to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories of the peoples of the high Andes and the frozen north .
extro@@ version and agre@@ e@@ ab@@ leness are both conducive to working well with people .
so here are the consequences that are really quite intriguing : we &apos;re not always what seem to be , and that takes me to my next point .
extroverts prefer black-and-white , concrete , simple language .
but today , I &apos;m going to pick three I find interesting and share what actually it reminds me about launching new products and services .
they &apos;re absolutely everywhere .
we &apos;re effectively co-@@ designing their product .
secondly , often the best way to learn what people really want is to launch your service .
that following summer , I was in the back of a Land Rover with a few classmates , bumping over the mountain@@ ous hillside of Rwanda .
( Applause ) And Bryan had a bold architectural vision .
let &apos;s talk for a moment about what a model for processing visual information would need to do .
and we all know that if you have one equation , you can solve one variable by knowing the other two things .
so you can see it &apos;s not perfect .
there &apos;s still quite a lot of work to do on how we optimize that optimization process .
( Laughter ) In closing , I think that per Michelangelo , I think he was right ; perception and creativity are very intimately connected .
and the more I thought about it , the more I started questioning the question .
it &apos;s a powerful feeling that , according to another study , is a strong predictor of individual happiness .
and beyond individual symbols , there are whole national traditions that could not have existed without globalization .
no spaghetti , no pasta -- that really started in S@@ ici@@ ly in the eighth century , when it was under Arab@@ ian rule .
but the ones that emit gamma rays are even more extreme .
listening to this very gamma-ray burst brought us to the notion that the use of sound as an ad@@ jun@@ c@@ tive visual display may also support sighted astronomers in the search for more information in the data .
from here , Wa@@ iting for Go@@ dot only gets stranger - but it &apos;s considered a play that changed the face of modern drama .
and he wasn &apos;t selective .
I was so determined to survive that I used my scarf to tie tour@@ ni@@ qu@@ ets around the tops of my legs , and I just shut everything and everyone out , to focus , to listen to myself , to be guided by instinct alone .
but my priority and my focus was always my work .
I said , &quot; You know what ? we have to solve this . &quot;
but Dreyfus was the only Jewish officer at that rank in the army , and unfortunately at this time , the French Army was highly anti-Semi@@ tic .
so this is why I call motivated reasoning , &quot; soldier mindset . &quot;
and , as researchers have demonstrated , if you support capital punishment and the study shows that it &apos;s not effective , then you &apos;re highly motivated to find all the reasons why the study was poorly designed .
and this is ubiquitous .
and he had also discovered that another officer in the army had handwriting that perfectly matched the memo , much closer than Dreyfus &apos;s handwriting .
this mindset is what I &apos;m personally passionate about .
and the key takeaway I want to leave you with about those traits is that they &apos;re primarily not about how smart you are or about how much you know .
instead , teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea . &quot;
James C@@ av@@ it@@ t : thanks , John .
it isn &apos;t a place .
won &apos;t you help to sing these songs of freedom ?
redemption songs .
I can slow it down , speed it up , make it deeper , add an echo .
one library that keeps track of characters in the children &apos;s book collection every year , found that in 2014 , only about 11 percent of the books had a character of color .
Thank you all .
and a natural carbon sink was also removed .
so I &apos;m sure everybody would like to have that material .
and this seems like a tall order , especially if you want a suc@@ cul@@ ent tomato .
all we have to do is to bring these elements together and let nature take over .
now , when a single leaf falls on this forest floor , it immediately starts deca@@ ying .
( Laughter ) I got one , by the way , and boy , was he great .
Per@@ cy Spencer was a physicist working on radar during World War II , when he noticed the magne@@ tr@@ on was melting his chocolate bar .
you have the surface barrier of the human skin , you have the very rapidly reacting innate immune system and then you have the highly targeted adaptive immune system .
I can see I &apos;m losing you , Bob , but stay with me , because here is the really killer feature .
and the question was : what do we have to do to make sure that our company lasts 100 years ?
and this Korean arti@@ san went on to found a temp@@ le-@@ building company .
much more interesting , however , is the question : why did Fu@@ ji@@ film -- same product , same pressures from digital technology , same time -- why was Fu@@ ji@@ film able to survive and flourish ?
in other words , we need to think more mode@@ stly and subtly about when and how we can shape , rather than control , unpredictable and complex situations .
so let &apos;s not just think about short-term performance .
what we believe is that the Internet , frankly , is a connection of people and ideas .
those of you who &apos;ve never looked at their website , you should look at it . it &apos;s really impressive . and you can see how the Internet penetration has changed over the years .
what we mean by that is , you know , frankly , the PC was invented in 1980 , roughly speaking more or less , and for 20-@@ odd years , it hasn &apos;t changed .
I was eager to go off to college , and go find girls , and study , and girls , and study , but then I finished college and I fell in love .
we don &apos;t know that .
the ocean@@ ographers , when they go and look at these hydrothermal vents , they &apos;re teeming with life , regardless of whether the water is acidic or alk@@ aline -- doesn &apos;t matter .
these moons are fabulous moons .
that &apos;s maybe what we want to do as adults , but what kids want to do is hun@@ ker down in one spot and just tinker with it , just work with it , just pick it up , build a house , build a fort , do something like that .
additionally , these sort of E@@ den@@ ic places are often distant from where people live .
he said he was motivated by -- and I quote -- &quot; The scale of the injustice that the documents would reveal . &quot;
now , the Y@@ ap don &apos;t actually move these R@@ ai stones around or exchange them the way we do with our coins , because R@@ ai stones can get to be pretty massive .
now when this works , it &apos;s because there are large institutions under@@ writing every 1 or 0 that changes on a computer .
there &apos;s a lot of friction in the system .
my account gets frozen , and I can &apos;t get paid .
in a programmable world , we remove humans and institutions from the loop .
I can &apos;t say that I would recommend it , because right now , the puzzle is so hard and the network is so powerful , that if I tried to mine Bitcoin on my laptop , I probably wouldn &apos;t see any for about two million years .
crypto@@ currencies are the first step to a world with a global programmable money .
in the coming years , I became a medical student .
we lost the fear of creating something new .
so my initial idea was to create an an@@ am@@ or@@ phic piece , a piece that you can only see from one vantage point .
the building number 3 was the house of Uncle B@@ ak@@ he@@ et and A@@ un@@ ty F@@ are@@ eda .
and the reason is , the brain is incredibly , incredibly complicated .
you can &apos;t look at these tiny connections .
and this is where we &apos;re really lucky .
can we actually pinpoint the molecular changes in a tumor so that we can actually go after it in a smart way and deliver drugs that might wipe out exactly the cells that we want to ?
and that has a real impact on our colleagues , on our companies and our collective capacity to innovate .
and many others .
and they grow up creating equal opportunities for others .
I pulled off its bag .
I went up to ce@@ dar , and I ran the Geiger counter over its leaves , and as I suspected , silence .
you see , most of our forests now are managed using a one-size-fits-all approach , but good forest stewardship requires knowledge of local conditions .
it is comparable to pig manure ; we &apos;re omni@@ vores , they &apos;re omni@@ vores .
and I want to get you comfortable with this idea , so imagine the things I &apos;m going to show you , these technologies , and this attitude that says , &quot; We &apos;re going to reuse this .
that was Rec@@ ode &apos;s -- my organization &apos;s -- first co@@ de-@@ change campaign .
this was the first permit of its kind in Oregon .
either you lift people up by respecting them , making them feel valued , appreciated and heard , or you hold people down by making them feel small , insulted , dis@@ regarded or excluded .
so we launched a study , and what we found was eye-opening .
if you &apos;re civil , you &apos;re more likely to be seen as a leader .
otherwise , we create a new reality which is not the type we want for a rising Africa .
we are not creating the types of skills needed for the future .
first and foremost is infrastructure .
we &apos;re all going to live 10 years longer .
our physical peak may be our 20s , our financial and salary peak may be age 50 , but our emotional peak is in midlife and beyond , because we have developed pattern recognition about ourselves and others .
not the elder of the past , who actually was regarded with reverence .
I gather it scares you , too .
I did notice at the Lan@@ caster , Pennsylvania Wal-Mart , that far too many people in their 20s and 30s looked a decade or two from death , with pat@@ chy , flar@@ ed@@ -up skin and thinning , str@@ in@@ gy hair and brow@@ ning , ground-@@ down teeth and a los@@ tness in their eyes .
I did notice the news about those parts of London becoming ghost quarters , where the global super-@@ rich turn fish@@ y money into empty apartments and price lifelong residents of a city , young couples starting out , out of their own home .
I read , didn &apos;t understand .
I will not conce@@ de for a moment that old privileges should not d@@ win@@ dle .
I have a weakness for treating people &apos;s economic interests as their only interest , ignoring things like belonging and pride and the desire to send a message to those who ignore you .
this is a very complex challenge , and I believe developing countries could take the lead in this transition .
so if we want to get rid of o@@ il@@ -based transportation , we can , because we have options now that we didn &apos;t have before .
bingo !
they will be operating on a multi-@@ product , made-@@ to-@@ order basis .
that it was something happening far away .
the new manufacturing revolution will accelerate the transition of those emerging economies towards a model driven by domestic consumption .
this means more wealth distributed to all of us and a better future for our children .
but what we know is , out of the top 50 countries on the planet with organized health care systems , we rank 3@@ 7th .
number three : per capita expend@@ itures .
it is for everyone .
not just in that hospital room or on the couch at home , but everywhere we go and everything we see .
we &apos;re going to be expanding this platform to the world , but already I &apos;ve gotten thousands of emails from people all across the world -- professors , educators , students , and other archaeologists -- who are so excited to help participate .
and Facebook , YouTube and Twitter are among the many companies who report having taken down hundreds of thousands of pieces of content and de@@ activating accounts that are connected to the extremist &apos;s speech .
we &apos;ve got to make sure that these people not only survive , but are able to continue to thrive .
I built up my comfort over time and slowly took on bigger and more challenging walls .
there were no easy answers , but El Cap meant enough to me that I would put in the work and find out .
we started to train harder , and the results were great ; they asked for more .
he suggested we go to church .
I didn &apos;t want to make him feel bad , because he truly believed this could happen .
he said , &quot; Tell me what you see , tell me who &apos;s playing the drums . &quot;
they &apos;re a model national team , everyone in CE@@ NA@@ RD knows who they are , and after having won two World Champ@@ ionships and two Paralymp@@ ic medals , no one doubts they are high-performance athletes .
is that child my son ?
I can call anyone , anytime .
by the early 20th century , the perfect balance of science and art had finally been struck with the emergence of medical illustr@@ ators .
but why is it that medical illustration -- both past and present -- captures our imaginations ?
Danny Qu@@ ir@@ k is a young artist who paints his subjects in the process of self-@@ dissection .
Thank you .
but that &apos;s not their job .
it &apos;s made a huge chunk of its money .
so like any good nerd dad , I went to buy my daughter Gam@@ ora stuff , and when I got to the store , I learned a very interesting thing .
but wait a minute -- isn &apos;t the internet international ?
but this got me to thinking .
our privacy is being under@@ mined .
and it even handles reputation , because if she rates a room as a five-star room , that room is there , and it &apos;s rated , and it &apos;s immu@@ table .
they were unexpected pleasures .
if you can do that , it &apos;ll help other people see you that way , too .
we have a bias when it comes to people we &apos;re close to .
they &apos;ll glance at each other from a distance .
another is triang@@ ulation .
another is what I call noticing .
the dog or the baby is a social conduit to the person , and you can tell by how they respond whether they &apos;re open to talking more .
you might have that experience I talked about of feeling understood .
material scientists have figured out how to heal cracks up to twice that size by adding hidden glue into the concrete mix .
so how did that Canada become today &apos;s Canada ?
and these two influences soon combined to create the passionately open-minded Canada of today .
not long ago , I met with Pe@@ ña and asked how he managed it all .
the other problem was that Canada &apos;s long cold war between its French and its English communities had just become a hot one .
with just less than five minutes remaining , where should you place the 2 vacuum nozzles to suck up all the robo-ants ?
R@@ Wat@@ ts : well , you know what they say in Russia .
despite their extraordinary achievements , none of these women have made it into our narrative of the First In@@ tifada .
if we do not lift up the women who played critical roles in these struggles , we fail to offer up role models to future generations .
a lot of them were having trouble with math at first , because they had all of these gaps accumulated in their learning .
I thought that was a pretty big deal .
that will continue for about two or three weeks , and then we get a test .
( Laughter ) Sa@@ me thing .
it means that you should just keep working on it .
we have the tools to do it .
I first proposed , in the early 1990s , that mycelium is Earth &apos;s natural Internet .
makes the rocks crumble , and the first step in the generation of soil .
but the insects aren &apos;t stupid , and they would avoid the spores when they came close , and so I morphed the cultures into a non-@@ spor@@ ulating form .
we should work like our mothers .
whatever you call it , more and more men are craving these whole , if not har@@ ried , lives .
but when you look at the data , German emissions have actually been going up since 2009 , and there &apos;s really not anybody who &apos;s going to tell you that they &apos;re going to meet their climate commitments in 2020 .
there &apos;s a reactor that &apos;s coming online now , they &apos;re starting to sell it .
once my colleagues and I at the National Institute of Mental Health conducted some of the first ever brain imaging research of psychopathic adolescents , and our findings , and the findings of other researchers now , have shown that people who are psychopathic pretty reliably exhibit three characteristics .
but all of these changes also yield a strange and paradoxical result , which is that even as the world is becoming a better and more humane place , which it is , there &apos;s a very common perception that it &apos;s becoming worse and more cruel , which it &apos;s not .
Thank you .
for the past several years , I &apos;ve been studying the corporate and entrepreneurial leaders who question the conventional wisdom about how to run a company .
that &apos;s why Dan@@ e &apos;s not alone .
now , pay transparency takes a lot of forms .
Bran@@ don &apos;s post created a global sensation that touched the lives of millions .
my vote won &apos;t count .
the game of public policy today is rigged in many ways .
a few decades later , the suffra@@ get@@ tes brought a spirit of theatri@@ c@@ ality to their fight , marching together in white dresses as they claimed the franchise .
I have passion in my heart .
think about the way that that affects a child &apos;s mind .
I remember when I went to go buy a car for the very first time , I was offered a dealer &apos;s low , low interest rate of 2@@ 1.@@ 9 percent , and I was ready to sign on the dotted line .
why do we dance ?
so the task is to try to figure out how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission , thereby allowing the organism only to be transmitted by person-to-@@ person contact , or person@@ -@@ food-@@ person contact -- both of which would really require that people be mobile and fairly healthy for transmission .
they had dam@@ med up the Tennessee River .
so , this is the kind of thing I &apos;m talking about .
I &apos;m going to say almost not at all .
we can give you various people -- all the dating sites can -- but the only real algorithm is your own human brain .
for millions of years , our ancestors lived in little hunting and gathering groups .
the double-@@ income family was the rule .
as you know , there &apos;s another speaker here with us that works in your same field .
who dread the uncertainty and self-doubt that comes with this mass@@ a of choice , creating a case of &quot; FO@@ MO &quot; and then leading us -- FO@@ MO , fear of missed opportunity , or fear of missing out -- it &apos;s like , &quot; How do I know I have found &apos; the one &apos; -- the right one ? &quot;
it &apos;s a map in which we stretched places , so that those areas which contain many people are drawn larger , and those areas , like the Sahara and the Himalayas , in which there are few people , have been shrunk away .
and you can see areas in which there is a great deal of rainfall as well .
where the lights are shining up is where people live .
now , the lights no longer show you where people are , because people are everywhere .
now , this is often carica@@ tured , as I have here , as a fear that armies of malicious robots will attack us .
so what would apes like ourselves do in this circumstance ?
the repair is made , and now the genome is safe again .
it &apos;s going to take the cost of the average materials for an experiment from thousands of dollars to hundreds of dollars , and it cuts the time a lot , too .
your visual cortex takes up about 30 percent of your brain .
it was the end of achievement for me .
I will summarize very briefly .
I chose to step out of fear &apos;s tunnel into terrain uncharted and un@@ defined .
I cut my teeth on those .
each of us has a dream when we come here , a dream that usually has to be re@@ written and always has to be repurposed .
and soon after I had taken that formal step to becoming an American , the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , changed the immigration landscape for decades to come .
so in a somewhat spontaneous decision , I decided that I would publish my letter in the student paper , hoping to reach out to others in Oxford that might have had a similar experience and be feeling the same way .
but it &apos;s also made us increasingly reactive , from the smallest annoy@@ ances of , &quot; Oh , my train &apos;s been delayed , &quot; to the greatest injustices of war , genoci@@ des , terrorist attacks .
but the campaign never meant to shame anyone .
because we might be angry , upset and energized by injustice , but let &apos;s consider our responses .
for me , it was mostly outrage .
that &apos;s because the bladder is the thing that &apos;s clearing the sugar away from our body .
can anyone guess how many cancer cells are in any one of these tumors ?
and that &apos;s more or less it .
and so the doctor took them away , and lo and behold , the cancer is now completely gone .
so if you &apos;re not responding , we &apos;ll know to stop the treatment right away , days into the treatment , not three months .
OK . it &apos;s done . thanks .
pink .
so , there &apos;s a rhythm to it .
so I &apos;d help her up and take both her hands and help her walk to the kitchen .
we called this time &quot; the beautiful awful . &quot;
so after the funeral , it was time for me to go back to my studio .
because of Ker@@ r &apos;s leadership style , U &apos;@@ R@@ en felt comfortable bringing the idea forward .
you are responsible for the lives of hundreds of men and women , and your base is under attack .
you choose not to tell anyone for fear of losing your job or being seen as weak .
you give the vision a name , Bloo@@ dy Face in Bun@@ ker , and call it B@@ FI@@ B for short .
I had my work cut out for me when I got my first job as an art therapist at the nation &apos;s largest military medical center , Walter Reed .
now , that is a massive trust leap that hasn &apos;t happened yet .
they were super excited .
and since this is machine learning , not traditional coding , there is no variable there labeled &quot; higher risk of depression , &quot; &quot; higher risk of pregnancy , &quot; &quot; aggressive guy scale . &quot;
there &apos;s no right answer .
jihad may at times take the form of fighting , but only sometimes , under strict conditions , within rules and limits .
and I couldn &apos;t help wonder how much these young boys must have spoken to one another about their dreams for such a life .
but there are underlying problems .
but we have to go beyond this and recognize the Sustainable Development Goals -- if we really want to seriously accomplish them -- must now occur within this safe operating space .
in fact , the only thing I can do with you is just to assure you that this is the first time it &apos;s done .
the second is a rapid shift towards sustainable food systems , investing one percent per year in sustainable inten@@ sification and really moving towards implementing and investing in solutions that we already have available today .
and one of the things it had was a tilt sensor , so it knew what direction it was facing .
we &apos;re already seeing some great use cases , for example , robots working with autistic children to engage them in ways that we haven &apos;t seen previously , or robots working with teachers to engage kids in learning with new results .
and imagine yourself sitting in the middle of a large , open field with the sun setting on your right .
( music ends ) Now , when I tell people I &apos;m an astrophysicist , they &apos;re usually pretty impressed .
but now we know if you speed that motion up even more , you &apos;ll actually produce musical pitches , and in this case alone , those pitches will work together , making harmon@@ ious , even human-like harmony .
I &apos;m not creating the pitches or rhythms , I &apos;m just bringing them into the human hearing range .
so again , what does it mean to be normal , and what does it mean to be sick , when sickness exists on the extreme end of a spectrum of normal ?
and that brings up another thing that makes social disconnection so dangerous .
young people as well .
and for the Prov@@ incial Council , we had even more candidates .
and it &apos;s gone a long way . we published 10,000 copies .
the silent majority does not need to be silent .
we can &apos;t wait billions of years to evolve our transportation system .
they &apos;re found everywhere on the planet except for the Arctic and the southern tip of South America .
it &apos;s been added later in post@@ production in a studio .
ac@@ ous@@ matic sounds -- well , the term &quot; ac@@ ous@@ matic &quot; comes from Pythagoras in ancient Greece , who used to teach behind a veil or curtain for years , not revealing himself to his disci@@ ples .
when it came to doing our first performance , I was so excited about wearing a pretty pink tu@@ tu .
( Applause ) And I &apos;m not alone .
there are fat@@ shi@@ oni@@ stas who reclaim their bodies and their beauty by wearing fat@@ kin@@ is and crop tops , exposing the flesh that we &apos;re all taught to hide .
but to be clear , I &apos;m not saying that people shouldn &apos;t change their bodies if that &apos;s what they want to do .
but governments are not so happy .
apple has spent a lot of time and money to make sure that its products are as secure as possible .
see , as I got older , I started to have this un@@ lawful feeling in my belly , like I was doing something that I wasn &apos;t supposed to be doing ; taking something that wasn &apos;t mine ; receiving a gift , but with someone else &apos;s name on it .
it was like I had some sort of survivor &apos;s remorse .
enter Brown v. the Board of Education of T@@ op@@ e@@ ka , Kansas in 1954 ; legal separation of the races is now illegal .
it was torture .
really ?
( Laughter ) I thought it was going to take 12 months , OK , maybe even 13 .
it &apos;s a coming of age for bringing data into the humanitarian world .
we need the data people from humanitarian organizations leading the way , and orchestr@@ ating just the right types of engagements with academics , with governments .
we need every spare second of their time . &quot;
how about a driverless world ?
president Obama has got the red carpet , he goes down Air Force One , and it feels pretty good , it feels pretty comfortable .
later on in the G20 , well , there &apos;s Obama .
Latin America , a lot of populism , made the economies not go so well .
so you &apos;re really going to see an extreme segregation going on between the winners and the losers across Africa .
you know , our neighbors are awesome : Canada , Mexico and two big bodies of water .
it &apos;s a much bigger problem in the Middle East than it is in Europe .
beauty can save the world when we embrace these principles and design for them .
they represent the word &quot; mathematics , &quot; and these symbols also represent that word and this we can listen to .
and I can actually recommend this book , it &apos;s a very nice book .
this is an octave , right ?
( Dru@@ m@@ beats and clan@@ king sounds ) ( Laughter ) Hey ! so .
we can look at the waves .
we can feel salt on our tongues .
and there was a popular protest in Iceland , so the sitting president thought they needed a trusted leader .
I found out on the afternoon of the first TV debate that I would participate along with the three men , and I found out on live TV that I came in at exactly 2.5 percent on the day of the first TV debate .
( Applause ) So , challenges .
let &apos;s start with media .
some would call that very woman@@ ly of me .
( cheers ) It is possibly my prou@@ dest title yet , and the reason is that women too often get pen@@ alized for using what I call their emotional capital , but I know from experience that we become so good when we do just that .
I think it &apos;s also very important , and you all know this , that on any journey you go on , it &apos;s the team you take along .
a terrorist attack .
the nasty stares , the palpable fear when boarding a plane , the random pat downs at airports that happen 99 percent of the time .
others have done the same .
( Laughter ) Un@@ happy with both options , I did the only thing that made sense to me .
perhaps one solution could be to introduce technology to students through creative projects .
we humans have been making war since before we were even fully human .
but disgust is different .
so I think you have to make an effort -- that &apos;s the main thing .
and before you do it , read D@@ ale Carnegie , &quot; How to W@@ in Friends and In@@ fluence People &quot; -- ( Laughter ) I &apos;m totally serious .
and it uses no fuel .
which brings me to my point of how blockchains lower uncertainty and how they therefore promise to transform our economic systems in radical ways .
how many of you actually understand how the internet works ?
but Belle was determined .
just like in society , you can &apos;t just listen to the one percent , the outliers , and ignore the 99 percent , the ordinary .
ninety percent of what they say may be wrong , in your view .
but this det@@ achment gives you years to spend on a study .
real-world experience is critical , also .
and only then in people who exercise as well .
instead of asking if time exists as a fundamental property , maybe it could exist as an emergent one .
and sometimes , their parents can no longer afford the fees .
and they want to have all of the skills that they &apos;ll need for the future .
this , in the end , is our responsibility .
after the fever broke , for three weeks I was so dizzy , I couldn &apos;t leave my house .
the symptoms were real , he said , but they had no biological cause .
I was training to be a social scientist .
we need to think in more nuanced ways about women &apos;s health .
there is -- ( Laughter ) Not always successfully .
well , it was hell .
so that &apos;s good , because that &apos;s a terrible -- 21@@ 33 .
( Laughter ) Here &apos;s quick history si@@ deb@@ ar for you : no woman ever burnt her bra in the &apos; 60s .
so -- ( Laughter ) I announced what we were going to do in a broadcast interview , and straightaway , the emails started coming .
they have been stom@@ ped to death .
they have been tas@@ ered to death .
then hear this , please .
healthy was another story .
my mom is not here , so I can say this now .
and this is not only an issue of social justice , as Ann Cooper said -- and , of course , she &apos;s completely right -- but it &apos;s also one of global survival .
how much livestock do you need to produce this ?
I &apos;ll never stop eating animals , I &apos;m sure , but I do think that for the benefit of everyone , the time has come to stop raising them industri@@ ally and stop eating them thought@@ lessly .
that punch card system inspired Victorian inventor Charles Babbage to create his analytical engine , the first true programmable computer ever designed .
and that seeking is why so many experiences that started with simple delight and amusement eventually led us to profound breakthroughs .
we have a narrow range , and our double bind is very large .
expertise gives us credibility .
when we tap into our passion , we give ourselves the courage , in our own eyes , to speak up , but we also get the permission from others to speak up .
I want to end with a few words from my late father that he spoke at my twin brother &apos;s wedding .
and of course these prosthetics have been getting more and more useful , more and more modern .
and that &apos;s the reason why it turns out it &apos;s actually unethical not to evolve the human body even though it can be scary , even though it can be challenging , but it &apos;s what &apos;s going to allow us to explore , live and get to places we can &apos;t even dream of today , but which our great-great-@@ great-@@ great@@ - grandchildren might someday .
( Applause )
they have a remarkable path to follow .
well good , because they &apos;re actually not going to solve the issues .
now , the CEO of Whole Foods , John Mac@@ key , and the board did not want to sell themselves to Amazon , because that would be the prime example of selling out .
and this is my issue with conscious investors .
M@@ ia Bir@@ d@@ song : why is Black Lives Matter important for the US right now and in the world ?
and what we &apos;re seeing in Haiti is that they were actually facing a number of challenges that even preceded this hurricane .
this is a 40 percent increase since the year 2000 .
but the problem with that is that it assumes that we are the standard for other people , and we &apos;re not .
TM : my mother &apos;s biggest concern when I transi@@ tioned was who was going to love me as I am .
TM : we are part of a community of folks -- Yeah , that &apos;s good right ?
KKM : y &apos;all ...
in the summer of 2001 , we connected with C@@ athy Wo@@ ol@@ ard , who was soon elected city council president .
this kind of transformation is exactly like sprawl in the last century , the movement where our investment in highways and automobiles fundamentally changed American life .
it was a radical transformation , but it was built by a cultural momentum .
( Laughter ) Of course , today it &apos;s important to understand and acknowledge that those benefits accru@@ ed to some groups of people and not to others .
what I have learned from our experience in Atlanta is not an anomaly .
this should be a call to action , because the answer can &apos;t be to not improve communities .
we can &apos;t call it a success without them .
Tina had already been kidnapped , strapped to a raft and sent over a waterfall .
and the teacher was freaking out .
you get the idea .
( Laughter ) B@@ orrow 100 dollars from a stranger .
I went to a Kri@@ spy K@@ re@@ me .
it was none of those .
I used to think I have to accomplish all these things -- have to be a great entrepreneur , or get a PhD to teach -- but no , I just asked , and I could teach .
and they embraced rejection .
I use my blog , I use my talk , I use the book I just published , and I &apos;m even building technology to help people overcome their fear of rejection .
these many things that enable our daily lives rely either directly or indirectly on satellites .
our country has two exploration programs .
most of our planet is in eternal darkness .
it was hot . it wasn &apos;t hot enough .
we did not know about this life system .
it contains more history than all of the museums on land combined .
Thank you very much .
( Laughter ) I told my sister we had probably been doing the same thing , car@@ ting around made-@@ up stories in our heads that kept us separate .
open to what &apos;s scary and painful .
the past and the present merged .
we can do this for the soul of the world .
I drew an apple tree instead .
DIY .
it &apos;s what they do at that age .
in that case , bear in mind three things .
this is when our institutions and our leaders are stuck in a paradigm that is rote and per@@ func@@ tory , devoid of life , devoid of vision and devoid of soul .
( Laughter ) And if you &apos;re lucky enough to make it 16 or 17 years , if you &apos;re like most people , you probably wake up in the morning realizing that you forgot to make a reservation at your favorite restaurant and you forgot so much as a card , and then you just hope and pray that your partner also forgot .
and I would tell you that every one of my patients is an outlier , is an exception .
in 1966 , P@@ ey@@ ton R@@ ous got the Nobel Prize for realizing that chickens had a trans@@ missible form of sarcoma .
sometimes these conversations turn on a single word : &quot; terminal . &quot;
the first one is : our own intelligence has a very poor understanding of what intelligence is .
human relationships are not efficient .
the best medical diagnos@@ tician is not a doctor , it &apos;s not an AI , it &apos;s the team .
so , my journey began in the Bronx , New York , in a one-@@ bedroom apartment , with my two sisters and immigrant mother .
( Laughter ) Since that is not going to happen , I can acknowledge this is not a matter of lacking time ; it &apos;s that I don &apos;t want to do it .
and you can do this for your personal life , too .
I know this is going to be more complicated for some people than others .
they found that people claiming 7@@ 5-@@ pl@@ us@@ -hour work weeks were off by about 25 hours .
they mostly just kind of hide in that back corner , behind a cup .
yet the mice that had gotten that one injection of Cal@@ yp@@ sol , here on your right , they were exploring , they were social .
but actually , beyond functional fix@@ edness and mental set , there &apos;s a real other challenge to repurposing drugs , which is policy .
that &apos;s when Russian radar technicians saw what they thought was a US nuclear missile stre@@ aking towards Russian air@@ space .
but before that cooperation could be realized , Kennedy was assassinated , and that part of the vision was def@@ er@@ red .
these are fundamental to creativity , things like a platform for international collaboration ; a date certain , which is a forcing mechanism ; and a positive vision that inspires action .
so what is it ?
it just came on the scene three years ago .
so again , today it &apos;s Halloween and when we talk about genetic modification , there &apos;s one Hallowe@@ en-@@ associated character that is talked about or invoked more than anything else , and that is Frankenstein .
so if we kind of circle back now to 2030 again , that imagined story , and depending on the decisions we make , again , today -- literally we don &apos;t have a lot of time -- in the next few months , the next year or so , because this technology is spreading like wildfire .
but is it the most effective and productive way to live your life ?
raise your hands .
well , most people are mat@@ chers .
so when government -- one of its most vital entities -- is weak or unhealthy , everyone and everything suffers .
sometimes you might put a Band-Aid in place to try and temporarily stop the pain .
and when people feel stuck and helpless , they stop seeing their role in a bigger system .
and then new particles might show up in our data as bumps -- slight deviations from what you expect , little clusters of data points that make a smooth line not so smooth .
it &apos;s crazy .
imagine you are a space explorer arriving at a distant planet , searching for aliens .
that &apos;s the stage we &apos;re at now .
but what if ?
yes , ATMs could do certain ca@@ sh-@@ handling tasks faster and better than tellers , but that didn &apos;t make tellers superfluous .
in the words of economist Thor@@ stein Ve@@ bl@@ en , invention is the mother of necessity .
it &apos;s decided by us and by our institutions .
but I hope I would have had the wisdom to say , &quot; Wow , a 95 percent reduction in farm employment with no shortage of food .
and as that happens , the heating that we find from the Sun is going to become very intense .
our hydrogen , from water that is broken down , is going to escape into space more rapidly , and we &apos;re going to be left with this dry , red@@ dish planet .
the reasonable first question that everybody asks once they &apos;ve been harassed is &quot; What do I do now ? &quot;
because as soon as your share your story with friends or family or colleagues or therapists , you have the potential to distort or change your memory of the event .
first of all , what happened ?
my sister is a special ed teacher in Chicago .
her chances of getting a nutritious meal , one with fruit and milk , one lower in sugar and salt , dramatically increase .
there was another object , this sort of towering piece of furniture with creatures and gar@@ go@@ y@@ les and nu@@ dity -- pretty scary stuff , when you &apos;re a little kid .
so , it goes from a circle , to a round , to a square , to a figure eight .
and the new experience I was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from a warm , sort of glowing kind of mood light , all the way to a bright work light .
so , in a way , the different structure is that we &apos;re partners , it &apos;s a partnership . we can continue to work and dedicate ourselves to this project , and then we also share in the rewards .
so , now you get these pictures -- you get up in the morning , and you see the kids in Nigeria and you see them in Uruguay with their computers , and in Mongolia .
but if you look around -- and there &apos;s examples everywhere -- Mother Nature builds everything this way .
and nature &apos;s not crude like us , just hacking away .
we &apos;ve developed chemistry that goes into the pile of dust , into the pile of nanoparticles , and pulls out exactly the ones we need .
and this -- this is the main way we talk about starting a new relationship .
( Laughter ) I fell in love for the first time when I was 20 , and it was a pretty turbulent relationship right from the start .
so when I was seven years old , he gathered all my toys , all my dolls , and he threw them all away .
maybe there are more of my people out there .
even in the fre@@ est societies in the world , we &apos;re not free .
and when she tried to go to her family for help , they said , &quot; Well , you got to go back and be a better wife . &quot;
and what I also learned is that extremist groups , terrorist groups are taking advantage of these feelings of our young people and chan@@ neling that -- cyn@@ ically -- chan@@ neling that toward violence .
why are these groups doing this for our young people and not us ?
and several of these young guys ended up finding caring and compassionate father figures within these extremist groups .
can you see that the swee@@ test revenge is for you to live a happy , full and free life ?
meet our Nobel Prize winners .
have you heard of the Linux and Uni@@ x operating systems ?
they came from Mul@@ tics .
so I decided to build a prototype .
the computer had to automatically make up the name and put it inside .
save wasn &apos;t working , so every time it crashed , I had to type in all of the formulas again , over and over again .
most people didn &apos;t get it yet .
I learned this lesson when I was 14 years old .
&quot; if you can &apos;t handle the Internet , fuck off , whore . &quot;
it happens to me every single day on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook .
it was published , it went viral , it proves that every single day online misogyny is a phenomenon endured by us all , all over the world , and when it is intersec@@ tional , it is worse .
( Applause ) Our friends in law enforcement have much to do , because we &apos;ve seen that online violence is an extension of in-person violence .
in 2015 , 7@@ 2,@@ 8@@ 28 women used intimate partner violence services in this country .
A@@ J : and I love you .
but it &apos;s always there .
all life on Earth changes the air through gas exchange , and we &apos;re all doing it right now .
and it &apos;s kind of hard to picture .
then I come in as the artist and take that recipe and recreate it using the component gases .
we &apos;re certainly not going to be able to prosecute the offenders .
but to do this , a first mo@@ ver was required -- someone to change the thinking in the security industry overall .
you see it in many different ways .
what can we do to chip away at polarization in everyday life ?
and it really -- it &apos;s almost like doing visual pun@@ s all the time .
it &apos;s very egalitarian .
these insights came directly from the community members and the police officers themselves , and as designers , our role was just to connect the dots and suggest the first step .
governments don &apos;t know what to do .
but how about us ?
amazing .
in the case of this aerial drone chassis , all you would need to do is tell it something like , it has four propellers , you want it to be as lightweight as possible , and you need it to be aerody@@ nam@@ ically efficient .
what &apos;s basically happening is computers are going from being like Spock to being a lot more like Kir@@ k .
it was telling the humans what to do , telling the robots what to do and keeping track of thousands of individual components .
and then we did something crazy .
water is a universal human right .
I ended up staying for two and a half hours .
I always bring food because when we eat together , it is easier to find what we have in common and make peace together .
I can &apos;t tell you how many times I &apos;ve stood in front of the Pyrami@@ ds of G@@ iza , and they leave me speech@@ less .
( Laughter ) Kids these days .
and also , we &apos;ve been posting on walls and obsessing about cats -- ( Laughter ) for thousands of years .
discovering them will do nothing less than unlock the full potential of our existence .
we want to treat them like human patient data , and not reveal their locations .
you &apos;ll then be starting to look .
the average was about a 50-50 split , just over halfway .
and it turns out , I was a pretty terrible guess : five .
this wasn &apos;t what I was wearing the day of the detention , to be fair , but I have a picture of that as well .
I know it &apos;s very frightening -- try to remain calm .
when I look at myself in this photo , if I were to describe myself , I think I &apos;d say something like , &quot; 19-year-old Indian male , bright T-shirt , wearing glasses . &quot;
let me start by asking you all a question .
I &apos;m guessing most of you have paid your tickets as well .
that &apos;s illegal under federal law .
he couldn &apos;t afford his fines and his court fees from that case .
what I have in mind is our policy of bail .
we didn &apos;t start out thinking that we were going to need Mars watches .
we would drive down there , and the restaurant owners would go , &quot; Who are you people ?
so these rover missions are our first steps out into the solar system .
rarely do you consider the voices of a group of four-year-olds , barely tall enough to reach the podium at city council chambers .
it was supposed to be an ice-@@ skating r@@ ink .
my daughter and I even sk@@ ated on a new , child-@@ requested ice-@@ skating r@@ ink , last winter .
so I told myself it was pointless to address what had happened .
their skirt was too short , their smile was too wide , their breath smelled of alcohol .
but I didn &apos;t show up at Thor@@ dis &apos;s door .
as it turns out , he , too , had been imprisoned by silence .
second , we must want to improve at that particular skill .
and believe it or not , that is a taxi in Nigeria .
so , tell me , how many policemen do you think are on this taxi ? and now ? three .
we all went out and did a mission and we &apos;ve done three of them so far .
but if you &apos;ve got ma@@ ins as well , it will charge the batteries in there .
they measure just 30 to 150 nanometers in diameter .
I know my struggle doesn &apos;t make theirs any easier .
but perfectly walkable cities require transit , because if you don &apos;t have access to the whole city as a pedestrian , then you get a car , and if you get a car , the city begins to reshape itself around your needs , and the streets get wider and the parking lots get bigger and you no longer have a walkable city .
that parking makes the sidewalk safe , and we &apos;re adding a much more robust bicycle network .
you don &apos;t feel enclosed .
mayor Joe Riley , in his 10th term , Mayor of Charleston , South Carolina , taught us it only takes 25 feet of building to hide 250 feet of garage .
she looked at me really confused and un@@ engaged , but then said , &quot; H@@ alu@@ l . &quot;
( Laughter ) So instead of crimin@@ alizing sexting to try to prevent these privacy violations , instead we need to make consent central to how we think about the circulation of our private information .
they called her a slu@@ t and a whore and they made her life miserable .
audience : Aw !
Jennie is making head@@ way into what has been seen for decades as an almost intractable problem .
and during pregnancy , that buffer can be an incredible tool towards shifting the impact of racism for generations to come .
we need to live up to our own ideals , and we need to recognize when what we &apos;re doing could potentially harm society , where we lose track of journalism as a public service .
news is adult education .
when the war was over , I got permission -- unbelievably -- from my medical school to take some time off and follow some of the families that I had be@@ friended in the camp back to their village in Kosovo , and understand how they navigated life in this pos@@ tw@@ ar setting .
&quot; my sister , who is pregnant , is bleeding . what should I do ?
thousands of these new arri@@ vals have experienced incredible trauma .
OK ?
now , HAL was a fictional character , but nonetheless he speaks to our fears , our fears of being sub@@ ju@@ gated by some un@@ feeling , artificial intelligence who is indifferent to our humanity .
cultural evolution is a dangerous child for any species to let loose on its planet .
so , let &apos;s see some memes .
Oh , well , your earrings , I don &apos;t suppose you invented the idea of earrings .
it gives us a completely new view of human origins and what it means to be human , all conventional theories of cultural evolution , of the origin of humans , and what makes us so different from other species .
from the moment that our ancestors , perhaps two and a half million years ago or so , began imitating , there was a new copying process .
in 1961 , Frank Drake made his famous equation , but I think he concentrated on the wrong things .
has it been tried before ?
but now , we &apos;re hitting , as I &apos;ve just described , we &apos;re hitting the third replicator point .
that way , it wouldn &apos;t matter if the planet &apos;s climate was utterly de@@ stabilized , and it was no longer possible for humans to live here .
so , those are the two possibilities .
and I take inspiration from the things that don &apos;t look like us , but look like these .
you know that at the end of their lives , they &apos;re going to degrade to nothing .
a robot gu@@ mmy bear .
Thank you very much for your attention .
those in power dictate the pace of the work@@ day .
but now , in the name of urban renewal and progress , these communities are pushed out , in service of bringing them into the 21st century .
last year , the Great Fire@@ wall of China started blocking this network I created .
they may have very egalitarian views , in fact .
so most of the time , nobody &apos;s challenging our good person identity , and so we &apos;re not thinking too much about the ethical implications of our decisions , and our model shows that we &apos;re then spiraling towards less and less ethical behavior most of the time .
but you can &apos;t fold the square or alter it otherwise , and you only get one shot at using the laser cutter .
in our case , for example , Sar@@ mi@@ en@@ to , together with Andr@@ és B@@ ello , spear@@ headed the biggest spelling reform to take place in the Spanish language : the mid-@@ 19th century Chi@@ lean reform .
so I believe that we must reach an agreement , that acade@@ mies must reach an agreement , and pur@@ ge from our spelling rules all the habits we practice just for the sake of tradition , even if they are useless now .
I &apos;m talking about our relationship with energy , with electricity , gasoline , wind turbines , all of it .
okay , on to our relationship history , the movie mon@@ tage version .
that blender is connected to the outlet , the sub@@ station down the street , the transmission lines ; it &apos;s an uninterrupted chain all the way back to a power plant .
over the past century , we left that close , instinc@@ tual energy awareness behind , and we began to blindly trust our energy .
and to illustrate this , I &apos;m going to turn Cayla on now .
and to show the world how unrealistic it is to expect consumers to actually read the terms , we printed them , more than 900 pages , and sat down in our office and read them out loud ourselves , streaming the experiment live on our websites .
one : you love the screen@@ play , two : the filmed version of that screen@@ play will not be in theaters by the end of that calendar year , and three : you found out about the screen@@ play this year .
I was in my office , on Sun@@ set , and got a phone call from another writer &apos;s agent .
the call began very similarly to the call about &quot; Super@@ storm &quot; : &quot; I &apos;ve got Leo &apos;s next movie . &quot;
suffice it to say , I was dumb@@ founded .
and then I realized that this thing that I had created had a lot more value than just me finding good screen@@ plays to read over the holidays .
and even an upcoming movie about Michael Jackson &apos;s chimpanzee .
I had a good job at a well-@@ respected academic institution .
they called for quarant@@ ines .
right ?
so let &apos;s take a look now at the biggest countries in the world , the ones that will most affect whether or not we achieve the SDGs .
and you have basically two solutions to this imbalance : either de-@@ glob@@ alize the economy and turn it back into a national economy , or glob@@ alize the political system .
almost everywhere , you see retro@@ grade vision : &quot; let &apos;s make America great again , &quot; like it was great -- I don &apos;t know -- in the &apos; 50s , in the &apos; 80s , sometime , let &apos;s go back there .
so the US cannot solve it by itself , and very quickly , the pressure on the US to do the same will be immense because we are talking about high-risk , high-@@ gain technologies .
so unless you plan to build a big wall on the border of California -- ( Laughter ) the wall on the border with Mexico is going to be very ineffective .
and at first sight , you think : why ?
but I &apos;m not saying that it &apos;s not bad , I &apos;m just saying that it &apos;s not new .
if you go to the forest to look for mushrooms and you don &apos;t pay attention to what you hear , to what you smell , to what you taste , you &apos;re dead .
one piece at a time .
well , first we looked at words .
&#91; Titan of B@@ ox@@ ing and the 20th Century &#93; Oh , yes .
( Laughter ) Talk about having to be patient .
as I sat with families whose children were at the end of their lives , I was acutely aware of our surroundings .
take Crystal , for example .
together , all of us today can offer that same specialized care that Crystal received by recognizing that children &apos;s respite and hospice care is a critical component missing from our healthcare landscape .
why is that ?
what we can control is how we spend our days , the spaces we create , the meaning and joy that we make .
I &apos;m not interested at all in blo@@ b@@ ism or any of that superficial rubbish that you see coming out as design .
so I am a 21st-century translator of technology into products that we use everyday and relate beautifully and naturally with .
each bottle is different , meaning the water level will give you a different shape .
this is a detail of a chair that I &apos;ve designed in magnesium .
you wouldn &apos;t want to have a fear of heights coming down it .
sorry .
( Laughter ) It sounds like some quiz show or something , doesn &apos;t it ?
so I thought , well , maybe that is the thing which has transformed governance in the bottom billion .
and so , what the countries of the bottom billion need is very strong checks and balances .
a company flies in , does a deal with a minister .
if the British Treasury can be out by a factor of 10 , think what the ministry of finance in Sierra Leone is going to be like .
that &apos;s our modest role . we cannot change these societies , but we can help the people in these societies who are struggling and usually failing , because the odds are so stacked against them .
this is why I &apos;m on this stage , but it &apos;s alarming .
where the highs are heaven , but the lows , oh , they can be hell .
and that guy got to make the very difficult decision , but really the life-changing decision about whether to go get help .
let &apos;s all never lose that hope , because searching for what &apos;s out there helps us understand what &apos;s in here .
he brought me a Middle Eastern dessert from Jerusalem , where he lives , and I brought him kos@@ her chocolate and held a &quot; God hates Jews &quot; sign .
once I saw that we were not the ultimate arbit@@ ers of divine truth but flawed human beings , I couldn &apos;t pretend otherwise .
the good news is that it &apos;s simple , and the bad news is that it &apos;s hard .
but when we assume good or neutral intent , we give our minds a much stronger framework for dialogue .
this might seem obvious , but one side effect of having strong beliefs is that we sometimes assume that the value of our position is or should be obvious and self-evident , that we shouldn &apos;t have to defend our positions because they &apos;re so clearly right and good that if someone doesn &apos;t get it , it &apos;s their problem -- that it &apos;s not my job to educate them .
we are all a product of our upbringing , and our beliefs reflect our experiences .
she was asking me to be humble -- not to question but to trust God and my elders .
each one of us contributes to the communities and the cultures and the societies that we make up .
hours in , it began to rain .
now , the answer began to come when a friend of mine lam@@ ented to me that her young daughter was a big sc@@ are@@ dy-@@ cat , and so I began to notice , and yes , the daughter was anxious , but more than that , the parents were anxious .
they were encouraged to play on the fire pole despite any tre@@ pi@@ d@@ ations that they might have , and often the parents offered guidance on how to use it on their own .
now , I know some of you won &apos;t believe me when I tell you this , but I am not against fear .
I &apos;m just pro-@@ bravery .
let &apos;s paint it . let &apos;s draw it .
I myself , am a recent vegetarian , which means I spent the first 30 years or so of my life frantically inhaling animals -- as many as I could get my hands on .
it means accepting that we are doomed to decay and die , just like any other creature on earth .
young women have lots of reasons for participating .
but it wasn &apos;t always that boys didn &apos;t want to .
the most sou@@ ght-@@ after look , incidentally , in which the outer lab@@ ia appear fused like a clam shell , is called ...
and it &apos;s worth asking young people : who &apos;s really the more sexually experienced person ?
I want them to be safe from unwanted pregnancy , disease , cruelty , dehuman@@ ization , violence .
so it made them feel less alone .
and it was not long after that that I started to notice son@@ der being used ear@@ ne@@ stly in conversations online , and not long after I actually noticed it , I caught it next to me in an actual conversation in person .
( Laughter ) So , I said , &quot; No , no , really -- it &apos;s penguin shit . &quot;
and maybe , indirectly , get at some of the issues of what caused them to be the way they are .
now , it &apos;s kind of nuts to work on a new nuclear reactor .
so , this is my latest coo@@ ker , and if this looks more complicated than the nuclear reactor , that &apos;s because it is .
so even before we continue talking about their medical potential , I think everybody should know about phages and their role on earth : they hunt , infect and kill bacteria .
first of all , the obvious one : yes , something was killing the bacteria , and it was in that liquid .
so how do you make the rare common ?
there &apos;s the brain , and you can see the cran@@ ium surrounding the brain .
it has difficulty growing .
and then , and only then , bring the child into the operating room .
operate twice ; cut once .
this is not a real incision .
and we did it two hours ago .
and so we played , and about a minute later , the girl next to him , in a white shirt and a pink skirt , stood up , put her hands on her hips , and said , &quot; Yeah , why do you look so different ? &quot;
and so I &apos;m here to de@@ bunk a myth .
and so I have to be very careful .
so it either has few shops and fewer shoppers , or it &apos;s abandoned and crumbling into ruin .
O@@ wings Mills Mall opened in 1986 .
so the comments just kept pouring in on the videos , from all over the country , and then all over the world .
( Applause )
I just want to say a word here for S@@ avi@@ our Chi@@ shi@@ mba , who was one of the candidates in the recent Z@@ ambi@@ an presidential election .
we &apos;ve got Hillary Clinton .
they really don &apos;t fit the pattern .
that &apos;s the new politics .
the program is based on a tri@@ ed@@ -and-@@ true technology .
in other words , what &apos;s so powerful about our approach is that it could turn on people &apos;s existing desire to do good , in this case , to help to prevent a blackout .
in other words , there &apos;s lots of excuses .
every day , we text patients to remind them to take their medication , but if we stopped there , there &apos;d be lots of excuses .
if they don &apos;t log in , we text them again .
patients without access to our platform were three times more likely not to complete treatment .
so without further a@@ do , a huge welcome to Gre@@ t@@ chen and David .
( Laughter ) And having done that and gotten that so wrong , I decided to spend the ensuing year just out in Tru@@ mp@@ world , and I found a lot of economic dis@@ location .
he &apos;s part of a global movement .
( Laughter ) CA : and failing . my com@@ miser@@ ations .
so let &apos;s just say that there was some bias in the mainstream media .
my name &apos;s Ya@@ el Eisen@@ st@@ at .
CA : exactly .
DB : the half-@@ life of that is short .
GC : right -- I was just going to say , until Twitter happens again .
at the other hand , we have to have an economy that &apos;s free and open the way conservatives used to like .
and the blood and sweat and tears he put into this lid , and that I had never even considered .
for one thing , the probability of a Hillary Clinton win was communicated with decimal places .
see , a lot of data visualizations will over@@ state certainty , and it works -- these charts can numb our brains to criticism .
good people could be seduced across that line , and under good and some rare circumstances , bad kids could recover with help , with reform , with rehabilitation .
if you look at it and focus on the white , what you see is a world full of angels .
and what is the system that creates and maintains that situation ?
they said only one percent .
9@@ 12 American citizens committed suicide or were murdered by family and friends in Gu@@ yana jungle in 1978 , because they were blindly obe@@ dient to this guy , their pastor -- not their priest -- their pastor , R@@ ever@@ end Jim Jones .
here are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity .
do they kill , torture , mu@@ ti@@ late ? 13 .
un@@ critical conformity to group norms .
so you need a paradigm shift in all of these areas .
they &apos;re not prisoners nor guards , they &apos;re boys , and you are responsible . &quot;
advocate for respect of personal dignity , for justice and peace , which sadly our administration has not been doing .
and for moms who have to return for work , because countries like the United States do not provide paid parental leave , they can have to go back in as short as just a few days after giving birth .
( Applause )
I am interested in how genes are marked by a chemical mark during embry@@ o@@ genesis , during the time we &apos;re in the womb of our mothers , and decide which gene will be expressed in what tissue .
months pass by , something reminds you of what happened the first time , a pus@@ her pushes cocaine , and you become addicted and your life has changed .
and a fundamental difference between an epigenetic drug and any other drug is that with epigenetic drugs , we essentially remove the signs of experience , and once they &apos;re gone , they will not come back unless you have the same experience .
if you can get these electrons up to a higher energy , so about 1,000 times higher than this tube , the X-rays that those produce can actually deliver enough ionizing radiation to kill human cells .
( Applause )
astronauts just experience weight@@ lessness because the space station is constantly falling towards earth .
set against a backdrop of bright gas , the black hole &apos;s massive gravitational pull bends light into a ring .
in the years since then , scientists have provided a lot of evidence in support of it .
getting this first picture will come down to an international team of scientists , an Earth-@@ sized telescope and an algorithm that puts together the final picture .
no one will ever pay you what you &apos;re worth .
but they don &apos;t define our value , and they shouldn &apos;t limit our earning potential .
in this and in many other small ways , she was diminishing her company in the eyes of prospects and clients , and diminishing herself .
she really found a lot of strength and power in communicating her message .
and if you &apos;re sitting in the audience today and you &apos;re not being paid what you &apos;re worth , I &apos;d like to welcome you into this equation .
what is even a bigger story is that every seven minutes , a black person dies prematurely in the United States .
&quot; we measure self-esteem , &quot; I said .
so I &apos;ve been &quot; fu@@ turing , &quot; which is a term I made up -- ( Laughter ) about three seconds ago .
and I &apos;ve been seeing that time horizon get shorter and shorter and shorter , so much so that I met with a CEO two months ago and I said -- we started our initial conversation .
and look , I &apos;m not advocating that we go to this guy .
we can push through that .
now I &apos;m getting more comfortable in the fact that at some point in the inevitable future , I will die .
we all have children .
so my friend went away with his tail between his legs , and six months later , he returned again to his boss , and he said this time , &quot; Let &apos;s do something about human rights in Burma , &quot; as it was then called .

Okol@@ oma died in the notorious S@@ os@@ oli@@ so plane crash in Nigeria in December of 2005 .
( Laughter ) So I decided to call myself &quot; a happy feminist . &quot;
so in the literal way , men rule the world , and this made sense a thousand years ago because human beings lived then in a world in which physical strength was the most important attribute for survival .
( Laughter ) Now , the daughter doesn &apos;t particularly like to cook In@@ dom@@ ie noodles , but she &apos;s a girl , and so she has to .
two months ago , my kids and I huddled around a cell phone watching the live stream of the Game Awards , one of the video game industry &apos;s biggest nights .
more than any award ever could .
and they feel that discovery as deeply and desperately as we felt it on nights when we held Joel in our arms praying for hours , stubborn@@ ly holding out hope for a grace that we could not create for ourselves .
no pul@@ pit , no sermons , as there are no cler@@ gy in the Bah@@ á &apos;@@ í faith .
audience : Wow !
we also need more research into medical marijuana &apos;s risks .
but here &apos;s the thing .
so as we look deeper into the universe , we see less light .
I show you the Par@@ kes Radio Telescope , affection@@ ately known as &quot; The D@@ ish . &quot;
these are real radio colors .
and if you look right in the center between those two plumes , you &apos;ll see a galaxy just like our own .
if we looked in the visible , we wouldn &apos;t even know they were there , and they &apos;re thousands of times larger than the host galaxy .
this video would go on to kic@@ k-@@ start negotiation talks with Boko Haram .
sadly , nearly 200 of them still remain missing .
make no mistake : the Flint water crisis is one of the most e@@ gre@@ gious environmental injustices of our time .
we &apos;ve known about its dangers since the Roman Empire .
this was science in service to the public .
a local pediatrician figured out that the instances of childhood lead poisoning had indeed doubled in Flint during the crisis .
because if you look closely , our education system today is focused more on creating what ex-@@ Yale professor Bill Der@@ e@@ sie@@ wic@@ z calls &quot; excellent sheep &quot; -- young people who are smart and ambitious , and yet somehow risk-@@ averse , ti@@ mid , direc@@ tionless and , sometimes , full of themselves .
in other words , anyone can be a hero .
and it &apos;s that exact humility that makes us better decision@@ -makers .
and at the outset , committee discipl@@ in@@ arian Senator Pa@@ store is not having it .
and then , later , &quot; It looks like you just earned the 20 million dollars . &quot;
we need many more Mister Rogers .
Thank you so much .
get over yourself ! &quot;
( Laughter ) Like Ok@@ on@@ k@@ w@@ o in &quot; Things Fall A@@ part , &quot; we African men neither process nor express our emotions .
colorful characters , and a good time is had by all .
and I was then able to go and retrieve them to give you that little sli@@ de@@ show .
secondly , you have to bring structure into place .
and by the time you get to the middle , you &apos;ve got hundreds of people who have contributed only one photo each .
most of the cooperative systems we &apos;ve seen haven &apos;t been around long enough to have gotten to the acceptance phase .
we &apos;re used to support groups being beneficial .
I said , &quot; Man , they were small . what am I supposed to do ? &quot;
how in the world were members of society going to help incarcerated individuals back into society if they couldn &apos;t manage they own stuff ?
I started with Joanne , and I met over 100 nurses across the country .
and Brian would have to say , &quot; You &apos;re not going anywhere .
how in the world are we supposed to navigate these waters ?
and once again , they didn &apos;t let us down .
so option number one : so instead of thinking of it as a library , think of it as a place where it is like : do talk , do make loud noises .
option number two was , wait for it , OW@@ L .
because , they said , the premise of all this work was that kids were bored with old libraries , mu@@ sty old libraries .
even the harsh judgment I hold in my heart against my brother or my sister , the open wound that was never cured , the offense that was never forgiven , the ran@@ c@@ or that is only going to hurt me , are all instances of a fight that I carry within me , a flare deep in my heart that needs to be extingu@@ ished before it goes up in flames , leaving only ashes behind .
and I know that TED gathers many creative minds .
to Christians , the future does have a name , and its name is Hope .
tenderness means to use our eyes to see the other , our ears to hear the other , to listen to the children , the poor , those who are afraid of the future .
this is the path that Jesus himself took .
but we have a wise partner in the study of freaking out .
each one is unique , but every time any sugar is consumed , it kick@@ starts a domino effect in the brain that sparks a rewarding feeling .
the neuroscientists saw multiple areas of the brain light up , simultaneously processing different information in intricate , interrelated , and astonishingly fast sequences .
the effect is caused by lumin@@ ance , the intensity of the light in the colors on the canvas .
that &apos;s the question of democracy , and you can see each of these laws at work in any news story .
to read power means to pay attention to as many texts of power as you can .
this is citizenship .
elephants are the only non-human animals to mourn their dead , performing burial rituals and returning to visit graves .
we can cure people of various diseases , such as malaria and he@@ pati@@ tis C , so why can &apos;t we cure HIV ?
once inside the body , HIV infects cells that are part of the immune system .
however , there are two major catches .
but HIV hides out somewhere our current drugs cannot reach it : inside the DNA of healthy T cells .
after months lost at sea , he &apos;s slowly drawn into a massive vortex , where trash accumul@@ ates , a place known as the Great Pacific Gar@@ bage P@@ atch .
so social movements led by religious groups , philanthro@@ pies , and celebrities , like Charles Dic@@ kens , sought to change these dire conditions and help reform the prisoners .
but have you ever stopped to think about what it really means , or why it &apos;s used so often ?
well , I &apos;m involved in other things , besides physics .
( Laughter ) Now , that may sound like a highly uncivil thing to say , and lucky for you , and for my publisher , I did eventually come to change my mind .
and given this , I think one might be forgiven , as I did , for assuming that because so much civility talk is bullshit , well then , the virtue of civility must be bullshit , too .
UV helps our bodies produce vitamin D , an ingredient that strengthens bones and lets us absorb vital minerals , like calcium , iron , magnesium , phosph@@ ate , and zinc .
the psychological definition of narcissism is an inflated , grandiose self-@@ image .
it is also a diagnosis reserved for adults .
he &apos;s a real CEO , this guy . he &apos;s really got it down . &quot;
between each turn , the dancer pauses for a split second and faces the audience .
more angular momentum means she can make more turns before needing to replenish what was lost to friction .

then it &apos;s back out into the storm where there &apos;ll be slips and falls on the ice .
this hierarchical structure is a kind of grammar .
bo@@ ating , military sonar , underwater construction , and seismic surveys for oil are occurring more often which may interfere with whale &apos;s communication .
researchers have studied the brain activity of people thinking through the classic and bridge versions .
and then they encro@@ ach on the facts .
I couldn &apos;t let that stand and consider myself a responsible historian .
and as I said earlier , truth is not relative .
we must act now .
this hot@@ shot employee who can &apos;t seem to catch a break is that company &apos;s technology .
they expect people will use them , it will create time savings , and people will become genuinely better at their jobs .
they &apos;re all invisible .
&quot; is that technology actually the team member that everybody &apos;s awkwardly avoiding ? &quot;
so in the spirit of experimentation , Christopher set up one-hour appointments , coffee optional , for his team members to have no agenda but to get to know their HR system .
other people , they searched online for things that they weren &apos;t clear about .
so I asked you about that picture , and you said nobody was supposed to see that picture .
do you feel guilt about that ?
did you have body issues when you were growing up ?
( Applause ) GK : I know you learn a lot from winning , but what have you learned from losing ?
yeah .
in fact , I would argue that these examples might not even involve your memory , because you didn &apos;t pay attention to where you put your keys in the first place .
aero@@ bic exercise has been shown in many studies to decrease amyloid beta in animal models of the disease .
the media covers the phone call , and then the ensuing diplomatic backlash leaves Washington and Europe re@@ eling .

we could change it and make it Se@@ att@@ le-@@ Florida , that day , in real time .
CA : so leaving aside regulation for a second , in terms of the technology alone , the time when someone will be able to buy one of your cars and literally just take the hands off the wheel and go to sleep and wake up and find that they &apos;ve arrived , how far away is that , to do that safely ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : that &apos;s pretty cool . and short term , these aren &apos;t driverless .
if you were to look at it from a helicopter , you would be actually able to look through and see that some of the glass tiles have a solar cell behind them and some do not .
( Applause ) CA : people want to position this as an either or , that there are so many desperate things happening on the planet now from climate to poverty to , you know , you pick your issue .
when I actually did make it to college , I told my friend Bren@@ nan how our teachers would always ask us to raise our hands if we were going to college .
we offer programs for adults on computer classes and job@@ -@@ skills training .
she said , &quot; It would be like another credit card that I can &apos;t pay . &quot;
if not happily , I at least had the means to do it .
so , the best option for your libraries is to put their mission first .
I learned that a Décima is a type of verse that only exists in Spanish , and that it has 10 lines .
I needed to write the music .
but at the same time , as important as knowing where we &apos;re from , is understanding that deep down , we &apos;re not completely from one place , and a little from everywhere .
we just don &apos;t know what OK means yet . &quot;
as if a sand@@ storm had erased all familiarity .
when Paul said , &quot; It &apos;s going to be OK , &quot; that didn &apos;t mean that we could cure his illness .
he snar@@ ls , comes at me with otherworldly strength .
when it &apos;s the right kind of violence , we love it .
in others , it &apos;s a deep betrayal .
let &apos;s look at an example .
so what has this gotten us to ?
same neurons , same neuro@@ chemicals , same biology .
electrons , together with up and down quarks , seem to be all we need to build atoms and therefore describe normal matter .
for example , how does gravity fit in ?
that represents the total equivalent carbon dioxide reduced from the atmosphere when the solution is implemented globally over a 30-year period .
and that 90 gigatons reduced is a conservative figure .
and it &apos;s a story that did work . it did happen , and the machines are all around us .
that &apos;s me , that &apos;s my sister Esther , who &apos;s talked to you before , so we both go back to the birth of this thing .
and could you do it again now ?
when I was in my early 20s , I lost both my parents , which I must admit seems a bit car@@ eless of me now , but -- ( Laughter ) I do remember the night my father died , and I remember the driver of a neighbor who was driving us to the hospital .
and accidentally , I happened to even invent a new dance form which I didn &apos;t realize , and it became a rage .
it was called the Lungi dance .
RO@@ FL , LOL .
&quot; Adidas &quot; now means &quot; All day I dream about sex . &quot;
well , the real world is much bigger , much more complicated than the Go board .
( Laughter ) So this qu@@ easy feeling that making something smarter than your own species is maybe not a good idea -- what can we do about that ?
and in fact , that &apos;s the high-@@ value takeaway from this talk .
he &apos;s pretty smart , but eventually Dave out@@ wits him and manages to switch him off .
if we do it the classical way , we give it the objective of , &quot; F@@ et@@ ch the coffee , I must fetch the coffee , I can &apos;t fetch the coffee if I &apos;m dead , &quot; so obviously the P@@ R@@ 2 has been listening to my talk , and so it says , therefore , &quot; I must disable my &apos; off &apos; switch , and probably t@@ aser all the other people in Starbucks who might interfere with me . &quot;
Lee Se@@ dol is a brilliant Go player , but he still lost .
every morning I ask myself , &quot; How can I -- knowing what I know and doing what I do for a living -- be doing this to my own son ? &quot;
well , let me show you .
well , to level the playing field and protect the competi@@ tiveness of its industries , Country A would tax imports from Country B based on their carbon content .
( Applause )
and here , Georgia O &apos;@@ Ke@@ eff@@ e &apos;s painting of this architectural icon made me realize that if we put our mind to it , it &apos;s possible to see everyday things in a wholly new and eye-opening perspective .
when a detective who had learned about visual intelligence in North Carolina was called to the crime scene , it was a bo@@ ating fat@@ ality , and the eyewitness told this detective that the boat had flipped over and the occup@@ ant had drowned underneath .
if we could just change them , if we could just teach them how to live their lives , if they would only listen .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong -- this is not to say the poor don &apos;t learn anything -- they can come out wiser for sure .
I had seizures in between papers , but managed to get good enough grades to be admitted for an actu@@ arial science degree at the University of Nairobi .
a team of grand@@ masters and top machines participated , but the winners were not grand@@ masters , not a supercomputer .
so we need a leap forward to add a few more crucial decimal places .
that &apos;s dream .
Thank you .
but we &apos;re going to talk about it and invite you into an inside conversation today because it is necessary , and because we need you .
it felt good to be out there , to walk . &quot;
( Applause ) VG : so how did we take this simple idea of walking and start a revolution that would catch a fire in neighborhoods across America ?
once walking , those women get to organizing , first their families , then their communities , to walk and talk and solve problems together .
TMD : we know one woman can make a difference , because one woman has already changed the world , and her name is Harriet Tubman .
our walking is for healing , for joy , for fresh air , quiet time , to connect and disconnect , to worship .
so if you got sick in the city where those few doctors remain , you might stand a chance .
our health care system is structured in such a way that the work of diagnosing disease and prescribing medicines is limited to a team of nurses and doctors like me .
he lived in an area where the roads were sparse and there had been massive shortages of health workers .
community members across Liberia learned the symptoms of Ebola , teamed up with nurses and doctors to go door@@ -to-@@ door to find the sick and get them into care .
tech can truly be a game changer here .
Thank you .
they just don &apos;t do that in that industry .
( Laughter ) Every time I look at this piece , I always wonder if my mom &apos;s whispering to my dad , &quot; He finally folded his laundry . &quot;
and this is what the next piece is about .
she looks ch@@ illed out , like she &apos;s listening to Bob Mar@@ ley .
in the city , builders raise a tower .
Thank you .
and this causes something of a problem , because ...
thinking usually costs very little , but this is really expensive most of the time , so by the time you get there , you want to make sure you &apos;re super prepared and you can squeeze every last drop out of what you &apos;ve got .
if we &apos;re really good planners in that system , it seems like maybe we could be good enough to get every part of that system to be 90 percent reliable .
build us some monuments -- The one moment that matters , oh ( Guitar ) ( Applause )
( guitar strum ) You jack of diamonds -- ( Music ) you jack of diamonds I know you of old boy , I know you of old .
one more time !
heaven somewhere .
you can &apos;t speak truth to power if the power speaks truth by definition .
but as the internet has become more and more a part of our lives , our reliance on it , our use of it , has become often more passive .
much of what we know today we Goog@@ le-@@ know .
we need to find ways of encouraging forms of knowing that are more active , and don &apos;t always involve passing off our effort into our bubble .
but it also means something more than that .
it means seeing your knowledge as capable of enhancing or being enriched by what others contribute .
the architect Ste@@ f@@ ano Bo@@ eri even created living facades .
copper has a long history in New York -- the Statue of Liberty , the crown of the Wo@@ ol@@ worth Building -- but it fell out of fashion for a long time until S@@ Ho@@ P Archit@@ ects used it to cover the American C@@ opper Building , a pair of twisting towers on the East River .
their faces broadcast their experience .
I &apos;m a computational neuroscientist , and I work on cognitive brain-@@ machine interfaces , or bringing together the brain and the computer .
in this experiment there are two flickering squares , one of them flickering at a slower rate than the other one .
but what if this person could play a specific computer game with his brain connected to the computer , and then train his own brain to inhibit these distr@@ actors ?
it &apos;s just an impas@@ sive creature taking whatever life sends its way .
I would encourage you to think about sto@@ ic@@ ism a little bit differently , as an operating system for thriving in high-@@ stress environments , for making better decisions .
it was a disaster .
the first page is right here .
that &apos;s a purple cow ; that &apos;s something worth noticing .
well , I would argue that human technologies are really different from natural technologies , at least they have been so far .
human technologies have tended to be large , flat , with right angles , stiff , made of metal . they have rolling devices and ax@@ les . there are very few motors , very few sensors .
it has six legs -- there are the tuned , sprin@@ gy legs .
here &apos;s the gecko running up a vertical surface . there it goes , in real time . there it goes again . obviously , we have to slow this down a little bit .
so there it is .
little is known about this disease , and some people die in their 30s , say some of the reports at the time .
we patented it so that it would be freely available .
and as I learned about all those diseases and all those disease communities , I realized that there were two secrets in health care that were impacting me greatly .
there are a lot of stakeholders with lots of interests and mis@@ aligned incentives like publishing , promotion and tenure .
at ages 29 and 27 , they declare they are happy and healthy despite having manifestations of P@@ X@@ E in their skin and eyes and arteries .
and other times , in the middle of the night , he calls out in a tre@@ mul@@ ous voice , &quot; N@@ ana , will you ever get sick and die ? &quot;
when people respond by saying , &quot; Well , isn &apos;t she full of herself , &quot; just smile ob@@ liqu@@ ely like Mon@@ a Lisa and make both of you a nice cup of tea .
just read about pe@@ li@@ cans and then write about pe@@ li@@ cans in your own voice .
and yet , returning to number one , that all truth is paradox , it &apos;s also a miracle to get your work published , to get your stories read and heard .
and finally : death .
he says , &quot; Take off your shoes . &quot;
Thank you .
it could go any direction .
a simple example is YouTube .
and so think of the little blocks of time that that schedules in kids &apos; minds .
so let me give you a concrete example .
instead of handic@@ apping our attention , imagine if we used all of this data and all of this power and this new view of human nature to give us a superhuman ability to focus and a superhuman ability to put our attention to what we cared about and a superhuman ability to have the conversations that we need to have for democracy .
and this ...
this was ground zero , so that little piece of kit proved really quite impressive , so we got two in a field .
( Laughter ) And then I pin@@ ched a fuel line .
what would you or I want if we were a refugee in a city ?
the numbers are relatively small , hundreds of thousands , not millions , but the symbolism is huge .
it &apos;s not an accident that the country which has taken more refugees than any other , the United States , has taken more refugees from Vietnam than any other country .
it was innate in him .
and my point to you is it should be natural and innate in us , too .
this is exactly why our brains need special protection .
now , if the reference income of a nation , for example , goes up 10 percent by comparing themselves to the outside , then on average , people &apos;s own incomes have to go up at least five percent to maintain the same level of satisfaction .
they understood what it was like to live in a place like New York City in the 1950s .
we can reduce these rates of childhood stunting quickly , but if we don &apos;t , India , for example , with 38 percent childhood stunting , how are they going to compete in the economy of the future if 40 percent of their future workers cannot achieve educa@@ tionally and certainly we worry about achieving economically in a way that will help the country as a whole grow .
I &apos;d encourage you to even be a little more specific on your proposal .
( Laughter ) CA : and what you &apos;re specifically looking for are investment proposals that create employment in the developing world .
I remember my parents had to plan for some of the simplest things .
when they wanted a telephone in our house , they needed to order it and then wait -- wait for nearly five years before it got installed in our house .
we have learned in our work that one of the most powerful means of effec@@ ting change is when people can directly , tan@@ gi@@ bly and emotionally experience some of the future consequences of their actions today .
and so Arnold had to start paying toward the potential costs of that future disease -- potential future disease from today .
in the work I &apos;ve shown so far , whether it was drones or genetic crimes , these stories describe troubling futures with the intention of helping us avoid those futures .
and in its place , we &apos;re building food computers from abandoned , sal@@ v@@ aged and repurposed materials , turning today &apos;s waste into tomorrow &apos;s dinner .
mortality composting is where you take an animal high in nitrogen and cover it with co-@@ composting materials that are high in carbon .
in other words , that cow is transformed .
it &apos;s been cycled back into nature .
six donor bodies have been covered in wood chips , oxygen provided by bree@@ zes , microbes and bacteria doing their jobs .
( Laughter ) There are 6@@ 5.@@ 3 million people who have been forcibly displaced from their homes because of war or persecution .
there was no choice , &quot; she said .
my team loved to practice .
I walk into the cubicle but I can &apos;t reach the lock on the door .
they can &apos;t see me .
reaching up to collect a coffee that I have paid for is an incredibly dangerous experience .
instead , I &apos;m offered sneakers with Velcro straps and light-@@ up shoes .
with the rise of social media , it has given me an opportunity and a platform to have a voice as a blogger and as an activist , but it has also made me nervous that I might become a meme or a viral sensation , all without my consent .
but I am most proud to be S@@ ine@@ ad .
80 percent of little people are born to two aver@@ age-@@ height parents .

but you might start realizing , if you start exploring the space of toys -- we tried these spinning tops , and then in the lab , we stumbled upon this wonder .
that &apos;s when I get excited .
I sold my car , a beat@@ -up little red Volksw@@ agen , came up with some money and said goodbye to my family , to my friends , to my streets , to my favorite haunts -- to my tac@@ os -- ( Laughter ) and I bought a one-way ticket to Los Angeles , California .
here &apos;s the letter they sent where they gave out my number .
Donald Trump : who &apos;s next ? yes , please .
so the landscapes that we live in on earth , as this material is being eroded from the mountains and transported to the sea , are wiggling around all the time .
he was very surprised , because he said , &quot; They haven &apos;t used it .
that &apos;s the space where we do things that make us individuals .
it &apos;s really up to you which ones you stick around for .
I think it &apos;s a fantastic strategy , and we know it works , because when people do this -- and I &apos;ve tracked a lot of people who have tried this -- it expands .
they turn back about 20 percent of everything the sun sends us .
so , clouds play this very large and dual role in the climate system .
( Laughter ) And you guys , we have tried looking up .
and that &apos;s what makes it hard .
see , because her moms had sacrificed themselves to the universe when she was a kid , and she &apos;d been on her own ever since .
so she kind of had to quit her day job . you know what I &apos;m saying ?
( Laughter ) And Stor@@ m teaches America how to quiet her mind inside of a star portal , and when America qui@@ ets her mind , she opens up the dimensions , and in that silence , she can listen for anything and anyone .
she gets to see great pain met with even greater compassion , and that &apos;s right alongside the tremendous strength of her family .
just over a year ago , for the third time in my life , I ceased to exist .
coming round from anesthesia is very different .
do they also have a sense of self ?
so what &apos;s happening here is that the brain is using its prior expectations built deeply into the circuits of the visual cortex that a cast shadow di@@ ms the appearance of a surface , so that we see B as lighter than it really is .
here &apos;s one more example , which shows just how quickly the brain can use new predictions to change what we consciously experience .
you can measure skin conductance and star@@ tle responses , but there &apos;s no need .
what we consciously see depends on the brain &apos;s best guess of what &apos;s out there .
so why is having more data not helping us make better decisions , especially for companies who have all these resources to invest in these big data systems ?
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a never-ending cycle .
she was high as a kite !
that was his initial explanation .
I came to live it , and I am living it .
how did you do all of that and be visually impaired ? &quot;
in cancers , changes in the DNA called mutations are what drive these cancers to go out of control .
around day 450 , unfortunately , the cancer comes back .
for some patients , this hundred days means the matter of life and death .
( Applause )
at the time , we all assumed that these receptors were only found in the nose .
it &apos;s still early , but I think we &apos;ve picked up on the scent of something we &apos;re following .
and so the future changed from this thing we create together in the present to something we bet on in some kind of a zero-sum win@@ ner@@ -@@ ta@@ k@@ es-@@ all competition .
suppose that we can indeed eliminate 90 percent of those accidents , or even 99 percent in the next 10 years .
( Laughter ) We &apos;ve seen this problem before .
one is balance and dynamic mobility , the second one is mobile manipulation , and the third one is mobile perception .
the first three robots are all dynamically stabilized robots .

my mother was 15 years old when I was born .
for me , that was amazing .
you &apos;ll see there are some slight differences in the painting .
it becomes transparent over time , so eventually what &apos;s going to happen is these faces will emerge a little bit .

that &apos;s a very powerful repu@@ tational force .

in this talk , he presents a new technique by which he can combine photographs and produce composite portraits .

see , I &apos;m from East St. Louis , Illinois .
I said , &quot; I &apos;m a musician . &quot;
it may sound utopian , but it &apos;s not .
I found this one case here in one of the super@@ blocks where people had il@@ lic@@ itly set up shops in their garages so that they could have that kind of local service economy .
it &apos;s a street network that allows many routes instead of singular routes and provides many kinds of streets instead of just one .
PC : well , a couple of reasons .
so far , with the pilot program and a couple days a week , and a fantastic human being and a Do@@ dge van , we &apos;ve cleaned up 400 city blocks in the city of Albuquerque .
you could do anything .
here &apos;s the man whose relationship with AI helps him have relationships with genuine human beings .
the human engineer now says what the design should achieve , and the machine says , &quot; Here &apos;s the possibilities . &quot;
( Laughter ) But what if you could have a memory that was as good as computer memory , and was about your life ?
that &apos;s , like , a huge gap .
so simply making eye contact with somebody , shaking hands , giving somebody a high-@@ five is enough to release oxytocin , which increases your level of trust and it lowers your cortisol levels .
and these areas become much more engaged when we &apos;re interacting with a live partner .
now , to return to the beginning , why do women live longer than men ?
so you talk about the neurotransmitters connecting when in face-to-face , but what about digital technology ?
now , we &apos;re probably all a little bit guilty of that at times .
during the hurricane season of 2017 , media outlets had to actually assign reporters to dismiss fake information about the weather forecast .
he &apos;s revered in that region .
and if I was honest with myself , and I tried to be , I admitted that was going on .
you don &apos;t have to be a Buddhist or a billionaire .
and the longer we wait to challenge that idea , the more damage it does to ourselves and our place in the world , like in the workforce , where age discrimination is rampant .
or was Jane really helping John think through what to do for the organization ?
now , music has these parts -- rhythm , melody and harmony -- just like our lives .
it &apos;s very different from if my youngest son were in charge .
that &apos;s the first rule of algorithms .
we &apos;re all racist and bigot@@ ed in ways that we wish we weren &apos;t , in ways that we don &apos;t even know .
we should look to the blind orchestra audition as an example .
I was coming through immigration , which is quite a dramatic border at the moment , into the US last year , and , you know , you get off an international flight across the Atlantic , and you &apos;re not in the best place ; you &apos;re not at your most spiritually mature .
( Laughter ) And 10,000 of them are trying to sell you a me@@ mento of your journey .
so I walked away in my trainers , but I left my boots there . &quot;
and I had a moon shadow , and I was looking at my moon shadow walking across the Atlantic , across this ocean .
it puts you into a proper relationship with reality .
( Laughter ) Are you tired of going to work and making money for other people ?
where &apos;s the capital in our communities to build the types of businesses that we want ?
if you &apos;re an entrepreneur , if you have a small business , or you &apos;re interested in starting one , then link up with L@@ UC@@ I or another organization like us to help you get started on the cooperative model .
when these photos were taken , I thought I was doing a really good thing and that I was really helping those kids .
I had never encountered poverty like that before in my life .
I taught English and bought water filters and food and took all of the kids to the dentist for the first time in their lives .
we &apos;ve learned these lessons before in Australia .
but in 2006 , when I first met her living in that corrupt and abusive orphanage , she had never been to school .
how do we achieve that ?
unfortunately , few Americans have seen one , because it &apos;s been 38 years since one last touched the continental United States and 99 years since one last crossed the breadth of the nation .
you put it on a cooking fire .
and there are now a couple of drugs out there in the market that are used to treat cancer patients that act exactly by this process .
in fact , one of those drugs may well have spared President Jimmy Carter &apos;s life .
to get some inspiration , we decided to go and have a look at companies that seem to be more innovative , like Google , Netflix , Spo@@ tify , Z@@ ap@@ pos .
so then we asked , &quot; How is your company organized ? &quot;
and how do we ensure consistency in the way we do things across these teams ?
and in the old world , there was this idea of thinkers and do@@ ers .
leaders will be all of those in the organization who embrace the change .
Oh , so many . OK .
so some of you may say , &quot; Of course , yes ! &quot;
in other words , &quot; Jeopardy ! &quot; doesn &apos;t ask many different types of questions , but a single type , which we call &quot; fac@@ to@@ id questions . &quot;
CA : well , there &apos;s a challenge for the educators . Thank you so much .
as I thought about my double life , I couldn &apos;t help but wonder ...
I had this little voice in my head , telling me , &quot; You &apos;re too gay , too feminine , too flam@@ boy@@ ant . &quot;
but then things got a little too big .
5@@ 58 people had the opportunity to gaze down in awe , to wonder at our planet floating in an infinite sea of darkness .
three years ago , I set off on my own mission : to see if I could bring this feeling of overwhelming scale and beauty to many more people just by using one small computer in my small New York City apartment .
they operate a constellation of five satellites , each roughly the size of an ambulance , that is constantly taking pictures of the Earth as they orbit at 2@@ 8,000 kilometers per hour .
if we have two over@@ views , however , we are able to tell stories about changes in time .
if I wanted to complete a full digital reconstruction of this statue , I would need a proper camera , tri@@ pods , proper lighting , but we simply can &apos;t do that with crowd@@ sourced images .
would that be enough ? no - for example , you might have two blue and one red connection , and be stuck in the past forever .
you were hoping your internship would give you valuable life experience .
but it &apos;s not the more realistically rendered lovers , rulers or workers who have the last word , but the imp@@ ish P@@ uck who queries whether we can ever truly trust what we see : if we shadows have offended , Think but this and all is men@@ ded : that you have but slu@@ mb@@ ered here While these visions did appear .
but it &apos;s fascinating that this is not just a sort of one-off , nic@@ e-to-@@ have special .
the World Economic Forum , the think tank in Geneva , did an interview with a lot of smart people all around the world , asking , &quot; What are the top 10 skills you and I need to become successful ? &quot;
this is not the bright future we envision here at TED -- this is the horror .
this is the stuff we are capturing .
( Laughter ) And we realized that 42 percent is made out of carbon , and carbon , of course , under high pressure , you get ...
and we put this online -- Kickstarter campaign , crowd@@ funding .
so the waste the activ@@ ator , it was the enab@@ ler .
( Laughter ) And right now , the project is touring through China , actually with the support of China &apos;s central government .
at the same time , you know , these kinds of things -- they &apos;re not easy , yes ?
what are these violent extremist organizations offering that other groups are not offering ?
so what extremist groups are very good at is taking a very complicated , confusing , nuanced world and simplifying that world into black and white , good and evil .
it provides tools and scale and rapid@@ ity that doesn &apos;t exist elsewhere .
so we would see a banal conversation with a recru@@ iter start on a mainstream platform , and at the point at which that conversation was going to become illegal , they would jump to a smaller , less regulated , more encrypted platform .
whereas it &apos;s very different if somebody is starting to question and agree with certain things online , and it &apos;s also very different if somebody already has a s@@ was@@ ti@@ ka tattoo and is very much embedded within a group .
it &apos;s vital and important art , but it cannot be the only art that comes out of the continent .
we have to judge our work for its potential poverty porn pitfalls .
first , we &apos;re going to need lots of cheap , fast , parallel computers .
now , if you were to spend a lot of time here , you might want a dashboard where you could do things like make a phone call , move to a new virtual world , check your bank account .
ems look on humans perhaps with nostalgia and gratitude , but not so much respect , which is , if you think about it , how you think about your ancestors .
they can say , &quot; I &apos;m a new short-term creature with a short life . I hate this . &quot;
so before judging a strange future world , you should really learn a lot about it , maybe read a whole book about it , and then , if you don &apos;t like it , work to change it .
since I was a kid , I &apos;ve had a terrible rote memory .
they see their own opinions as just one of many and naturally start asking themselves , &quot; How do I know my opinion is right ? &quot;
but when we weighed the views based on people &apos;s merits , the answer was completely different .
I &apos;m told that that &apos;s the amygdala .
imagine if you knew what they were really thinking , and imagine if you knew what they were really like ...
and in my opinion , it &apos;s going to be wonderful .
he &apos;s just about to reach the E , and he says , &quot; O@@ ops , better go back up and do it again . &quot;
now , can we do that ? no .
but this form was , and it was tremendously disappointing because it came from such an unlikely source .
and this is what I like to call being the everyday advocate .
so when I saw someone coming from a place of ignorance , I saw an opportunity for them to learn .
transcendent states are those rare moments when you &apos;re lifted above the hustle and bu@@ stle of daily life , your sense of self fades away , and you feel connected to a higher reality .
people leading meaningful lives , he &apos;s found , tend to tell stories about their lives defined by redemption , growth and love .
after all , we &apos;ve all suffered , and we all struggle .
he survived , and when I asked him what was going through his mind as he faced death , he said all he could think about was needing to live so he could be there for my brother and me , and this gave him the will to fight for life .
and when I was a second-@@ year undergraduate studying physics at Cambridge , I remember spending an afternoon at N@@ ana &apos;s house in Ur@@ m@@ ston studying quantum mechanics .
we &apos;ve got time along the bottom here , from very fast things there , to things that take a long time over here .
secondly , it sends the boring people away .
this piece is called &quot; Dre@@ am@@ scape . &quot;
I &apos;d like to share with you tonight some of my art in motion .
( music ) ( Applause ) Now , this is G@@ el@@ i , and this is R@@ ei@@ gn .
they can &apos;t be ; it &apos;s part of the human essence .
( Applause ) And like we said earlier , our imagination is the force that allows us to create these places .
the landscapes are tiny and the steps are tiny , but I hope we can take them together .
and I work in the middle of a highly connected network of manufacturers all collaborating from around the world to produce many of the products we use today .
Thank you .
now , we all start life as a single cell .
and those of us who feel youthful longer , it turns out our telomeres are staying longer for longer periods of time , extending our feelings of you@@ thfulness and reducing the risks of all we most dread as the birth@@ days go by .
so if we can invent the bodies to go with that , then maybe there is a future where I and my group will get to snor@@ kel with a fish school of our own creation .
only .@@ 67 percent of the Chinese adult population had diabetes .
I did it .
and it seems that with all this merging of the technology , I &apos;m thinking that in the very near future , let &apos;s say three to five years , it will come to reality .
cities are like siblings in a large poly@@ gamous family .
but that saying is becoming less and less true .
our -- ( Applause ) our realities may differ , but our rights don &apos;t .
but people , like cities , are resilient , and no amount of legislation or intimidation or violence can fully eliminate any of us .
so , I teach college students about inequality and race in education , and I like to leave my office open to any of my students who might just want to see me to chat .
I research students who have overcome immense obstacles related to their background .
and in mentoring youth , he started to see his own mistakes and possibilities in the teens .
at the time , New York was already well-established as a food capital of the world .
located at the border with Guinea and Mali , K@@ é@@ dou@@ g@@ ou first strikes visitors with its stunning vistas and views of the F@@ out@@ a D@@ j@@ all@@ on Mountains .
( Applause )
today , more than half of the world &apos;s population lives in cities .
and then , the trend changes , and the new thing is to live in a farm and have cattle , until it changes again .
so let &apos;s dive deeper .
that &apos;s more expensive .
and what I had learned from them was that the most sustainable strategy for sustainable development is to cherish and to use your very own resources and potential , and not get dependent on external factors .
they were right under my feet : mud , earth , dirt , clay , however you call it ...
and except a small team of consultants like my partner for realization , Ei@@ ke Ros@@ wa@@ g , and my bas@@ ke@@ t-@@ wea@@ ver cousin , Emmanuel , it was all built by craftsmen from the village .
( Laughter ) Yeah .
those are conveyor belts that go around .
this picture was taken in 1982 , just before the IBM PC was even announced .
it &apos;s really important . using applications is OK , but programming is absolutely fundamental .
whether we sell , it doesn &apos;t make any difference whatsoever .
if you &apos;re in a desert , they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart .
if everybody in this room goes out tonight and orders one of these things for 400 dollars , whatever it is , 300 people in the room doing it -- yeah , great .
and if each one of you sends it to 300 or 400 people , that would be fantastic .
and the world production today , everybody combined , making laptops , is five million a month . so I &apos;m standing here telling you that sometime next year , we &apos;re going to make 20 percent of the world production .
you see , public spaces are hardly ever as neutral as they may seem .
she was a soap@@ stone bird that was looted from Great Zimbabwe in the late 1800s , and is still currently housed in C@@ ecil John Rhodes &apos;s estate in Cape Town .
this soap@@ stone bird , a spiritual medium and messenger of God and the ancestors , needed me to continue her story .
now only bu@@ c@@ can@@ e@@ er capitalists from Europe are sche@@ ming of doing the same , but for exports to Europe and South Africa .
they &apos;re called the British birth co@@ hor@@ ts , and scientists have gone back and recorded more information on all of these people every few years ever since .
it includes thousands of paper questionnaires and terabytes &apos; worth of computer data .
the data showed that those children who were going to bed at different times were more likely to have behavioral problems , and then those that switched to having regular bed@@ times often showed an improvement in behavior , and that was really crucial , because it suggested it was the bedtime routines that were really helping things get better for those kids .
and not just tests of reading , but tests of spelling and maths as well .
a paint company donated a thousand liters of yellow paint mixed especially for us in what they now call &quot; optimistic yellow . &quot;
up here -- this is the back of the ground beetle .
the kids are using them on the tablet .
they &apos;re zooming into the pictures and using it for art class , biology class .
and when I got it home , I stood in my kitchen and stared at it for about 20 minutes .
Billy Pil@@ grim can &apos;t sleep because he knows aliens will arrive to ab@@ duct him in one hour .
I would hold my head up , put a smile on my face and never tell a soul .
so you can &apos;t just shake it off .
( Laughter ) Are you ready ?
from the time I was very small , I could feel the magic of storytelling and I wanted to be a part of it .
so we make the movie , anyway .
we scrape together 80,000 dollars , and we make it , and it does so well .
how would the world be different if all of the stories were told ?
and yet , Par@@ amount and Fox recently released their sl@@ ates , and of the 47 films that they will release between now and 2018 , not a single one will be directed by a woman .
either you have to accept that women are actually five percent as talented as men , which I don &apos;t , or you have to accept that there are serious systemic issues preventing us from getting from here to there .
it will be harder for you to make movies .
I had mostly Euro@@ -@@ Americans , you know , with me from Washington , DC .
so the government of Rwanda came up with this idea to re@@ sus@@ c@@ itate a traditional judicial system known as G@@ ac@@ aca .
I am convinced that Africa &apos;s further transformation , Africa &apos;s advancement , rests simply in the acknowledgment , validation and main@@ streaming of Africa &apos;s own traditional , authentic , original , indigenous knowledge in education , in research , in policy making and across sectors .
yeah ? OK .
&quot; I. &quot;
yet somehow it still exists in a vulnerable environment .
as Khmer artists work to revive our culture and country , we find that there are many paths in which to move forward into the future .
( Laughter ) Here are five things you must know for surviving the impending Chinese millennial invasion .
90 million .
that &apos;s a lot .
I even used ch@@ op@@ sticks to eat Geor@@ gian barbecue when I was inter@@ ning here in Atlanta .
how could they give teachers snapshots of insight to help them better focus their individualized learning ?
ask him to play this game with you .
and Benjamin per@@ ked up and said , &quot; Yes ! and did you see that I made my car out of a pickle ?
from 18@@ 70 to 1970 , the percent of American workers based on farms fell by 90 percent , and then again from 1950 to 2010 , the percent of Americans working in factories fell by 75 percent .
but if you work is better done by a robot , or your decisions better made by an AI , what are you supposed to be doing ?
and that dreaming is an important part of what separates us from machines .
some of us sign and voice , some of us just sign , but no one way is superior to the other .
I cannot stand all the constant misogyny .
in my work , I talk often about the notion that the future is female .
I didn &apos;t know what to do at that short moment , but I knew that I could not leave her alone there when she said , &quot; E@@ una , I can &apos;t feel my legs . &quot;
and the effect of hearing these horrible stories over and over in@@ stilled one word in a young mind : &quot; enemy . &quot;
referring to the cartoon that I just showed you .
North Koreans and I were not ambassadors of our countries , but I believe that we were representing the human race .
this is why we should care about calories , not about mass .
China seemed to be on a very similar path to India until the start of the 21st century , where it suddenly flipped .
by 20@@ 23 , Africa &apos;s population is fore@@ ca@@ sted to overtake that of India &apos;s and China &apos;s .
and very soon , it won &apos;t matter how much money you have or how big you are to make optimal decisions and maximize probability of success in reaching your intended goal .
but the thing is , there was no money in it .
he was a math major in college who had a good heart , and decided he wanted to get a sociology PhD , came to the University of Chicago .
and the mantra was : shoot first ; ask questions later .
now , the group I really want you to think about , though , are the ones at the bottom -- the foot soldiers .
and important to note is that almost all of the weight , all of the people in this organization are at the bottom -- just like McDonald &apos;s .
it really is not fiction -- it &apos;s fact .
let me do one last thing I hadn &apos;t thought I &apos;d have time to do , which is to talk about what we learned more generally about economics , from the study of the gang .
( music ) And I was spending a lot of time , way too much time , in front of a screen for work that would be presented on a screen , and I had this great need to get my hands back on the work again .
and you spin this drum , and you look through the slits into the inside of the drum , and you see the animation pop to life .
( Laughter ) How did we get here ?
that doesn &apos;t mean a young whale only interacts with her relatives .
the relationships don &apos;t go much beyond mating - she and her calves stay with her family , while the male returns to his own mother .
a veteran of several expeditions , Amundsen had long dreamed of reaching the North Pole .
but we didn &apos;t get in our car .
and the fact that we were too poor to have our own car -- that was a story he told himself .
that is more voters than voted on the Democratic side of the ticket in 2014 .
the first is finances .
sometimes you just get tired of trying .
and we announced that we were going to fly Stephen Hawking .
we had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane .
we are living on a precious jewel , and it &apos;s during our lifetime that we &apos;re moving off this planet .
getting married ?
these vastly different fields share a common connection -- epi@@ genetics .
DNA is one of the those things that does not dissolve .
I realized that this is actually how I learn languages myself .
does that sound like a miracle ?
and Chad says , &quot; Sure , like , we have this , like , salmon , that &apos;s , like , rolled in this , like , was@@ ab@@ i , like , crust .
( Laughter ) And , &quot; How swollen is your vul@@ va ? &quot;
he just sat there watching me cry for an hour .
it &apos;s your birthday present . &quot;
they handcuffed him to a chair , and they t@@ acked his penis to a table with a six-@@ inch nail , then left him there to bleed to death .
these particles -- you can see it right now , but when they &apos;re out there in the air , you won &apos;t see them .
we advanced the technology and created this into this version that would capture pollution from static sources of pollution , like a diesel generator .
they said , &quot; Let &apos;s do a global art campaign with the inks that you are making off this pollution . &quot;
my subsequent choices put me on the fast track to prison life .
by the end of the 14th century , Al@@ pine cheese from the G@@ ru@@ y@@ ere region of Switzerland had become so profitable that a neighboring state invaded the G@@ ru@@ y@@ ere highlands to take control of the growing cheese trade .
because when more people vote , together , we make better decisions for our communities .
they &apos;re the folks who buy the technology that we use to cast and count ball@@ ots .
what do you call this person ? &quot;
why ? because strong performance currency raises your level of visibility in the environment , as I said earlier , such that a sponsor may be attracted to you .
a mentor , frankly , is a nice to have , but you can survive a long time in your career without a mentor , but you are not going to asc@@ end in any organization without a sponsor .
but his vast army had grown br@@ ash .
the grandmother was incredibly fond , deeply in love with this little girl .
it was very obvious , from the beginning , that she was a leader .
they would actually cover the windows every night , so that light couldn &apos;t be seen , because the South Korean government has said for years that the North Koreans may invade at any time .
and this man came to the door and kind of bar@@ ked something in Korean .
so , these two came to lunch and we got thrown out of the restaurant .
and I said , &quot; Look , I will fly my friends over here from the United States if you want to meet them , to see if you approve of them .
and he said , &quot; She &apos;s telling me that I &apos;m messy and I have to clean up my room . &quot;
and Gene turns around and says , &quot; We &apos;re not going to make it . &quot;
focusing on the sticks makes us not see that the real tool is the bubble itself .
one day , she noticed that the body of penguins leaves a trail of bubbles when they swim and asked why .
a male firefly glows above a field on a summer &apos;s night , emitting a series of enticing flashes .
the leaf@@ -@@ tailed gecko and the octopus fool viewers by blending into the surfaces on which they rest .
this bird sits atop tall trees in the Kal@@ a@@ hari Desert , surveying the landscape for predators and calling when it senses a threat .
biologists have even noticed that its blu@@ ffs are tactical : newly mol@@ ted mantis shrimp are more likely to blu@@ ff against smaller rivals , who are especially likely to be driven away .
first , this is what happens when somebody overdoses .
so , this might have been not only the first time you &apos;ve over@@ dos@@ ed , it might have been the third , fourth or fifth time that we , personally , have revived you .
and we often downplay the importance of intersec@@ tionality .
so , I did it .
what &apos;s the regulation of the reserve and what is the regulation of the parks ?
tried to protect our equipment , tried to protect our staff and the villages of about 1,500 people .
and I was sending news , doing whatever , reporting daily to the U.N. , to UNESCO , to our institution in New York , what have been going .
and they can &apos;t go even to university .
of course not .
or my favorite , &quot; Those climate scientists are just in it for the money . &quot;
are we both parents ?
do we enjoy the same outdoor activities : hiking , biking , fishing , even hunting ?
the only reason why I care about a changing climate is because of who I already am .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) These values , though -- they have to be genuine .
well , there &apos;s no silver bullet , as they say , but there &apos;s plenty of silver buck@@ shot .
Thank you .
some begin to notice an improvement in their symptoms after just one session , while others take longer to respond .
neurons in the brain communicate via electrical signals , which influence our brain chemistry , contributing to mood and behavior .
if we looked in the world of 1945 and looked at the map of capitalist economies and democratic poli@@ ties , they were the rare exception , not the norm .
I hope the questions will give me an opportunity .
in our world .
so you can only get so far , I think , in telling your story by using these abstract statistics .
I &apos;m going to talk about a technology that we &apos;re developing at Oxford now , that we think is going to change the way that computer games and Hollywood movies are being made .
and you can see he looks always the same .
so we put quite a bit of biom@@ echanical knowledge into this thing , and tried to make it as realistic as possible .
nothing really interesting , basically .
and now from the left -- and it falls differently .
and , I think , we &apos;re only there if we can have something like ballet dancing .
that &apos;s just the simulation creating this itself , basically .
not quite John Tra@@ vol@@ ta yet , but we &apos;re working on that as well , so thanks very much for your time .
I thought I &apos;d tell you a little about what I like to write .
it happened -- I was in the park , and I was dressed in my biblical clothing , so sand@@ als and sort of a white robe , you know , because again , the outer affects the inner .
so if we are to find any meaning in this book , then we have to really engage it , and wrestle with it .
the problem persists today , and we &apos;ve seen it most recently in the fore@@ closure crisis .
and what we faced was the wholesale violation , not just of human rights , but all the way to ethnic cleansing and genocide , and that has been ad@@ judi@@ cated in the highest war crimes court in the world .
and they &apos;ve created a massive economy for themselves and an amazing amount of income .
CH : an algorithm that includes journalistic investigation -- CA : I don &apos;t really know how they do it , but somehow , you know -- filter out the crap !
you &apos;ve had a chance to speak with so many people across the world .
I was speaking to the outgoing president of Liberia today , &#91; Ellen Johnson Sir@@ leaf , &#93; who -- ( Applause ) in three weeks &apos; time , will be one of the very rare heads of an African country who actually abi@@ des by the constitution and gives up power after her prescribed term .
( Applause ) CA : Thank you . CH : that was really lovely .
but what about fast-@@ moving plants ?
this is a plant that moves quickly , which is rare , and it &apos;s carnivorous , which is also rare .
and so I want you to remember the shape of what we &apos;ll be looking at right here , because this is going to be important .
and so the idea is that there &apos;s a high probability , if there &apos;s a fly inside of there , they &apos;re going to be quick together , and so when it gets the first action potential , it starts counting , one , two , and if it gets to 20 and it doesn &apos;t fire again , then it &apos;s not going to close , but if it does it within there , then the flytrap will close .
the other rows of cells are empty ... for now .
so let &apos;s take the numbers in the fourth and fifth cells and multiply down from there .
fant@@ astically paradoxical creatures crawl , run , and fly around you .
( audience ) Mon@@ dri@@ an .
nerds .
but what I will say is that puzzles can be found in the most unexpected of places .
how many of you have a book ?
and not a single one had a book in their hands .
and when India &apos;s T@@ oni Mor@@ rison , the great writer Maha@@ swe@@ ta Dev@@ i died , our readers found a short story by her as soon as news hit .
he was convinced he had stories in his mind .
second , it takes a village to raise a healthy environment .
imagine that you are in Las Vegas , in a cas@@ ino , and you decide to play a game on one of the cas@@ ino &apos;s computers , just like you might play sol@@ it@@ a@@ ire or chess .
that means we can play 3@@ 72 games against the quantum computer using your choices .
so during the game , the quantum computer creates this fluid combination of heads and tails , zero and one , so that no matter what the player does , flip or no flip , the superposition remains intact .
we do not experience this fluid quantum reality in our everyday lives .
( Applause ) And here in the United States , women are on fire .
and just because it hasn &apos;t been figured out yet doesn &apos;t mean you won &apos;t .
if the virus inv@@ ades again , the scout complex recognizes it immediately , and Cas9 swiftly destroys the viral DNA .
but I hope that we shall look , and with any -- we probably won &apos;t find anything , none of these spec@@ ulations may have any basis in fact .
we can -- as soon as we have a little bit more understanding of genetic engineering , one of the things you can do with your take-@@ it-@@ home , do-it-yourself genetic engineering kit -- ( Laughter ) -- is to design a creature that can live on a cold satellite , a place like Europa , so we could colonize Europa with our own creatures .
what have I lost ?
and indeed , it &apos;s this part of the brain , the core of the nucleus ac@@ cu@@ mb@@ ens , that is becoming active as you &apos;re measuring your gains and losses .
and so , there &apos;s one thing that makes me pursue my understanding of human nature , and this reminds me of it .

what we &apos;re doing in that second group is highlighting that a transition is happening .
so now that I was 4,000 dollars in the hole , I did two things .
those are my tips for you .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple kind of notions of how we organize things .
it &apos;s transparent , and it allows you to understand , I think , what is always the most interesting thing in any building , which is the actual construc@@ tional processes that make it .
10 of these -- it &apos;s just under a million square feet -- 800 and some thousand square feet -- 10 of these would power Sa@@ us@@ ali@@ to -- the delta on this .
and that the building itself is occupied in the lower portion , broken up by a series of courts , and it &apos;s five acres of uninterrupted , horizontal space for their administrative offices .
how could somebody read using their fingertips ?
if , for instance , I didn &apos;t want you to look at my right hand , then I don &apos;t look at it .

( e@@ there@@ al music ) ( Pit@@ ch rises with acceleration ) C@@ ars are a metaphor of time , distance and journey , of setting out and returning , of anticipation and adventure , but , at the same time , of intelligence and complexity , of human intuition and accomplishment .
this process produces an incredible amount of energy , and in some materials the neutrons produced by one fission are absorbed by nearby atoms , splitting additional nuclei .
I had no role models , absolutely none .
I said , &quot; Well , how many words do I get ? &quot;
well , for more than 60 years , psychology worked within the disease model .
it &apos;s all like French vanilla ice cream : the first taste is 100 percent ; by the time you &apos;re down to the sixth taste , it &apos;s gone .
and we think there &apos;s a recipe for it , and it &apos;s knowing what your highest strengths are -- again , there &apos;s a valid test of what your five highest strengths are -- and then re-@@ crafting your life to use them as much as you possibly can .
she &apos;s working her way through college .

when the life stress inventory was built , back then , a long-term relationship pretty much equated to a marriage .
we connected .

when I was in the sixth grade , I got into a fight at school .
she gave me a moment to collect my breath and asked , &quot; What happened ? &quot;
volunteer at a school and establish culturally competent and gender responsive discussion groups with black girls , Lat@@ inas , indigenous girls and other students who experience margin@@ alization in schools to give them a safe space to process their identities and experiences in schools .
but you already know that .
in my experience , to have eyes wide open is to hold a broken heart every day .
that means 20 to 30 percent more food from the same garden or the same field .
let &apos;s follow the thread to climate .
( Laughter ) Th@@ ough we probably will .
women are vital voices and agents for change on this planet , and yet we &apos;re too often missing or even bar@@ red from the proverbial table .
you &apos;re an educator , farmer , healer , creator , campaigner , wis@@ dom@@ -@@ keeper .
before she left , my mother had been my human hiding place .
so when she began to disappear for days at a time , I turned to some magic of my own .
or at least if I submitted , they wouldn &apos;t bother me too much .
she replied , &quot; You &apos;ll fit right in . &quot;
as a child , I grew up in a row house next to the busy road always filled with traffic .
and not a single drop of rain is wasted in this park .
( Laughter ) Not many people can say that .
now we &apos;re going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley .
but they lived only 18,000 years ago , and that is truly extraordinary to think about .
we could tell every single human being out there , if we really wanted to .
I have many of these books , and I &apos;ve been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years .
and that idea of a partial glimpse is something that will come back in a lot of the work I &apos;ll be showing later today .
as you can see , &quot; We Feel Fine &quot; collects very , very small-scale personal stories .
so , stories have characters . stories have concepts .
this is in the Pat@@ kot@@ ak &apos;s family living room in their house in Bar@@ row . the boxed wine they served us .
she wanted a change in her life .
and I said , &quot; Wow , and how long will you live in the cave ? &quot;
what if she saw the truth after just one year , what would she do for the next 35 years in her life ?
it &apos;s a great sm@@ ack@@ down of multitasking , isn &apos;t it , often attributed to the Roman writer Publi@@ li@@ us Sy@@ rus , although you know how these things are , he probably never said it .
Archimedes -- he &apos;s wrestling with a difficult problem .
so in the 1970s , he originally trained as a doctor , but then he wrote novels and he directed the original &quot; West@@ world &quot; movie .
over the last few decades , she &apos;s blurred boundaries , mixed genres , won prizes , danced to the music of everybody , from Philip Glass to Billy Joel .
pick up a couple of cardboard boxes .
it is actually a signal emotion .
on the other hand , girls learn to be def@@ er@@ ential , and anger is incompatible with def@@ erence .

his parents were there , but they never intervened before the fact .
we can be angry at our mothers .
I &apos;m here to tell you how change is happening at a local level in Pakistan , because women are finding their place in the political process .
and I felt so helpless at that time .
and most of the family members and friends were suggesting , &quot; S@@ had , stop working .
I started visiting the camps almost every day , until the internally displaced persons started to go back to their place of origin .
and you know what ?
but this shift is historic .
Thank you .

longitudinal data would open up a new dimension and allow abnormalities to be detected based on a patient &apos;s own medical history .
the winds push the ocean beneath them into the same rotating gy@@ res .
her reports would shock the nation and launch her career as an investigative journalist , civic leader , and civil rights advocate .
her friends , for example , had been lynched when their grocery store became popular enough to divert business from a white competitor .
and you &apos;re on the outside , you &apos;re at home .
they &apos;ve made a selection .
but that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
in the summer , you go to the beach .
it transforms through the magic of lighting .
my daddy was a minister , and they were real partners .
there was no home for the aged in our hometown .
( Laughter ) And so if you just follow the need , you will never lack for something to do or a real purpose in life .
but the reinforced lesson was that God runs a full employment economy , and that if you just follow the need , you will never lack for a purpose in life , and that has been so for me .
those seven areas of biological sex all have so much variation , yet we only get two options : male or female .
( Laughter ) If my skeleton is discovered thousands of years from now , I &apos;ll be labeled male .
how many times have you seen kids play with the &quot; wrong &quot; toys for their gender ?
( Laughter ) But let &apos;s just say it &apos;s fine .
I &apos;m not saying that doctors are bad or evil .
we &apos;re not problems that need to be fixed .
the other issue is that these adhesives are all permanent .
well , actually , in this specific case , this is a place we do not want to be , but we &apos;d like to replace this .
so first of all , you would need an adhesive that is going to set in a wet environment .
it &apos;s also to illustrate that this is why I am a scientist and not an artist .
and on top of all the regulations , we had to use stone by code and our experience was limited , but we had incredible references to learn from , some coming from the city itself or from nearby landscapes or other remote places that had impacted our education as architects , and maybe you recognize here .
they are the leftovers of an extraction sequence : the ugly parts that nobody wants .
we need to control just those aspects that are critical , like the structural , the thermal , the acou@@ stical properties embedded in the form .
hearing about these things happening on the set in the front , I was the guy , you know , moving the rabbit ears for my dad , and my sister and my mom .
because representation does matter .
it &apos;s really amazing that all this stuff is here .
however , your brain isn &apos;t doubling every two years .
they &apos;re going through the machine .
so first of all , the first stage that we &apos;ve seen of the Internet was that it was going to link computers .
( Applause )
then you have this double take and see that it &apos;s actually something that existed in time .
so , what you have is that when the pore is open , you get some current sometimes .
when K@@ are@@ em moves his head to the right , you will see this blue activity there ; it represents regions where the contrast is increasing in the image , that &apos;s where it &apos;s going from dark to light .
so for example , if we take a symmetrical molecule , where the two polymer chains are similar length , the natural self-assembled structure that is formed is a long , mean@@ dering line , very much like a fingerprint .
this all sounds abstract .
then we develop an algorithm that understands what makes those top performers unique .
and I mean , I know muscle memory dict@@ ates where I position my lips in order to -- ( Beatboxing ) but I have no idea about the inner mechanics of everything .
the secret to productivity in so many fields -- and in origami -- is letting dead people do your work for you .

of course , even if a building supports itself , it still needs support from the ground .
when escorted outside , go directly to your car .
the counselor diagnosed me with PTSD and told me that the best way to overcome the PTSD was to talk about the trauma .
this is the idea of a representative .
so there &apos;s a big cognitive bandwidth problem if we &apos;re going to try to think about direct democracy as a viable alternative .
what we are going to need instead is to have other technologies that help us deal with some of the communication that we are overloaded with .
politicians nowadays are packages , and they &apos;re full of compromises .
and the nice thing about this is that there &apos;s no deception .
men reach climax 90 percent of the time they have sex .
if over half of women have some kind of sexual problem , maybe our idea of sexuality doesn &apos;t work for women .
something we think of today as female genital mutilation was practiced in the West as late as the 20th century .
how many of you recognize this ?
it &apos;s not about making sure women have as many orgas@@ ms as men .
and if that means you &apos;re happiest having no sex at all , that &apos;s perfect , too .
and visiting some pretty incredible places , places like Mongolia , Cambodia , New Guinea , South Africa , Tanzania twice -- I was here a month ago .
possibilities about our ancestry , but not the probabilities that we &apos;re really looking for .
the first person to do this systematically was Lin@@ na@@ e@@ us , Carl von Lin@@ ne , a Swedish bot@@ anist , who in the eigh@@ teenth century took it upon himself to categorize every living organism on the planet .
so the whole world was drying out .
many are started simply because people are interested in lots of different things .
the truth is that there are many different ways to find happiness through what we do .
but this flash@@ bulb memory , as it &apos;s called , is when all the elements came together to define not just the event , but my emotional connection to it .
and a crocodile walks up a river@@ bank toward its den .
they were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory , because they couldn &apos;t leave it there , because it &apos;s still valuable .
well , this one female came up to him .
I saw a group of kids kind of huddled in a circle .
and she can &apos;t show up on time for an appointment because she doesn &apos;t have a car , she takes the bus , and she takes care of three kids plus her disabled father .
our exam rooms open right to the waiting room , our medical providers room their own patients , and our providers stay in one room instead of alternating between rooms .
cutting steps cuts costs and increases customer satisfaction .
later on , it was Florida A &amp; amp ; M University that first introduced me to organizing .
in 2012 , a young black male named Trayvon Martin was murdered , and it changed my life and millions of others &apos; .
we were a rag@@ tag group of college kids and not-@@ quite adults who had decided enough was enough .
while winning awards , accol@@ ades and grants so@@ oth@@ ed so many egos , people were still dying and I was seeking community .
PA : yeah , we realized many of our artist and organizer friends were also lost in these cycles of sadness , and we were in movements that often found themselves at funerals .
we aren &apos;t very good at lying , and we usually don &apos;t enjoy participating in this social game that the rest of you seem so fond of .
nor that air pollution is hiding a warming so that when we stop burning fossil fuels , we already have an extra level of warming perhaps as high as 0.5 to 1.1 degrees Celsius .
some people say that I should study to become a climate scientist so that I can &quot; solve the climate crisis . &quot;
and the answer is yes .
now , because they are so non-@@ interactive , they will actually escape the detector , so their signature will be missing energy , OK .
but writing was hardly lucrative work .
I like to explore : what does the word &quot; creativity &quot; taste like , or &quot; equality , &quot; &quot; love , &quot; &quot; revolution ? &quot;
but there was hope .
I think East and West , we are losing multiplicity , both within our societies and within ourselves .
they want to divide us into tribes , but we are connected across borders .
so we have an agreement .
I work direct with the right brain .
so -- oh , jack of spades .
but now I do it the regular speed , right ?
good .
we can take some over there later . so now , I will drop the cards .
( audience : it disappeared . ) LG : OK , I &apos;ll take another group .
now -- ( Laughter ) -- one guy laughed . so now , to find the queen , do it this way : take back the other one , take back the queen .
so -- I arrange the spades -- the clubs .
LG : it &apos;s not here ? Zoe : it &apos;s not there .
the number one is , &quot; I have it , you don &apos;t . &quot;
I was walking onto a plane -- this , for me , was a pivotal moment in my career , and it really ce@@ mented what I wanted to do with this whole pu@@ pp@@ y-@@ training thing , the notion of how to teach puppies in a do@@ g-@@ friendly way to want to do what we want to do , so we don &apos;t have to force them .
and the seminal moment was , I was getting on a plane in Dallas , and in row two was a father , I presume , and a young boy about five , kicking the back of the chair .
and it turns out the further back you go in history , the little rough@@ er it sounds .
( Laughter ) Trojan horses on our computer networks reveal all our Achilles &apos; heels instantly .

there &apos;s the solar panels of the cell , some switches that turn your genes on and off , the gir@@ ders of the cell , motors that move your muscles .
it knows how big it is .
so , that answers that sort of first question I was talking about .
the counter serves as a template to fill in a square in the middle of this thing .
get it ? binary ? right ?
this spectrum of identities include identities such as gender-@@ non@@ con@@ forming , gender-@@ affirming , gender-@@ non@@ binary , two-@@ spirited , three-@@ spirited , as well as people that are intersex .
it &apos;s important to know that there are many different types of identities , and I identify as a cis@@ gender female .
when I was born , the doctor held me up to my parents and said , &quot; It &apos;s a girl . &quot;
what will you do ?
and they &apos;re questions that I &apos;ve asked of science television producers , of audiences of science educators -- so that &apos;s science teachers -- and also of seven@@ -year-olds , and I find that the seven@@ -year-olds do margin@@ ally better than the other audiences , which is somewhat surprising .
that &apos;s what plants actually do for a living .
it would be very dangerous if you fell down .

( Laughter ) But guys , if history has taught us anything , it &apos;s that if you can imagine it , you will get there eventually .
( Applause ) RS : so in my official capacity as the chief judge of the An@@ sari X PRIZE competition , I declare that Mo@@ ja@@ ve A@@ er@@ ospace Ven@@ tures has indeed earned the An@@ sari X PRIZE .

I &apos;d get all serious on him and say things like , &quot; Dad ...
so I got to the arena early in the morning the day of the show , waiting out in the parking lot to see if I could spot some wrestlers pulling up in their cars .
but she was always my biggest fan .
it existed in the ways that adults spoke to me when they posed questions in the context of &quot; when . &quot;
I never needed biology to form family anyway . &quot;
in D@@ urban , South Africa , an NGO called G@@ ate@@ way Health have distributed 11,000 three-@@ word address signs to their community , so the pregnant mothers , when they go into labor , can call the emergency services and tell them exactly where to pick them up from , because otherwise , the ambu@@ lan@@ ces have often taken hours to find them .
Thank you .
one of the many things I like and admire in our democracies are the norms that make our leaders hand over power when voters tell them to .
except , it &apos;s not imaginary .
the European Commission has dealt with already seven different car parts cart@@ els , and we &apos;re still investigating some .
they may do that when they hand out subsidies -- and , of course , all financed by taxpayers -- to companies .
since the very first days of the European Union , 60 years ago , our competition rules have helped to build that trust .
how do you react to that ?
MV : well , first of all , I take it very seriously , because bias has no room in law enforcement .
when I look at companies that are moving fast , that are really innovative and that are doing amazing things with agility and speed , it &apos;s because they &apos;re collaborative .
mo@@ vers and Sha@@ kers is a group of activists , artists , educators and engineers focused on using immersive technology to highlight the narratives of the oppressed .
I was also arrested in Gi@@ ants Sta@@ dium for hosting a slave re@@ en@@ act@@ ment at their football team &apos;s home open@@ er .
through a combination of sexy shapes and pheromones , orchids convince insects to mate with them .
when we would go back to the physiological signals we had recorded during the night , we would often see numerous awa@@ ken@@ ings and a severely fragmented sleep structure .
a good sign of too loud is once you start changing your behavior .
also , talk to your children about the health effects of noise and that listening to loud music today will have consequences when they &apos;re older .
many manufacturers will list the noise levels their devices generate , and some even advertise with them .
Hey , when they introduced the ATM machine , years later , there &apos;s more tellers in banks . &quot;
and my point of view after talking to people is that we may do that , and it still might not be enough .
so there was this concept there of being needed .
she asked me how much money she has earned that week .
I often asked my mother , with a lot of anxiety , &quot; Am@@ ma , will my life be different from yours ?
girl 5 : because they &apos;re going to lose all their money eventually .
let me give you an example of this . the year is 1976 , and Warner buys A@@ tar@@ i because video games are on the rise .
since this computer was made in conjunction with the Office of Nav@@ al Research , why don &apos;t we switch down to the Pentagon in Washington and let the Navy &apos;s research chief , Admiral Bol@@ ster , give Whir@@ lwind the workout ?
so , the next time they tell you they &apos;re on to something , clearly they &apos;re not .
actually , many MIT students stayed up all night long working on this thing , and many of the principles of gaming today were worked out .
and they fake it .
they were great TV because it gave the audience a role , something to do .
now , then , this was a horrible misunderstanding of TV on the part of the programmers .
we &apos;re now right into the 1960s .
though some were incre@@ d@@ ulous ... Man 1 : the phone company !
instead of having 100 hectares to make oils or to make proteins , you can make it in these vats at 10 or 100 times the productivity per hectare .
let me end this with an apo@@ cryp@@ hal quote from Einstein .
&quot; from the tip of every branch , like a fat purple fi@@ g , a wonderful future beck@@ oned and win@@ ked ... but choosing one meant losing all the rest , and , as I sat there , unable to decide , the fi@@ gs began to wrinkle and go black , and , one by one , they plo@@ pped to the ground at my feet . &quot; in this passage from Sylvia Pl@@ ath &apos;s &quot; The Bell J@@ ar , &quot; a young woman imagin@@ es an uncertain futu@@ re@@ - and speaks to the universal fear of becoming paralyzed by the prospect of making the wrong choice .
the result would be an incredibly dense , hot , compact universe - a lot like the state that preceded the Big Bang .
a fact came out of MIT , couple of years ago . Ken H@@ ale , who &apos;s a linguist , said that of the 6,000 languages spoken on Earth right now , 3,000 aren &apos;t spoken by the children .
Pal@@ din is a 6@@ 2-year-old monk .
and the knowledge that these people have about the natural environment is incredible .
we have one in Kath@@ mandu , Nepal ; D@@ har@@ am@@ sal@@ a , India ; Tak@@ a@@ ungu , Kenya -- Tak@@ a@@ ungu is one-third Christian , one-third Muslim and one-third ani@@ mist , the community is -- Ol@@ lan@@ ta@@ y@@ ta@@ mbo , Peru , and Arctic Village , Alaska .
and the way we &apos;ve done this -- we teach digital storytelling to these kids .
and we have them tell stories about issues in their community in their community that they care about .
they also kiss , hold hands , pat one another on the back .
and these chimpanzees , living their complex social lives in the wild , have helped -- more than anything else -- to make us realize we are part of , and not separated from , the amazing animals with whom we share the planet .
and these young people , when I talk to them , basically they were either depressed or ap@@ athetic , or bitter and angry . and they said more or less the same thing , &quot; We feel this way because we feel you &apos;ve compromised our future and there &apos;s nothing we can do about it . &quot;
and unwanted pregnancies and things like that , which young people listen to better from other youth , rather than adults .
and the next reason for hope -- nature is amazingly resilient .
and animals , almost on the brink of extinction , can be given a second chance . that &apos;s my next book .
and to them , call@@ outs for civility are really very much like what George Orwell wrote in &quot; 1984 &quot; -- he called it &quot; new@@ speak . &quot;
all of those words .
the frightened parochial lizard brain of Britain .
you hear about giant squid and things like that , but some of these animals get up to be approximately 140 , 160 feet long .
they go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet .
because we see it in bits and pieces right now .
and then we had some hint that these things existed all along the axis of it , because if you &apos;ve got volcan@@ ism , water &apos;s going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor , come in contact with magma , and come shooting out hot .
there are never any lights there , except the lights that we bring .
so here , you &apos;ve got this valley with this incredible alien landscape of pillars and hot springs and volcanic erup@@ tions and earthquakes , inhabited by these very strange animals that live only on chemical energy coming out of the ground .
DG : I already said that this site , from a human perspective , is toxic as hell .
is it fragile ? no , it &apos;s not really very fragile .
conservation &apos;s tougher , but we can probably get there .
Thank you very much .
some people were just plain rude .
and I would like to make a case to you that over the years since we first developed atomic weaponry , until this very moment , we &apos;ve actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world that &apos;s characterized by two phases , which I &apos;m going to go through with you right now .
but we also , in that period of time , added two more members to the nuclear club : Pakistan and North Korea .
this is what you would need to steal or buy out of that 100-@@ metri@@ c@@ -@@ ton stockpile that &apos;s relatively insecure to create the type of bomb that was used in Hiroshima .
well , what we &apos;re seeing now is a level of terrorism that involves individuals who are highly organized .
seven million ship cargo containers come into the United States every year .
but in 2008 , there isn &apos;t one single American city that has done effective plans to deal with a nuclear deton@@ ation disaster .
and I just want to leave you with the personal points that I think you might be interested in .
and the farther you are away in distance , the longer it is in time from the initial blast ; and the more separation between you and the outside atmosphere , the better .
we went down there , and I took one look at this camel .
( Laughter ) Now , if you &apos;ve ever seen a 2,000 pound camel in rut , it is a scary , scary thing to behold .
he will ur@@ inate and spin his tail to spread the urine around and make him more attractive .
and a book@@ mobile -- the size of a van with a satellite dish , a printer , bin@@ der and cutter , and kids make their own books .
the Library of Congress , if you did the whole darn thing -- 26 million books -- is about 750 million dollars , right ?
but we &apos;ve found that the rights issues are really quite thor@@ ny .
so anyway , you &apos;ve got basically an idea of where things came from .
she looks at me like I &apos;m her , you know , her moron child , the cre@@ tin , the one she &apos;s got to speak to very slowly and distinctly .
we &apos;re doing great . we &apos;re doing fine .
we want to curl up and say , &quot; Tell it to me , tell it to me .
it &apos;s a half-@@ whisper , &quot; God , I miss her . &quot;
I came up with these calendars that I sent home to every parent .
people say , &quot; Oh my God , where are we going to get 8 billion ? &quot;
I felt shy , I felt embarrassed .
that was a missile foam laun@@ cher that didn &apos;t get sold .
you see the keyboard strapped to my wrist .
and every now and then , we do something like a , you know , an automated hair wrap machine , you know , that tangles your hair and pulls your scalp out , and -- and we &apos;d make some money on that , you know . and we &apos;d give it out .
and that &apos;s our little , thir@@ ty-@@ cent M@@ ab@@ u@@ chi motor .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m missing to say , but as a last thing , I &apos;d like to say is that if we continue along this path , we are designing our children &apos;s best friends .
they &apos;re incredibly complex . they can &apos;t -- I have no idea of how they work .
you &apos;ve got to know your market , your area .
the upside means if you tell me that five years out , you &apos;re making a million dollars a year , that &apos;s not really upside .
first of all , none of these big , long-@@ titled slides with blah , blah , I &apos;m presenting to so-@@ and-@@ so on X date .
now I come back to you . nothing else to look at , right ?
and he taught us not only that we can make demands of people , especially our public officials .
some of them turn out to be leaders , but not all of them .
we saw that so many more women , young people , people of color , LGBT folks , were all elected to public office .
so , what do we say ?
now we have a small-@@ brained , young individual compli@@ cating this idea .
but analyzing the te@@ st-@@ taker &apos;s overall approach yielded real insights into their psychology .
now , given both the common sense and scientific data calling the doctrine of the blank slate into question , why should it have been such an appealing notion ?
there is no society ever discovered in the remot@@ est corner of the world that has not had something that we would consider the arts .
and how those spaces in between lines , borders , become places .
and this scene reminded me of a saying : &quot; if you have more than you need , you should build longer tables and not higher walls . &quot;
and it weights those together into an attention window , and it looks for the highest-@@ scoring place -- the stuff where the most interesting stuff is happening -- and that is what its eyes then se@@ gue to .
I want to show you my watch . &quot;
they want to take over from us .
half of them immediately started laughing , and the other half started yelling at Abby and shouting things like , &quot; Oh , my God , you can &apos;t say that , that &apos;s racist ! &quot;
and what happens when those assumptions go unnoticed and un@@ addressed , as they so often do ?
but I do remember hearing , over and over , growing up : there are two things you do not talk about at family get-@@ to@@ ge@@ thers .
but I have taught first through fifth grades , and I can tell you , for example , that I &apos;m not going to walk into a first-@@ grade classroom and start talking about things like mass incarceration .
when we admit to our students that we don &apos;t have all the answers , not only does it humanize us to them , it also shows them that adults have a long way to go , too , when it comes to learning about issues of equity .
so don &apos;t take this for granted .
and , of course , it &apos;s one that &apos;s dear to my heart , because all of these sentiments -- some banal , some a bit more profound -- all originally had come out of my diary .
if you don &apos;t have that , then you run the risk of economic stag@@ nation , or maybe even a declining economic spiral , as there simply aren &apos;t enough customers out there to buy the products and services being produced .
so I would say , let &apos;s not structure things that way .
but what happens when a conflict that involved land mines comes to an end ?
that &apos;s the reason why I decided to join the Computer Science Department at NYU , along with Professor Cl@@ audio Sil@@ va to start to develop an app called Min@@ e@@ Safe .
I am here to tell you that I am a statistic that cannot be ignored .
( Applause ) I created a building block out of the ashes and rubble of the demolished houses .
so I enlisted support from an organization called I &apos;m Wor@@ th Def@@ ending : a group of young , progressive leaders led by Alfred and George .
( Applause and cheers ) Thank you , thank you .
if you normally generate electricity from natural gas , you emit about 400 grams of CO2 into the air for every kilowatt@@ -hour .
we need to put in place step-by-step governance for experiments to assess this safely .
it &apos;s enormous as well .
if you &apos;re not confident , you don &apos;t .
CA : and who would fund such experiments ?
that may be a good thing , in light of some of the critici@@ sms we &apos;ve heard today -- for example , in the regulatory context -- of what democracy produces .
he was sure that gay rights could never be won from the closet , and he saw the Castro as one of many minorities without representation in city politics .
and I would have this magical one-@@ word reply , which would make everybody happy : &quot; medicine .
so today , I invite you to follow me on those three steps .
( Laughter ) Us humans are actually one of the very few animals that do this in such an advanced and clean way .
and I frantically started searching if there were scientific papers on the connection of gut and brain .
they just did not have a reason to believe that diversity would help them achieve their most immediate , pressing goals : hitting the numbers , delivering the new product , the real goals they are measured by .
searching your pockets , you find something that might help : a lighter and two fuses you made earlier in the prison work program .
and these are everyday conventions , conventions that are so obvious that we are blinded by their familiarity .
so , this is an exhibition pavilion where there is absolutely nothing to see and nothing to do .
so rather than securing a neutral background for the artworks on display , the wall now actively competed for attention .
so , it &apos;s already sticking out into space enough , and then from that is this , is this small area called the Me@@ dia@@ the@@ que .
so two years ago , I joined the Education Commission .
what about countries where we won &apos;t have enough qualified teachers ?
so this division between content and tutoring teachers is amazing because it is changing the paradigm of the teacher , so that each does what they can do best and so that children are not just in school but in school and learning .
isn &apos;t it beautiful ?
European settlement -- it occurred much later , in the mid-@@ 1800s , and by the 18@@ 80s , livestock grazing was in high gear .
and then something happened which caused a sudden pivot in our society .
( Laughter ) More trees than the landscape can support .
two recently published studies tell us that more than 60 percent of all new housing starts are being built in this flam@@ mable and dangerous mess .
we do far too little prescribed burning , and we continually eat smoke in the summers from mega@@ fires .
where will you go to breathe deep and slow ?
now let &apos;s look at a basic fact of our digital lives , online ads .
if you start typing something and change your mind and delete it , Facebook keeps those and analyzes them , too .
it will dramatically affect her ability to turn these people out . &quot;
now , if authoritarianism is using overt fear to terror@@ ize us , we &apos;ll all be scared , but we &apos;ll know it , we &apos;ll hate it and we &apos;ll resist it .
but if we take seriously how these systems that we depend on for so much operate , I don &apos;t see how we can postpone this conversation anymore .
this is an excerpt from my &quot; B@@ int@@ i &quot; no@@ v@@ ella tri@@ logy : I powered up the transpor@@ ter and said a silent prayer .
it watched in fascinated horror for information , but mostly for entertainment .
to tell you about that I have to talk about this fellow here , his name is Julius .
and what people do is they develop their home on one or two stories , and they sell their log@@ gia or roof rights , and someone else builds on top of their building , and then that person sells the roof rights , and someone else builds on top of their building .
people steal electrical power -- this is Rio .
you see , it &apos;s hard for us to believe anything these days when less than 50 percent of what news pundits say is actually grounded in fact .
I guarantee you it wasn &apos;t a 7@@ 2-@@ way tie .
it &apos;s the acceptance of failure that &apos;s not .
or like the computer programmers at the aerospace giant Loc@@ k@@ heed Martin , who have now written a program that uses 4@@ 20,000 lines of near-@@ fla@@ w@@ less code to control every aspect of igniting four million pounds of rocket fuel and putting a 1@@ 20-@@ ton spaceship into orbit .
see , that &apos;s what happens when we seek perfection .
and over the next few months , I would have three more relatives coming to Canada to apply for asylum with little more than the clothes on their back .
so I went on for the next 20 years or so making a lot of different games .
some of the highlights were things like &quot; The Terminator , &quot; &quot; Aladdin , &quot; the &quot; Te@@ en@@ age Mut@@ ant Her@@ o Tur@@ tles . &quot;
you have to remember that this is not a real island .
and once we get enough of those guys , we &apos;re going to want more fantasy artists that can create places we &apos;ve never been to before , or characters that we &apos;ve just never seen before .
unlike any pop culture phenomenon before it , video games actually allow us to become part of the machine .
( Applause ) I found that video very , very thought provoking , and that &apos;s why I wanted to bring it here for you guys to see .
for example , &quot; B@@ eat . , &quot; the project I talked about earlier , is a concept developed by a drummer and a software engineer who didn &apos;t know each other two days before they pitched the idea .
&quot; judge , I want to tell you something . I want to tell you something .
when you &apos;ve realized there &apos;s a literacy issue .
I had to clean the park , and it was full of empty heroin envelopes , and the kids had to play there . &quot;
&quot; I wonder if he &apos;s had the surgery yet ...
when I came out , I wrote at 10-@@ page encyclopedi@@ c document with a zi@@ p-@@ file attachment of music and videos that I sent to every single person I came out to .
instead , the first step for a trans person seeking physical transition is usually hormone replacement therapy .
now , there is no topic that makes other people more awkward about trans people than public bathrooms .
many of our friends and allies in other navi@@ es and other milit@@ aries have very clear-@@ eyed views about the climate risk .
so the world has changed .
there are more than 22 million refugees in the world today , more than at any other time since the second world war .
now , there &apos;s not one refugee crisis ; there are multiple refugee crises .
more than 75 percent of its agriculture and 85 percent of its livestock were wiped out .
this is one of the world &apos;s largest terrestrial carbon sinks , processing millions of carbon every single year .
I mean , every city wants to be creative , happy , live@@ able , resilient -- who doesn &apos;t ?
the urban renaissance is only going to be enabled when cities start borrowing from one another .
( Applause )
the question that I found myself asking to people when I was talking about the book afterwards is -- when you &apos;ve talked about emergent behavior , when you &apos;ve talked about collective intelligence , the best way to get people to kind of wrap their heads around that is to ask , who builds a neighborhood ?
so when I was talking in &quot; Emer@@ gence , &quot; I talked about the limitations of the one-way linking architecture that , basically , you could link to somebody else but they wouldn &apos;t necessarily know that you were pointing to them .
and so very quickly you can accumulate a bunch of links , and it makes it more likely for newcomers to link to you in the future , and then you get this kind of shape .
and so what Dave Si@@ fry at Tech@@ nor@@ ati started working on , literally as Shir@@ ky started -- after he published his piece -- was something that basically just gave a new kind of priority to newcomers .
there &apos;s too many personal choices and factors beyond our control . &quot;
children born under these circumstances many times end up becoming homeless .
and after revealing himself as the artist , Basquiat leveraged SA@@ MO &apos;s success to enter the scene himself ; selling postcards , playing clubs with his avan@@ t-@@ gar@@ de band , and boldly seeking out his heroes .
when he couldn &apos;t afford canv@@ ases , he fashioned them out of discarded wood he found on the street .
now the doctors can see their target using a PET , or posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography , scanner .
meanwhile , researchers are actively working to develop new trac@@ ers and expand the possibilities of what PET scans can be used for .
local people make vertical glaciers using the mel@@ twater from al@@ ready-@@ existing glaciers high above their villages .
to reuse their gloves , they wash them in this basin of dilute ble@@ ach , but you can see there &apos;s still blood on the gloves from the last delivery .
but is it necessary then ?
it went beautifully .
I didn &apos;t think there would be anything much he &apos;d have to say when we were done .
instead , he had a whole page dense with notes .
it breaks down the fundamentals -- the critical actions a team needs to go through when a woman comes in in labor , when she &apos;s ready to push , when the baby is out , and then when the mom and baby are ready to go home .
you know , there &apos;s not that many good painters .
I don &apos;t know .
I think it pushes forward the idea that the world is a universal place , and our stories become universal things .
but the idea that we would live-@@ tweet our show was really just us thinking that would be fun .
but honestly , it &apos;s a very hard world in which now , as grown-ups , we &apos;re so interested in watching our own thing , and we don &apos;t even know that we &apos;re being fed , sometimes , just our own opinions .
so how do you really start to discern ?
there are so many other ways to give information on those shows .
we &apos;re not speaking English . I need to hear what &apos;s real .
he somehow had to escape that hard-@@ sc@@ rab@@ ble farm from which he was born .
and his great friend Spe@@ ed went to his side and said , &quot; Lincoln , you must rally or you will die . &quot;
but it also brought home to me the lessons which Erik Eri@@ k@@ son had tried to instill in all of us about the importance of finding balance in life .
but it was too late .
first of all , I &apos;d like to thank TED for having given me the opportunity to be here today .
the straight answer is no .
AGF : absolutely not .
and -- I was a woman .
but there &apos;s always the question : what came first ?
they can still coexist with each other .
I said , &quot; I want to study chemistry . &quot;
&quot; well , you shouldn &apos;t study chemistry because this is for boys .
so put these to work for the continent .
CA : so instead of looking ahead to , &quot; If he does that , I will do that , &quot; it &apos;s more saying , &quot; Here is what looks like a winning pattern , here is what looks like a winning pattern . &quot;
we drive this road 20 times , we put all this data into the computer brain , and after a few hours of processing , it comes up with behavior that often sur@@ passes human agility .
the dream is that humans can rise to just a new level of empowerment and discovery .
because of ir@@ regul@@ arities in the seafloor and the swell itself , few barrels last as long as the legendary 27@@ -@@ second ride off the coast of Namibia .
( Laughter ) Oh , sorry .
according to popular reports , her last words were , &quot; Mr. President , how long must women wait for liberty ? &quot; though full voting inclusion would take decades , in 19@@ 20 , Congress rati@@ fied the 19th amendment , finally granting women the right to vote .
and I &apos;m going to put back in the rest of the adjec@@ tives for emphasis .
for example , rich white women are probably much better off in society than poor white men , and rich black men are probably somewhere in between .
it &apos;s everyone &apos;s favorite flaw , it &apos;s that now quite common response to the difficult , final question at job interviews : &quot; my biggest weakness ?
what does it say about us and our society that there is a kind of celebration in perfection ?
opportunity , meritocracy , the self-@@ made person , hard work .
but it is , of course , complete fiction .
yet , no matter how well John achieved , he always seemed to recast his successes as ab@@ ject failures , and in meetings with me , he would talk openly about how he &apos;d let himself and others down .
so that &apos;s right , folks , you can measure this , and it essentially captures three core elements of perfectionism .
but socially prescribed perfectionism saw the largest increase , and by far .
it was in the adults in the room .
( Laughter ) In my lab , I can shoot at rocks using cann@@ ons like this one .
most of the time , the disk is different from the planet , and it looked like making our Moon this way would be an astronomical coincidence , and it was just hard for everyone to accept the idea that the Moon &apos;s special connection to Earth was an accident .
and by making a mental space where I could try out outrageous ideas and then bring them back into the real world to test them , I could learn .
you think it &apos;s very simple , don &apos;t you ?
we &apos;re seeing not a marginal , underprivileged , vulnerable African woman trader by the side of the road -- no .
instead , she diagnosed me with an incurable neurological disorder , Tourette syndrome .
in our lifetimes , we are all going to know someone with a neurological disorder .
and it describes how he feels when compos@@ ing is going well .
and it describes the same effort@@ less , spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state .
this is an interesting little quote from Mas@@ ar@@ u I@@ bu@@ ka , who was at that time starting out Sony without any money , without a product -- they didn &apos;t have a product , they didn &apos;t have anything , but they had an idea .
this works with larger poly@@ gons too .
the pattern repeats for each group of new participants , with money from recent arri@@ vals fun@@ neled to those who recruited them .
pyramid schemes can be incredibly destructive to individuals , communities , and even entire countries .
and I had to tell this other scientist , &quot; The data &apos;s too messy .
but even these be@@ hemo@@ ths seem to have their limits .
this evaporation , called transp@@ iration , creates negative pressure in the xy@@ lem , pulling watery xy@@ lem sap up the tree .
and I &apos;m kind of just waiting for someone to come on stage and tell me that there &apos;s been some sort of mis@@ communication , and that I should probably leave .
upon finding out the news that I would be giving a TEDx Talk , I did what I think most people do and watched about 50 TED talks back-to-@@ back , and read &quot; Talk like TED &quot; by Car@@ mine Gall@@ o for some inspiration .
but even then , I have so many friends who are fresh out of art school , having trained for years and are still no closer to creating a career .
and that is , &quot; It &apos;s not what you know , it &apos;s who you know . &quot;
I hope to create a space where people can boast their art and creativity rather than what car they are driving and whether or not they bought it in cash or on finance .
I &apos;ve never had an end goal .
that is until I met Dr. D@@ mit@@ ry Ger@@ ash@@ ch@@ en@@ ko from Harvard Medical School .
it was actually President Paul K@@ aga@@ me and the Rwandan Ministry of Health that made a big bet on the potential of this technology and signed a commercial contract to deliver a majority of the country &apos;s blood on demand .
so when a patient is having an emergency , a doctor or a nurse at that hospital can send us a WhatsApp , telling us what they need .
you can see a 7@@ 5-@@ kilometer service radius around the distribution center , and that allows us to serve hundreds of health facilities and hospitals , all of which are rural , from that single distribution center .
we often tell people about that mission , and they say , &quot; That &apos;s so generous of you , it &apos;s so philanthropic . &quot;
and the reason we feel so strongly about correcting that mis@@ perception is that entrepreneurship is the only force in human history that has lifted millions of people out of poverty .
how popular we &apos;ve gotten to be -- we &apos;re a top-@@ 50 website and we &apos;re more popular than the New York Times .
and the total monthly cost for our bandwidth is about 5,000 dollars .
how does it work ?
down here at the bottom , &quot; Keep , real movie , &quot; Ric@@ k@@ K .
of course , the vote ended up being about 85 to 18 , so there was no real danger to our democratic processes .
and I said , &quot; Well , they don &apos;t all hate it . &quot;
and we actually have a project that I &apos;m personally really excited about , which is the Wiki@@ books project , which is an effort to create textbooks in all the languages .
there is also a very weak force called , rather unimagin@@ atively , the weak force ...
finally , there &apos;s the force of gravity , which interacts with matter via its mass and spin .
the most important thing to understand here is that there &apos;s a different kind of charge associated with each of these forces .
when we include these , each matter particle has two different spin charges , sp@@ in-@@ up and sp@@ in-@@ down .
well , pretty bad .
this theory and others like it are long shots .
but not worrying about rent allowed me to spend my time doing what I love .
and just like humans , they trick , deceive , and some might even cheat on each other .
parents know how to decode those cries .
and what I did was to spy on bacterial communities inside the human body in patients at a hospital .
and at that point , it &apos;s already too late .
but designers are great at taking big revolutions that happen and transforming them so that we can use them .
in this case I &apos;m showing more the designers &apos; work , because they &apos;re the ones that have really been stimulated .
so you go , even in the exhibition , from the idea of nanotechnology and the nanoscale to the manipulation of really great amounts of data -- the mapping and tagging of the universe and of the world .
we were discussing with Keith Sh@@ rub@@ b * this morning the fact that many scientists tend not to use anything beautiful in their presentations , otherwise they &apos;re afraid of being considered dumb bl@@ on@@ des .
and here I &apos;m showing a picture that was in Wired Magazine -- you know , the Ar@@ ti@@ facts of the Future section that I love so much -- that shows you can have your desktop 3D printer and print your own basketball .
I was shocked .
so this hut , in the middle of nowhere , on a beautiful location , was self-sufficient .
and since then , I realized I just want to focus on solar .
think about this on a big scale : in cities , there are so many surfaces .
this confused his colleagues , obviously , because they were sitting right there with him .
and isn &apos;t it a little strange that he required no payment for this ?
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s not true .
when the movie ended , everyone seemed very happy to get up and get out of the theatre as soon as possible .
( Laughter ) This book became , naturally , an enormous best-@@ seller .
and then we wanted to supply facts and information -- facts and information that they could actually receive and process and use to under@@ gir@@ d their conversations .
and they said this : &quot; that we &apos;re crazy , liberal Califor@@ ni@@ ans . &quot;
and in that -- after that , we can move into a process of genuine conversation .
we need each other to remember , to help each other remember , that grief is this multitasking emotion .
now , this was kindly lent to me by Jeff Bezos , from last year .
the perfect office -- again , no cords , as far as I can tell .
he actually sits down with all of his prosecutors to help them see that there &apos;s basically two categories of defendants in the courtroom : the ones we &apos;re afraid of -- oftentimes , rightfully so -- and the ones we &apos;re mad at .
he &apos;s repairing relationships with his family , and just last month , he graduated from Judge Bow@@ en &apos;s veteran &apos;s court .
so we began , through our nonprofit institute , training hospitals around the country , and we found that most people could avoid surgery .
and it &apos;s the volume of food that affects sati@@ ety , rather than the type .
it &apos;s a half-@@ truth .
and if a child &apos;s brain can be changed , then anything is possible .
but as any intervention scientist doing this work would tell you , this work is challenging .
and in many cases , these disparities in child development emerge early -- well before the start of formal schooling -- sometimes when kids are just toddlers .
in this way , it &apos;s possible that we &apos;ll promote brain development and perhaps their kids &apos; language and reading skills .
other tissues like the heart are quite stable , and as far as we can tell , the heart lacks stem cells entirely .
( Applause )
in these hostile conditions , plants that are able to lure , trap , and digest prey have an advantage over those that rely on soil for their nutrients .
as she struggles , enzymes begin to digest her body .
the next target meets his end underground , in the co@@ ils of the cor@@ k@@ screw plant .
also , not all teens in the world take risks at the same level .
so , I founded my research on the basis of a psychological process known as &quot; habituation , &quot; or simply what we refer to as &quot; getting used to it . &quot;
( Laughter ) Unfortunately , it didn &apos;t feel much like a celebration when , growing up , my mother and I would wander past Queens into New York City streets , and my mother with her hijab and long f@@ low@@ y dresses would tigh@@ ten her hand around my small fingers as she stood up against wea@@ thered comments like , &quot; Go back to where you came from , &quot; &quot; L@@ earn English , &quot; &quot; Stu@@ pid immigrant . &quot;
and it &apos;s really about the friendship , and it &apos;s been so , so fun .
to start with what you know , to start with who you know and to start with joy . but just start .
we have a crisis of inequality .
to me , leadership is not at all like that .
BF : Thank you .
BF : Thank you very much .
we couldn &apos;t bring one here to fly it and show you .
and they can be operated faster than the real thing .
if we could convert 0.@@ 0@@ 3 percent of the sunlight that falls on the earth into energy , we could meet all of our projected needs for 2030 .
being from the Massachusetts high-tech community myself , I &apos;d point out that we were hippies also in the 1960s , although we hung around Harvard Square .
that &apos;ll be the end of Moore &apos;s Law , but it won &apos;t be the end of the exponential growth of computing , because chips are flat .
magnetic data storage -- that &apos;s not Moore &apos;s Law , it &apos;s shrinking magnetic spots , different engineers , different companies , same exponential process .
once we understand its principles of operation , and the pace with which we are reverse-@@ engineering biology is accelerating , we can actually design these things to be thousands of times more capable .
all of this is driving exponentially growing economic progress .
it would be able to translate from one language to another .
so let me just end with a couple of scenarios .
I mean , we will have two-@@ to-@@ the-@@ 25@@ th-@@ power greater price performance , capacity and bandwidth of these technologies , which is pretty phenomenal .
we are going to merge with our technology .
now , that sounds broken , right ?
human confidence in the market has the power to trigger everything from economic booms to financial crises .
sounds great , doesn &apos;t it ?
so you may have heard about this test , but basically , kids are given a choice .
so they were influenced by a peer group that they &apos;d never even met .
and a key part of this is knowing how context shapes your behavior and how you can use that knowledge to change for the better .
would you do everything within your power to fix things before they got worse ?
if you think that someone around you is going to help pick you up when you fall , you &apos;re much more likely to see a danger as being smaller .
&quot; I got greedy and I got caught . &quot;
and honestly , that &apos;s really just the beginning .
our voices are silenced in a world that still shows little concern for our everyday struggles .
so stories of black millennials , brown millennials and all millennials of color really need to be told , and they also need to be listened to .
we started exploring new possibilities and uncovering truths about our justice system and how real change happens for us .
surprised , but happy .
but I believe it &apos;s education and communication .
Chris Anderson : Kir@@ sten , will you just take one minute , just to tell your own story of how you got to Africa ?
they think they &apos;re going to change the world , in fact , I believe they &apos;re going to do it .
and in fact , different areas of the world define these generations differently .
or that millennial who asks for a raise after two months because they &apos;re &quot; entitled ? &quot;
and then do it again .
ZK : as we were talking to the vendor -- to try to learn about how you could apply these , or how they &apos;re being applied currently -- he was telling us that , in the military they use this one so soldiers can keep it on their chests -- very conce@@ aled -- and then , when they &apos;re out on the field , erect it as an antenna to clearly send signals back to the base .
you sir , come on up .
but our favorite idea for this was using it in a basketball game . so during half@@ time , it could rain down on the players , cool everyone down , and in a matter of minutes it would dry . wouldn &apos;t hurt the court .
we have a video to show you .
and obviously they were , &quot; Is this what you spent years doing ?
my real mum and dad dumped me and fuc@@ ked off back to Nigeria .
Marcus : the Pan@@ thers .
that is what you are here for , no ?
E : then let me go .
and I remember I met a lot of child soldiers -- ex-@@ comb@@ at@@ ants , as they like to be called .
if this is an ocean planet and we only have a small minority of this planet , it just interfer@@ es with a lot of what humanity thinks .
and in a two-dimensional world , we do know about the third dimension but we don &apos;t use it because to go up requires an awful lot of energy against gravity .
I wanted you to notice that she actually turned to come back up .
but after that encounter I really did want to go back with that animal and dance .
but the patent for underwater flight -- Karen and I , we were looking at it , some business partners wanted us to patent it -- we weren &apos;t sure about that .
what if we could , I don &apos;t know , produce new antibiotics with those ven@@ oms ?
but the science on these devices has not been able to keep up with the rapid market growth , so regulations on the components of these devices and e-@@ liquids are l@@ agging .
e-cigarettes meet these needs perfectly by allowing them the chance to both innovate and personalize their v@@ ape experience .
cloud chasing , also called v@@ ape tricks or smoke tricks , involves producing large v@@ ape clouds with quirky shapes and names , like rings , dragons , ghosts ...
and chronic exposure to nicotine changes the functioning of these systems .
so as an example , chronic exposure to nicotine decreases the flexibility of the blood vessels and changes how the heart responds to acute challenges like stress .
in 2012 , a team of Japanese and Danish researchers set a world record , transmitting 1 pe@@ tab@@ it of data - that &apos;s 10,000 hours of high-@@ de@@ f video - over a fif@@ ty-@@ kilometer cable , in a second .
but if the ray travels at a shallow angle , it &apos;ll bend so far that it stays trapped , bouncing along inside the glass .
that was easy . OK .
( Laughter ) Well , it seems to get the point across .
which we can now , as I &apos;ve explained , equival@@ ently call either robust human rejuven@@ ation or longevity escape velocity .
that will be history at this point , because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans , since it &apos;s been postp@@ oned so very effectively in mice .
and this turns out to be useful .
AG : there are technical implications certainly .
the people on the tracks just continued to watch them .
at the Ph@@ i Ph@@ i Hill Res@@ ort , I was tucked into the corner furthest away from the television , but I stra@@ ined to listen for information .
the second question is , What does the blogosphere actually do for us , in terms of accessing collective intelligence ?
she speaks a san@@ cho@@ cho of span@@ ish and eng@@ lish , pushing up and against one another , in rapid fire there is no telling my mama to be &quot; quiet , &quot; my mama don &apos;t know &quot; quiet . &quot;
and I &apos;d say , &quot; Well , I &apos;m walking for the environment . &quot;
there are two stories in Montana .
and so that &apos;s the message that I had .
and so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me , and that I was going to have to change .
and I know that all of you have touched me while I &apos;ve been here .
come on : those masterpieces ...
where they have the same kind of security to take risks .
so this is a finger bla@@ ster , and you will find that every one of you has got one taped under your chair .
we think playfulness helps us get to better creative solutions .
and there &apos;s a reason for that : we want to settle on an answer .
I mean , can you have rules about creativity ?
something that exists as a series of interactions over time ?
now , this is a real hospital , in a real emergency room .
when kids play tea party , or they play cops and rob@@ bers , they &apos;re following a script that they &apos;ve agreed to .
the mass rape of African slave females by white male slave masters gave birth to a cohort of mixed-@@ race slave children .
they stayed with me .
some people have tried in the 1920s to add things from the bad parts , and it didn &apos;t really work .
he &apos;s making 45 molecules , and he &apos;s looking for a sand@@ al@@ wood , something that smells of sand@@ al@@ wood .
so this is a profoundly inefficient process .
so this fact that B@@ oran@@ es smell of sulfur had been known since 1910 , and utterly forgotten until 1997 , 1998 .
and people are very resistant to ideas , and rightly so .
they said that they wanted to take back control , which was one of the slogans in the campaign .
no trace of anything , gone completely dark .
and I had to turn myself from a feature writer into an investigative reporter to do it .
because you set out to connect people .
and this is not a drill -- it &apos;s a point of inflection .
( Applause ) ( Cheers ) ( Applause )
and here are some of the ethical principles .
I &apos;m not going to read them all to you because I &apos;m not in teacher mode .
but we &apos;re all disciplined by the understanding that the only people who are going to decide , you know , whether I &apos;m right or somebody else is right , are the people in our community in the next generation , in 30 and 50 years .
so it &apos;s this combination of respect for the tradition and community we &apos;re in , and rebellion that the community requires to get anywhere , that makes science work .
and I want to talk about three stages in that evolution .
and Aristotle &apos;s law of motion was that everything goes to its natural place , which was of course , the rule of the society that Aristotle lived in , and more importantly , the medieval society that , through Christianity , embraced Aristotle and blessed it .
CA : you come over to many , I think to me , as this enigma .
he &apos;s the guy put in charge . he &apos;s the Paul Bre@@ mer or the Jerry Bre@@ mer of first Kosovo and then East Tim@@ or . he governs the places .
and I think that &apos;s something that we have to be in the room , whether it &apos;s Nixon going to China or Kh@@ rus@@ h@@ che@@ v and Kennedy or Reagan and Gor@@ bac@@ he@@ v .
SD : black holes are the smallest objects in the known universe .
born in Pro@@ vi@@ dence , Rhode Island in 1890 , Howard Phil@@ lips Lovecraft grew up admir@@ ing the Gothic horror stories written by Edgar Allan Poe and Robert Cha@@ mbers .
more like primordial forces than mere de@@ ities , Lovecraft &apos;s Great Old On@@ es lur@@ k at the corners of our reality .
Lovecraft &apos;s protag@@ oni@@ st@@ s- often researchers , anthropologists , or antiqu@@ ari@@ ans@@ - stumble onto hints of their existence .
we now call this &quot; serial monogamy . &quot;
( Laughter ) The situation where we know the male and female pair together and all the babies belong to both partners ?
now , I had always been playing songs in my head while I was in science class , kind of tapping into this index of pop culture and hip-hop songs .
( Laughter ) So I don &apos;t really know that , I don &apos;t really -- actually , I do my own kind of research , you know ?
I don &apos;t know where it comes from .
( Laughter ) And then performing arts high school .
just because you &apos;re fab@@ ulously rich and fab@@ ulously famous , does that mean you shouldn &apos;t have kids , because you know they &apos;re going to end up messed up ?
( Applause ) Thank you .
some of the most brilliant engineers I know are the ones who have that sort of artistic quality about them .
all that started from that Big Bang . so , the question is : how did that happen ? how did that evolve ? how did the universe form ?
so , we wanted to find out , actually , what is that ice made of , and could that have embedded in it some organic , you know , material .
RG : the temperature of the heat shield can reach 2,@@ 600 degrees Fahrenheit .
so here we have a cycle of a planet which is like our Earth , but is all made of e@@ thane and methane and organic material .
researchers recruit a group of people who had always skipped breakfast and ask them to start eating breakfast everyday .
and they &apos;re really good at it .
but there &apos;s a catch here .
and so , why now ?
but I feel pretty optimistic that we can do this .
but as soon as we took our family to their new home in Vancouver , we all had the same realization : we were just going to do whatever it took to help them be happy .
each night , a local business sponsors the dinner and sends a team of volunteers who help make and serve the meal .
we &apos;re used to thinking about giving as something we should do .
and there &apos;s a lot of them that I actually can &apos;t show you on this chart .
it &apos;ll be very high volume ; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020 .
but there were also revelations .
fish tried amphi@@ bian life . frogs adapted to deserts .
li@@ ch@@ ens arose as a co-@@ op . fungi married algae ...
with this method Mr. Mir@@ o could have saved canvas for another picture .
it &apos;s -- oh , no , it &apos;s -- that &apos;s a really hard one .
there is the statue of a soldier present below , but he is unable to defend the woman and child .
but it turns out I was depressed and anxious because I couldn &apos;t sort my life out like a normal person , because I was not a normal person , and I didn &apos;t know it .
here &apos;s a beautiful project . they really knew it &apos;d last forever , because they &apos;d build it out of absolutely huge stones .
longevity under adversity is a pretty interesting design principle in its own right .
and we said , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s great . listen , we &apos;ll counter . how about zero ?
but it goes a mile-@@ and-a-half in a straight line , due east into the range , into very interesting territory -- except that , as you &apos;ll see when we go inside in a minute , we were hoping for limestone but in there is just sh@@ ale .
another possible approach is right up the western front of the mountain .
you held this organic sculpture up to your heart , and you poured the energy of your whole body into this little piece of wood , and heard it translated into music .
Thank you .
so I guess it &apos;s a world premier .
Bernard Pin@@ ay@@ on Ag@@ ba@@ os@@ i : we have been so deep into the foreign movies .
you see how he talks . you see how he lives .
woman : that &apos;s why I use enough masking tape .
I just can &apos;t tell you -- there &apos;s one thing I want to tell you .
just a few moments .
they actually didn &apos;t wait for , you know , the latest technology .
it &apos;s a very large number of galaxies .
so I &apos;m going to show you the results of a very large-scale simulation of what we think the universe might be like , using , essentially , some of the play principles and some of the design principles that , you know , humans have lab@@ ored so hard to pick up , but apparently nature knew how to do at the beginning .
that is matter that doesn &apos;t interact with light the typical way that ordinary matter does , the way the light &apos;s shining on me or on the stage .
so it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance .
and then , to have to deal with large groups , say , at the nation-state level , and we had to have mutual non-@@ aggression , or through a series of conflicts , we eventually came to a rough international bargain to largely keep the peace .
and it &apos;s only in retrospect , after the better software comes along , and you take it and you run it on a ten@@ -year-old machine , you say , God , the machine was that fast ?
we may not be able to stop it , but the likelihood that it will get past us is lower if we focus on that problem .
( voice ) Re@@ boot computer .
we flipped the design .
as funny as it sounds , articulating it now and reading about it -- actually , if we had talked about it before this controversy , I would have said , &quot; That &apos;s kind of true . &quot;
I &apos;m talking a little too aggressively , whatever , so you know , I slowed down .
but he never controls it .
radioactive yellow .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s like the DNA of a goose is to fly south in the winter , right ?
and I say to you , I might not stick to this , but I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll ever serve foie gras on my menu again because of that taste experience with Eduardo .
and he doesn &apos;t need spices , because he &apos;s got this pot@@ p@@ our@@ ri of herbs and flavors that his geese love to gor@@ ge on .
how come you don &apos;t give him this ?
since the beginning of history , people have felt the need to give language an image .
drawing the letters of this title , I recreate the text &apos;s atmosphere a little .
fewer younger working people means less tax revenue .
these are photographs of things a person touched during 24 hours .
she lives by the sea .
( phone rings ) So now we &apos;ve proven that you can actually make a wearable , not by an electronic company , but by a tailor .
I look awesome . are we done ?
as the car drives by , one LIDAR pulse scat@@ ters off the base of its ant@@ lers , while the next may travel to the tip of one ant@@ ler before bouncing back .
the most obvious way to create a pulse of light is to switch a laser on and off .
I &apos;m the son of immigrants .
relax , I &apos;m not .
as a human , you are always in the market for a cult , for some variety of religious experience .
you start telling your story .
their message is the same : civic love , civic spirit , civic responsibility .
they took up one quarter of the mammalian biomass .
so they are their own slow-@@ moving , miniature ecosystem .
( Applause )
one by one , Lord Death stabbed them in the heart with an ob@@ si@@ dian knife , offering their bodies to their new Lord Sun .
that would keep it from forming the tangles that seem to kill large sections of the brain when they do .
I asked Steve to put a human being in this to give a sense of scale .
and I was a member of a climbing team that made the first climb of it , in 2006 .
you &apos;ve just told us a different story of this tragic arms race that &apos;s happening , and maybe whole ecosystems gone forever .
the first lie is that career success is fulfilling .
now , I don &apos;t ask you to believe in God or not believe in God , but I do ask you to believe that there &apos;s a piece of you that has no shape , size , color or weight , but that gives you infinite dignity and value .
I met a woman named Sarah in Ohio who came home from an antiqu@@ ing trip and found that her husband had killed himself and their two kids .
so what if we put interesting materials inside of these micro@@ capsules and made tattoo inks with them ?
well , if you were to try to tackle that problem with a tattoo , the first step would be to make a tattoo that conducts electricity .
and the fun part -- and I &apos;m quite focused on it -- I tell people I used to be a light bulb , but now I &apos;m a laser -- I &apos;m just going to get that thing built , and it turns out it &apos;s not so hard .
now we have none of those , OK ?
you can serve a couple of thousand kids with two meg@@ ab@@ its .
and that &apos;s very important , because so many things hit the market at a price and then drift up .
if it comes out six months late , so what ?
and I think that Second Life and virtual worlds more generally represent the best we can do to achieve that right now .
it &apos;s kind of like I@@ rene talking about Google being data-driven .
so I think that &apos;s another big point .
you know , an example of something -- pregnancy .
when you inhale , your lungs transfer oxygen into hemoglobin molecules , and the pulse oxi@@ meter measures the ratio of oxygenated to oxygen@@ -free hemoglobin .
but over time , my fear of the dark turned to curiosity .
so we have to choose the most interesting ones .
black holes are among the most perple@@ xing objects in the universe .
these are weir@@ der .
and in SD@@ SS , we &apos;re looking at over half a million supermassive black holes , to try to understand how they formed .
OK , let me just recap .
she must have this industrial machine going , no room for the individual , curious , lone wolf genius , &quot; right ?
you can see SD@@ SS kick in around Y@@ 2@@ K .
it &apos;s very good at receiving new memory files and then holding on to them .
in contrast , those genes that were actually u@@ pre@@ g@@ ulated or increased by way of a lack of sleep , were genes associated with the promotion of tumors , genes associated with long-term chronic inflammation within the body , and genes associated with stress , and , as a consequence , cardiovascular disease .
it is your life-support system , and it is Mother Nature &apos;s best effort yet at immortality .
I believe it is now time for us to reclaim our right to a full night of sleep , and without embarrassment or that unfortunate stigma of laz@@ iness .
it &apos;ll be on display at the Inter@@ active T@@ elec@@ om@@ munications Spring Show in Green@@ w@@ ich Village in New York City -- that &apos;s open to the public , definitely invite you all to come and attend -- it &apos;s a fantastic show .
in other cases , nerves adapt to send signals more efficiently , amplifying the message .
in one study , children who reported believing they had no control over pain actually experienced more intense pain than those who believed they had some control .
hello .
and with that , we can reconstruct my face under a myriad of lighting conditions .
we had to do a lot of capture with this .
( Applause )
it was a like a milk container left out in the sun .
he said , &quot; Ham@@ di , that &apos;s fine , we &apos;ll do that , but tell me you have more ideas than that . &quot;
and we &apos;re going to call it &apos; Cho@@ ban@@ i &apos; -- it means &apos; shepherd &apos; in Turkish . &quot;
I said , it &apos;s not a gift .
I leave the colors all up to you .
to accommodate , their eyes have a much r@@ ounder lens to ref@@ r@@ act light underwater , as well as tear@@ drop-@@ shaped pupils which can expand to 25 times their original size .
don &apos;t want it to leave me behind .
there &apos;s a starry crown in heaven , I know .
and I would sit around with it , and I didn &apos;t know how to play it , but I would just play stuff as sad as I could play .
if you want to talk about it , you know , I will listen to you through .
while you can hardly move , they &apos;re running around having all kinds of fun .
open up now .
( Laughter ) We weren &apos;t stupid : we put up a sheet of plywood about five feet in front of it .
there might not be a word in the dictionary that more of us are connected to than love .
orange : it &apos;s been three minutes . ( # that@@ sno@@ t@@ love ) Katie Hood : anybody recognize that ? I don &apos;t know . I do .
orange 1 : me and my boyfriend always have Monday Fun@@ day .
for the first time , you might understand why you &apos;re disappointed in a friendship or why every interaction with a certain family member leaves you discouraged and anxious .
and when I was 15 , I got my first professional audition .
four years later , when I got to play U@@ gly Betty , I saw the same phenomenon play out .
I thought sunscreen and straigh@@ tening ir@@ ons would bring about change in this deeply entrenched value system .
change will come when each of us has the courage to question our own fundamental values and beliefs .
I am just one of millions of people who have been told that in order to fulfill my dreams , in order to contribute my talents to the world I have to resist the truth of who I am .
I don &apos;t call myself an industrial designer because I &apos;m other things .
and if this is the end of my five minutes , I want to tell you that I actually did survive , which was a surprise .
so , sensors done , time to build a telescope .
God , I love it .
we &apos;ve come up with a hypothetical research scenario for each of these three headlines .
so what makes this headline misleading : &quot; Heal@@ thium reduces risk of heart disease . &quot;
I &apos;m completely obsessed with confidence .
what she was basically saying was that if I am ever in doubt , I need you to be there to restore my hope and to rebuild my certainty .
the thing is , I &apos;ve seen this sort of thing again and again and again for decades .
Google : &quot; the end of working antibiotics . &quot;
this requires a global solution .
it &apos;s also pretty clear that the bees sometimes catch other viruses or other fl@@ us , and so the question we &apos;re still struggling with , and the question that keeps us up at night , is why have the bees suddenly become so susceptible to this flu , and why are they so susceptible to these other diseases ?
but you meet this bee@@ keeper , and I met this bee@@ keeper here , and he is one of the most knowledgeable beekeepers I &apos;ve ever met .
he &apos;s the one who first identified this condition and raised the alarm bells .
it &apos;s said that for bees , the flower is the fountain of life , and for flowers bees are the messengers of love .
they get paid by pollen and nectar , to move that male sperm , the pollen , from flower to flower .
in fact , you know , the White House used to have sheep in front in order to help fund the war effort in World War I , which probably is not a bad idea ; it wouldn &apos;t be a bad idea .
and everyone should open a beehive , because it is the most amazing , incredible thing .
commonly employed off the coast of Chile and in the f@@ j@@ ords of Norway , these fish , like many industri@@ ally farmed animals , occupy stressful , overcrowded pens .
escaped fish can even disrupt local ecosystems as invasive species .
the opposite of a gun is wherever you point it .
we &apos;re moving upstream , closer to the problem and closer to the solution .
in all these cases , the subject is usually white , the target is usually black , and the activities are anything , from sitting in a Starbucks to using the wrong type of barbecue to n@@ apping to walking &quot; agitated &quot; on the way to work , which I just call &quot; walking to work . &quot;
the world is getting closer to achieving one of the most important public health goals of our time : eradicating HIV .
and it arrived , and it was tiny .
10 seconds passed and it was gone .
most of the cars that I drive , if I get up to 80 they start to rattle .
there were some people who were a little less impressed .
maybe even secretly judge whether or not they should be so mad .
we even tell people to let it go .
but instead , I like to think of anger as a motivator .
and we compare simulated universes like that -- I &apos;ll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk -- with what we actually see in the sky .
and so we need a theory that uni@@ fies the very large and the very small , which we don &apos;t yet have .
and it &apos;s this science , which is not only enlighten@@ ing our understanding of the biological world , but also transforming our world faster than ever .
S@@ uc@@ c@@ essions of new species emerged , evolved and became extinct .
but in just a tiny sliver of the Earth &apos;s history , the last one-@@ millionth part , a few thousand years , the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before .
the lottery is an excellent example , of course -- an excellent te@@ st-@@ case of people &apos;s ability to compute probabilities .
it costs you a dollar to buy the ticket and , if you win , you get 20 bucks . is this a good bet ?
now , a slightly different version of this lottery : imagine that the nine tickets are all owned by one fat guy named L@@ ero@@ y .
when people are asked about these two different jobs : a job where you make 6@@ 0@@ K , then 50@@ K , then 40@@ K , a job where you &apos;re getting a salary cut each year , and one in which you &apos;re getting a salary increase , people like the second job better than the first , despite the fact they &apos;re all told they make much less money . why ?
so , they will opt for the item in the middle .
I mean , compared to all these people who hate me when I try to speak their language and hate me more when I don &apos;t , these people are just wonderful . &quot; and so you tour France with them , and then you get home and you invite them over for dinner , and what do you find ?
first it &apos;s an inch in your view , then it &apos;s a quarter-@@ inch , then a half-@@ inch , and then finally they go off the edge of the earth .
that is , as that month 12 approaches , you will say , what was I thinking , waiting an extra month for 60 dollars ?
I think in the case of terrorism , it isn &apos;t .
I know , because I &apos;ve interviewed about 1,000 lottery buyers over the years .
in the German town of N@@ ö@@ r@@ d@@ ling@@ en in 15@@ 93 , an in@@ n@@ keeper named Maria H@@ ö@@ ll found herself accused of witchcraft .
synthetic knee joints may give off particles as they &apos;re worn down , causing immune cells to inf@@ lame around these fragments .
of course , refusing to grow up -- -- even though I imperson@@ ate a grown-up in daily life , but I do a fairly good job of that -- but really retaining that child@@ like quality of not caring what other people think about what you &apos;re interested in , is really critical .
the next element is the fact that I have applied a value judgment and my value judgment is that the presence of life is better than no life .
and also , even perhaps more critically , because this is the only home planet we have , how do we protect us from it , while we study it ?
these extreme physical and chemical parameters make the biology that grows in these places very special .
because contrary to what you might think , this is not devoid of life .
and the future is there for us to use these la@@ v@@ a-@@ tube caves on Mars .
they &apos;re choreograp@@ hing themselves .
here on the model you see the predator attacking .
specifically , it &apos;s male fireflies who are all flashing in perfect time together , in perfect synchrony , to reinforce a message to the females .
on , more on and then off .
but I hope you &apos;ve convinced yourself now , with this nighttime video , that they really were very well synchronized .
boy : about the second one .
interviewer : it &apos;s actually quite difficult to walk .
( Laughter ) And it &apos;s not completely gratuitous , because &quot; w@@ ok &quot; and &quot; roll &quot; -- Chinese food and Japanese foods , so it kind of works out .
for example : beef with broccoli , egg rolls , General Tso &apos;s Chicken , fortune cookies , chop suey , the take-@@ out boxes .
( Laughter ) Even the Brits have their own version .
( Laughter ) And they have things like ris@@ ot@@ to chop suey .
Chinese restaurants have done largely the same thing , I would argue , with the menu and the dec@@ or , even the restaurant name , but without a centralized headquarters .
McDonald &apos;s actually spent 10 years coming out with a chic@@ ken@@ -like product .
we want to live in a world in which not one ounce of our hard work or our pain or our deepest hopes will be for nothing .
they usually talk about the 17th century .
that -- you know , I was born thinking about things that way , and I had always been like a little scientist guy .
I mean , if you can think how important -- If you have a GPS system and there are no satellites , it &apos;s not going to be much use . but , like -- but , you know , if somebody had a GPS system in the 17th century some king would have gotten together an army and gone to get it , you know . if that person -- Audience : for the teddy bear ? the teddy bear ?
not a whole lot of people doing this stuff .
you know , if I had gone back looking for an authority figure who could tell me if it would work or not , he would have said , no , it probably won &apos;t .
I mean , you &apos;ve got to watch out for asteroids . OK , thank you for having me here .
we should all be proud .
relative to a fic@@ us plant or the measles or my kid &apos;s guinea pigs , these microbes probably aren &apos;t doing much of anything at all .
they also make a waste product , oxygen , which we are 100 percent dependent upon .
and our hypothesis was that there should be carbon dioxide bubbling up with it , but something deep underground was filtering it out .
you &apos;d buy that thing , you &apos;d bring it home , you &apos;d plug it in , and it would do absolutely nothing at all .
so , the first time I did that , I went , like , whoa ! like this .
it &apos;s a very nice little book . it &apos;s about this guy , Paul Rand , who was one of the greatest graphic designers , and also a great writer as well .
a very difficult time , actually .
and that little program &apos;s on that cardboard disk .
he &apos;s the guy that kind of discovered me , and kind of got me going in digital media .
you can go outside -- see many other examples .
so -- there were -- ( Applause ) Well , you know , the -- the fossil record is truly amazing because it really forces you to look at living animals in a new way .
so the tree of life is normally divergence over time .
Thank you very much .
if we can get rid of that , then the highways will now be useful to you , as contra@@ sted by what &apos;s happening in many parts of the world today .
we are now installing larger power@@ plants , which will make it possible for me to get back on board .
and I &apos;m afraid there are far more deadly weapons in our near future than airplanes , ones not made of metal .
somewhere out there in the world , there &apos;s a tiny group of people who would attempt , however in@@ ep@@ tly , to kill us all if they could just figure out how .
today , you just need to know someone who knows someone who owns a telephone , because computing is an exponential technology .
because , all these terrible scenarios I &apos;ve painted -- they are not destiny .
I like the fact that the viewer can never make the assumption about what &apos;s real and what &apos;s fake .
especially if your wardrobe takes up a 40-@@ foot container , three storage units and 30 boxes from IKEA -- ( Laughter ) and sometimes , it can be very difficult , getting into cars , and sometimes -- well , this morning I didn &apos;t fit through my bathroom door , so that was a problem .
I &apos;ve had to face struggles and triumphs whilst living my life as art .
there &apos;s the &quot; Wor@@ st Dre@@ ssed . &quot;
( Applause and cheers )
and finally , for the Brits , Per@@ cy Sha@@ w -- this is a big British invention -- saw the cat &apos;s eyes at the side of the road , when he was driving home one night and from that came the Cat@@ se@@ ye .
why do we wrap the te@@ ab@@ ag string around the cup handle ?
and we all , kind of , know how to read these signals now .
( Laughter ) But a really nice way of re-@@ framing the ordinary , and I think that &apos;s one of the things .
so , what I thought I would bring up is another component that needs to be thought of , whenever you think about nature , and that &apos;s basically the invention of generic form in genetic evolution .
my hero is actually not Darwin ; it &apos;s a guy named William Bat@@ es@@ on , father of Greg Bat@@ es@@ on , who was here for a long time in Monterey .
we also used a continuity of change from a main exhibition hall to a natural history museum , so it &apos;s all one continuous change in the ma@@ ssing , but within that ma@@ ssing are very different kinds of spaces and forms .
and I recognized that oftentimes design , when you &apos;re set up to see design , it can be a bit of a let@@ down .
interestingly , they seem to correspond more or less to J@@ ung &apos;s four sub@@ divisions of human thought .
in that sense , yes .
I &apos;m going to show you a couple now .
here &apos;s another one .
given the appropriate conditions , crystals will grow into geometric shapes that reflect the arrangement of their atoms .
quartz , meanwhile , has a hexag@@ onal crystalline structure .
I want to talk to you about how reading can give us a share@@ able world of powerful human connection .
and so I think I turned to James Bal@@ d@@ win as a way to fill this void , as a way to feel racially conscious .
and this strategy actually worked , he started to come to school every day .
&quot; let me imagine that we will come again when we want to and it will be spring We will be no older than we ever were The worn gri@@ efs will have e@@ ased like the early cloud through which morning slowly comes to itself &quot; I asked Patrick what his favorite line was , and he said , &quot; We will be no older than we ever were . &quot;
&quot; days that I have held , days that I have lost , days that out@@ grow , like daughters , my har@@ boring arms . &quot;
&quot; the river is shadowy in some places but the light shines through the cracks of trees ...
but let &apos;s kind of look at these stages again from the standpoint of connections to possibly a deeper level -- all in my quest for answering the question , &quot; What is it about bread that &apos;s so special ? &quot;
Thank you .
we live longer , so new diseases are important .
it &apos;s filled with the kind of craft laws that come from something being the first of its kind .
and I taught myself design this way , and this was sort of my early years , and I used these things in really goofy ways on record covers and in my design .
and I began getting immersed in this project in a way I never was before .
I still work for the Public Theater .
a neighborhood has a thing -- it &apos;s got a landmark , it &apos;s got a place , it &apos;s got a restaurant . it doesn &apos;t have a logo . I mean , what would that be ?
I thought I was going to go crazy at the end of this year .
my first night at Lang@@ ata Women Max@@ im@@ um Security Prison was the toughest .
my dignity and humanity disappeared with the admission process .
living in your genome is the history of our species , and you as an individual human being , where you &apos;re from , going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years , and that &apos;s now starting to be understood .
you might also be interested in knowing that a mouse has about the same amount of genes .
if you have a U@@ TI , you &apos;ve probably -- or ever had a U@@ TI -- you &apos;ve come in contact with this little bug .
they &apos;ve also discovered that there &apos;s a heck of a lot of activity going on producing aroma as well .
we all talk about ter@@ ro@@ ir ; we worship ter@@ ro@@ ir ; we say , Wow , is my ter@@ ro@@ ir great ! it &apos;s so special .
amazing .
so please do not fear the future or the rest of the world .
but even though we can &apos;t observe the qubit in its superposition , we can manipulate it to perform particular operations while in this state .
a quick sampling really can barely scratch the surface , but to give you a sense of what we cover : tools for rapid disaster relief , such as this inflatable concrete shelter ; innovative uses of bios@@ cience , such as a flower that changes color in the presence of landmines ; ul@@ tra high-@@ efficiency designs for homes and offices ; distributed power generation using solar power , wind power , ocean power , other clean energy sources ; ul@@ tra , ul@@ tra high-@@ efficiency vehicles of the future ; ul@@ tra high-@@ efficiency vehicles you can get right now ; and better urban design , so you don &apos;t need to drive as much in the first place ; bio-@@ mi@@ metic approaches to design that take advantage of the efficiencies of natural models in both vehicles and buildings ; distributed computing projects that will help us model the future of the climate .
the last few years have all seen the rise of innovations in how we measure and display aspects of the world that can be too big , or too intangible , or too slippery to grasp easily .
now , why do I say that this is a big problem ?
another author doesn &apos;t give any numerical estimate , but says the probability is significant that it will fail .
and then you can imagine some enhan@@ cements of human capacities .
then you could live sorts of lives and accumulate wis@@ doms that are just not possible for humans as we currently are .
all along it was thought to be either an act of God or perhaps long , slow climate change , and that really changed in 1980 , in this rocky out@@ crop near Gu@@ b@@ bio , where Walter Al@@ v@@ arez , trying to figure out what was the time difference between these white rocks , which held creatures of the Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous period , and the pink rocks above , which held Ter@@ ti@@ ary fossils .
so , there goes the ice caps , and there comes 240 feet of sea level rise .
( Laughter ) But I missed the hospital &apos;s ecosystem .
now , the question is , where &apos;s the sound made ?
we &apos;re using very short wavelengths .
because these visible cues , these behavioral cues , tell us something about an animal &apos;s emotional state .
she didn &apos;t want to come in at night . she didn &apos;t want to come in for food .
now , I &apos;ve lost both my parents .
and I have found it a genuine comfort , a solace , to know that we aren &apos;t the only beings on this earth who feel love and grief .

this is a really , really bad assumption .
when you have a relationship with someone , helping one another is actually a natural part of that relationship .
so when something is really important and you really need someone &apos;s help , make face time to make the request , or use your phone as a phone -- ( Laughter ) to ask for the help that you need .
the play is an odd sort of tragedy , lacking either the ab@@ rupt brutality or all-@@ consuming romance that characterize Shakespeare &apos;s other work in the genre .
from the us@@ ur@@ ping king &apos;s blazing contemplation of heaven and hell , to the prince &apos;s own c@@ ack@@ ling meditation on mortality , Shakespeare uses melancho@@ lic mono@@ logues to breathtaking effect .

well , you see , this pro@@ lapse was so delicate , I could practically see myself pulling it out of the nerve root canal before she entered the consultation room .
and you know what they claim the reason for this is ?

my family had moved from Fort Lee , New Jersey to California , from the snow to lots of heat , and gas lines .
and I was building a Stirling engine over on the la@@ the , and all the motorcycle guys said , &quot; You &apos;re building a b@@ ong , aren &apos;t you ? &quot;
and I said , &quot; No , it &apos;s a Stirling engine . &quot; but they didn &apos;t believe me .
we also discovered that efficiency doesn &apos;t matter so much if your energy source is free .
so you don &apos;t want to optimize for efficiency , you want to optimize for power per dollar .
what if you combine the petals and the engine in the center ?
we have AC and DC , get 12 volts DC , so that could be used for certain applications .
if you get it down below five years , then it &apos;s almost a no-brainer because the interest to own it -- someone else will finance it for you and you can just make money from day one .

I &apos;m a mu@@ le , and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every day , and sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly .
when I heard that story , it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too , and this idea already saved me once .
it saved me when I was in the middle of writing &quot; Eat , Pray , Love , &quot; and I fell into one of those sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster , the worst book ever written .

and this , I believe , is the single most powerful way we can reclaim foresight : by seeing ourselves as the good ancestors we long to be , ancestors not just to our own children but to all humanity .
and in order not to have the selection bias , to look only at geniuses , we ended up reconstructing the career of every single scientist from 1900 till today and finding for all scientists what was their personal best , whether they got the Nobel Prize or they never did , or no one knows what they did , even their personal best .
so we measured the productivity , and amazingly , the productivity , your likelihood of writing a paper in year one , 10 or 20 in your career , is indistinguishable from the likelihood of having the impact in that part of your career .

I &apos;ve had to take a real , honest look at the ways that I &apos;ve unconsciously been hurting the women in my life , and it &apos;s ugly .
and so , I thought perhaps incarcerated men and women -- who don &apos;t have access to nature , who often have a lot of time , they often have space , and you don &apos;t need any sharp tools to work with mosses -- would be great partners .
and so , I think for many reasons -- ecological , social , economic and perhaps even spiritual -- this has been a tremendous project and I &apos;m really looking forward to not only myself and my students doing it , but also to promote and teach other scientists how to do this .

the secret to biology is , it builds computation into the way it makes things . so this little thing here , poly@@ mer@@ ase , is essentially a supercomputer designed for replicating DNA .
so we &apos;ve got autonomous replication of bit strings .
and the whole point of going with the extremely simple rules here , and the incredibly simple state machines in the previous design , was that you don &apos;t need digital logic to do computation .
so , this sort of thinking about structure as computation and structure as information leads to other things , like this .

and although I think he certainly had the capacity for play -- because I do know something about that -- he wasn &apos;t as empowered , I think , as he now is by paying attention to what is his own passion and his own inner drive , which I think has its basis in all of us in our play history .

she finished her final year of high school at Mini@@ do@@ ka , and with the aid of an anti-@@ racist Qu@@ a@@ ker organization , she was able to enroll at Friends University in Kansas .
the danger of AI is not that it &apos;s going to rebel against us , it &apos;s that it &apos;s going to do exactly what we ask it to do .

how can we maintain an internet with freedom of expression at the core , while also ensuring that the content that &apos;s being disse@@ minated doesn &apos;t cause irre@@ parable harms to our democracies , our communities and to our physical and mental well-being ?
it &apos;s memes , videos , social posts .

( pr@@ erec@@ orded fishing cat sounds ) It &apos;s a cat that loves water , loves to fish , and lives in some of the most unique and valuable ecosystems on earth : the wetlands and mangrove forests of South and Southeast Asia .
but , &quot; How do we find our way back to it ? &quot;
and the months of isolation fostered fear and loneliness and frustration .
it &apos;s very hard to remember even what happened in that year .
and you could see how going into the subway station is like a journey through the pages of a sket@@ ch@@ book , and you can see sort of a diary of work writ across a public space , and you &apos;re turning the pages of 20 years of art work as you move through the subway .
how can a painting on string become a moment in Denmark , in the middle of a trek ?
am : so as an expert in national security and as a member of Congress , you &apos;ve been called upon to think about issues related to immigration , and in recent years , particularly about the border wall .
and then we also saw a decrease in the number of people that were leaving those areas to try to come to the United States illegally .
and so as you think about this and think about how we would redesign this system to not do what we &apos;re doing , which is years and years of detention and separ@@ ations and hardship for people seeking -- and again , asylum being a lawful United States government process -- for people seeking to enter our country law@@ fully .
it &apos;s not how many miles of f@@ encing that we have ultimately built .
in these environments , you have hot water dissolving minerals from the underlying rocks .
I was heartbroken at his death .
I felt like I had found my passion and my purpose in life .
perhaps if we had a chance to interact with wildlife , more of my classmates would be working alongside me now .
so what needs to be done ?
I &apos;m not plugging T-@@ Mobile .
but the thing that T-@@ Mobile did that nobody &apos;s done before is , when you &apos;re on a call an you move from Wi-Fi into cellular range , the call is handed off in mid-@@ sy@@ ll@@ able , seamlessly . I &apos;ll show you the advanced technologies we use at the New York Times to test this gear .
J@@ P : Oh , it sounds pretty good .
Google : say the business and the city and state .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : stay up here , David , I &apos;ve got a question for you .
CA : and there are many adults as well , literally millions around the world , and in some industries , they actually account for the fact that , for example , we don &apos;t see a lot of metal waste in the world .
see , all plastic is is building blocks from oil and gas .
CA : so that &apos;s the fundamental problem , the price of recycled plastic is usually more than the price of just buying it made fresh from more oil .
so I say , &quot; Right , I need you to make a contribution to an environmental and industry transition fund .
and the limit is , behind the visuals , the actual information being exchanged between players or entities in a single game world has been deeply bounded by the fact that games mostly take place on a single server or a single machine .
and to be at the point where we can start to experience those things that we can &apos;t yet fathom .
so , my plea to you is this .
he even built a massive C@@ it@@ a@@ del in case the French tried to invade again .
I thought about that for quite a spell , and I wanted to come up with my own definition .
I wanted them to be good inside too .
their names are Patri@@ ce and P@@ ate@@ e .
they &apos;re going to say , in regions of profound instability throughout the world , where you have intense poverty , where populations are growing and you don &apos;t have sustainable resources like this , this is going to lead to food insecurity .
Mr. Ailey believed that dance came from the people and needed to be delivered back to the people .
Alvin didn &apos;t need to explain to us what was going on at the time in the &apos; 60s and the &apos; 70s ; it was obvious why were doing his work .
he tapped into every emotion he had and we had , and from ang@@ er@@ ness to happiness , to grief and everything in between , he knew us .
and first of all , you have to go with me for a second , and say , you know , you could take the word &quot; love &quot; out of a lot of things in our society , put the word &quot; design &quot; in , and it still works , like this quote here , you know . it kind of works , you know ?
( Laughter ) They disappeared , quite honestly , and all I got was postcards .
and I &apos;m telling myself , &quot; This is going to be a great car , they &apos;re doing research that I &apos;ve never even thought about before . &quot;
they divided up the different subway lines and added their own version .
( Laughter ) So this is one .
he didn &apos;t want any of his friends to be arrested , so he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card .
and , for sure , I haven &apos;t looked at the sky in the same way after spending an hour in there .
a couple of weeks ago , a ( Laughter ) French company asked us to design five billboards for them .
she lived to a hundred , even then . all along it was the sadness , the squ@@ al@@ or , but I never , until now loved her again .
still life on a rooftop , dead trees in barrels , a bench broken , dogs , excre@@ ment , sky .
her whispering , &quot; Thanks love . &quot; lightly , lightly against me .
how much more she reveals in her gl@@ are of ink than she knows .
there are several scenarios for the future newspaper .
so what is the lesson behind it ?
from there with all the skills and knowledge from parag@@ li@@ ding and all the different disciplines in skydiving , I went on to B@@ AS@@ E jumping .

but , as I mentioned earlier , we don &apos;t know exactly what they are .
and we will get closer to reach our vision of saving lives with every line of code .
it &apos;s like looking for a needle in a haystack .
so why don &apos;t we just all take a nice deep breath in ...
so it &apos;s no surprise , then , that smell and body odor gets a bit of bad reputation .
now when we found and saw the results , it was really quite staggering .
in this study , then , what we did is we obviously gave the children treatment to clear the parasites , and then we tested them again , and what we found was that highly attractive trait that was there disappeared after they had cleared the infection .
or a recipe : if you get an ingredient wrong or you cook it too long or too little , it doesn &apos;t taste right .
so I &apos;m going to show you what this looks like .
( Laughter ) OK , so now what I &apos;m going to ask is if you can all just be a little bit quiet , not move around too much .
your brain only learns if we move .
and theoretically , knowledge of that information would allow us to recreate the object from its particle components .
those lines that are there today , those flags were created because somebody said , &quot; the Scot@@ ts are not like us , &quot; &quot; the Wel@@ sh are not like us , &quot; &quot; the Bas@@ ques are not like us , &quot; &quot; the northern Italians are not like us , &quot; &quot; the Muslims are not like us , &quot; the blacks , the whites , the Christians .
when you board an airplane , before kids , before first class , soldiers in uniform board .
there are lots of thing that the approach I take can predict , and there are some that it can &apos;t .
and everybody &apos;s best friend , Ah@@ ma@@ din@@ e@@ jad . how are things going for him ?
so it would be a good thing .
so Detroit has this -- open land , fertile soil , proximity to water , willing labor and a desperate demand for healthy , fresh food .
and with the help of friends and families and volunteers , they were able to take down the bulletproof glass , they were able to clean up the grounds and they transformed that building into a community kitchen , into a cafe , into a store@@ front .
they grow fruits , they grow vegetables , they grow flowers , they grow herbs in healthy soil , free of chemicals , pesticides , fertilizers , genetically modified products -- healthy food .
so recently , I surveyed the literature to look at the river health around the world .
and it uses sodium chl@@ oride salt as its key feed stack .
that story does allow for hope for the future .
imagine the whole West African Ebola outbreak -- about two-and-a-half years ; you condense all the people that died in that outbreak into just a single year .
it couldn &apos;t sit still .
and from genome sequences that we got from the viruses in those cow brains , I was able to work out that this is a virus that spreads between 10 and 20 miles each year .
all you have to do is sme@@ ar it on one and let the bats &apos; habit of grooming each other take care of the rest of the work for you .
now we have a whole laundry list of questions .
her only way of recovering her honor is to hide the crime , believe she was married against her will , or deny the events out of shame and fear of being rejected .
I know all too well the pain of being rejected by my Moroc@@ can community in Belgium , and I did not want this to happen to the Yazid@@ i community .
changing someone &apos;s mind with information is hard enough .
we don &apos;t always do what &apos;s in our own long-term best interests .
but it &apos;s far more influential when it &apos;s paired with psychology .
financial incentives can help , but we shouldn &apos;t expect money in health care to do all of the heavy lifting .
depending on what they emphasize or minimize , what they leave in , what they leave out , what they see and want me to see , they tell their stories in a particular way .
many of our stories are about feeling trapped , right ?
that &apos;s why , when I see people who are depressed , I sometimes say , &quot; You are not the best person to talk to you about you right now , &quot; because depression distor@@ ts our stories in a very particular way .
and then , go write your masterpiece .
A@@ Y@@ G@@ TK : something must change .
so they have very few genes and genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out .
the question we had is : how could they do anything at all ?
and it opens and closes the shutter so the amount of light coming out of the bottom , which is made by the bacterium , exactly matches how much light hits the squid &apos;s back , so the squid doesn &apos;t make a shadow .
anywhere on your body , it looks pretty much like this .
so we took this strategy and applied it to Rajasthan .
but there was still a long distance to go .
while today &apos;s fastest supercomputer couldn &apos;t find those factors in the life age of the universe , a quantum computer could easily fac@@ tor@@ ize numbers way , way bigger than that one .
but we might not be safe for long .
now , unlike those two- and three-dimensional geometric problems that we used to have to try to solve with pen and graph paper in high school , most of these problems are defined in well over 500 dimensions .
Hi .
they have to return the letter . &quot;
what do you think happened ?
they were on even footing . right ?
some people , we sent a text message as if it came from their kids .
now , think to yourself : which one of those methods do you think worked the best ?
Thank you very much .
efficiency also bites back with false positives .
too often , they &apos;re crying wolf .
so precious time is required to eliminate mi@@ si@@ denti@@ fication .
yes , hardware is hard .
it was efficient until it wasn &apos;t .
we also need skilled operators to come to the rescue and that means constant training .
we can even build functioning synthetic circuits out of DNA .
they have set off down the different paths that form all the structures and organs of your adult body .
you want to prevent bugs .
so let &apos;s say you &apos;ve been busy in the lab and you &apos;ve been measuring your genes and you &apos;ve found that if Gene A is active , then Gene B or Gene C seems to be active .
and if we can realize this , we would enter in the era of an operating system that runs living software .
when he identified ships approaching the coast , he hur@@ led massive b@@ oul@@ ders into their path .
that initial rejection taught me that conservation is , at its core , a journey in listening deeply , to understand the pressures and realities that communities face through their dependence on nature .
so that &apos;s a very handsome return .
just to illustrate what to do about the nu@@ b of the problem , namely , light vehicles , here are four ultra-@@ light carbon-@@ composite concept cars with low drag , and all but the one at the upper left have hybrid drive .
now , when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil , including buildings , industry , feed@@ stocks and so on , you find that of the 28 million barrels a day the government says we will need in 2025 , well , about eight of that can be removed by efficiency by then , with another seven still being saved as the vehicle stocks turn over , at an average cost of only 12 bucks a barrel , instead of 26 for buying the oil .
and then another six can be made robu@@ stly , competi@@ tively , from cellul@@ os@@ ic ethanol and a little bio-@@ diesel , without interfering at all with the water or land needs of crop production .
they would have been gone if we &apos;d kept that up one more year .
and I &apos;m not an expert on sa@@ dom@@ as@@ och@@ ism .
but then I read in &quot; Dear Abby &quot; that that was rude .
and then coming to this conference , I realized that most everybody here shared those same qualities because really what trickster is is an agent of change .
why are modern buildings and cities full of these bo@@ xy shapes ?
you know , competing for density , competing for more space , competing for efficiency .
and the idea was to build a tower , high-rise , residential tower , but not a box .
the reason why I speak to you is because the world should know that we are here .
before it is deleted , it is often already too late .
( music ) In this world , there is really an evil who exists .
you can find this on YouTube , the gentleman who &apos;s rec@@ umb@@ ent on a motorcycle while text messaging .
( Laughter ) Our reality right now is less interesting than the story we &apos;re going to tell about it later .
now , how does this work ?
it &apos;s just plain hard to do .
which of the two is going to have more structural integrity when the two-year-old comes ripping through the living room , trying to play God@@ z@@ illa and knock everything down ?
assimil@@ ation was a compliment to genocide .
today , some schools teach Cor@@ nish .
and whether they &apos;re J@@ è@@ r@@ ri@@ ais speakers from the Channel Is@@ les , or Kenyan sign language speakers from Nairobi , all communities working to preserve or reclaim a language have one thing in common : media , so their language can be shared and taught .
and while your language may not be as widely supported , I encourage you to investigate , because chances are , someone , somewhere , has started getting it online .
we then decided to scale it up .
and pick the two best places -- the one where you didn &apos;t need any range extension .
you don &apos;t notice it , but when the aggregate comes up you &apos;re dead . alright ?
you know what happens at that point ?
cars and trucks add up to about 25 percent of the world &apos;s CO2 emissions .
200 years ago , in Parliament , in Great Britain , there was a long argument over economy versus morality .
I &apos;ll give you examples .
so green would indicate a healthy range , and red would indicate a problem that needs something done about it .
she also skipped out on some doctor appointments for a variety of reasons , but one of them was she wasn &apos;t doing better and she didn &apos;t want to make her doctor mad , so she just didn &apos;t go .
I think that Shakespeare really put it very nicely .
it &apos;s a little bit reminiscent of 1969 when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon , and everybody was about to race out toward the stars .
and this is very critical stuff .
they are going to think about it as this glorious instant when we laid down the very foundations of their lives , of their society , of their future .
and it was hyper@@ diversity . these are tropical rainforests .
there &apos;s no trade favors .
but the trade system , it provides us with a benchmark to study what an economy looks like when it &apos;s been shaped by natural selection for hundreds of millions of years in the absence of morality , when strategies are just based on the gathering and processing of information , un@@ contaminated by cognition : no jealousy , no spite , but no hope , no joy .
but the challenges of inequality are not unique to the human world .
so what you &apos;re looking at right now is a living fungal network with the cellular contents moving across it .
we &apos;re increasingly reliant on computer algorithms to make us profitable trades in spl@@ it-@@ second time scales .
what would happen if we compare and compete the trading strategies of these two ?
imagine if a team of surgeons could fly into the brain , as though it was a world , and see tissues as landscapes , and hear blood density levels as music .
higher density levels mean more activity in that point of the brain .
our researchers are interacting with this data by injecting bacterial code , which are computer programs , that allow these creatures to grow over time .
we &apos;re flying through 2,000 lat@@ tice of atoms -- oxygen , hydrogen and zinc .
we &apos;re going to actually move even further down as we go from this lat@@ tice of atoms to one single hydrogen atom .
this is actually a light emit@@ ter .
one of the brothers , Deminan , looked different from the others .
from im@@ memorial time , my people live in the Ya@@ wan@@ aw@@ á territory .
who remembers this infamous Styrofoam container ?
well I set up Temple with our suppliers to set up standards and guidelines .
at age 31 -- that &apos;s my age now -- in August I took two weeks to re-@@ examine swimming , and question all the of the obvious aspects of swimming .
first principles , this is very important .
( Laughter ) And proceeded to look at -- I wanted to set competition so I &apos;d have a deadline -- Parkinson &apos;s Law , the perceived complexity of a task will expand to fill the time you al@@ lot it .
and then from that point on , you &apos;re basically falling .
they think about how to get the weight over their feet because it &apos;s sort of natural -- they carry you all day long .
so I said yes to this proposition .
but not until 1997 did mathematicians actually understand how they could model it .
but you get too many stitches on the needle . so she quickly realized crochet was the better thing .
some of the best mathematicians spent hundreds of years trying to prove that this structure was impossible .
you all have a sense of what a flat space is , Euclidean space is .
and what they do is , they do it through the concept of parallel lines .
mathematicians for several hundred years had to really struggle with this .
but we found that when we devi@@ ated from the specific set@@ ness of the mathematical code that underlies it -- the simple algorithm crochet three , increase one -- when we devi@@ ated from that and made embelli@@ shments to the code , the models immediately started to look more natural .
we have these technologies . we use them .
why ?
and that potentially gives nativi@@ st approaches resonance far beyond those who consider themselves anti-@@ immigrant , and remarkably , even among some who consider themselves pro-@@ immigrant .
with this new map in mind , we can turn to a set of tough , new , urgently needed questions , radically different from the ones we &apos;ve asked before -- questions that might change the borders of the immigration debate .
when you win a medal or set a world record , this mirror shows the happiness that you and your loved ones feel , but also reflects the tears that you shed all by yourself , alone in the water .
you may share your external space with many others , but there is one constant companion that you all have : you .
so I had to give up the approach of drawing the fantasy shapes and convert it to technical drawings -- the shape of the wing , the shape of the fus@@ el@@ age and so on -- and build an airplane over these drawings that I knew followed some of the principles of flying .
but not office chairs .
only this time , instead of the product being shaped by the wind , it was shaped by the human body .
and the loose ideas had something to do with what I knew happened with people in the office , at the work place -- people who worked , and used task seating , a great many of them sitting in front of a computer all day long .
one is : you can &apos;t accommodate everybody .
they begin to fall off the end of your chart .
while reg@@ aling you with daring stories from her youth , it might be hard to believe your grandmother used to be a tr@@ ape@@ ze artist .
my favorite part about living up there was the flying .
he lost badly but every Democrat does .
and there are a couple of these that have strong predictive relationships , one of which is education , where you see the states with the fe@@ west years of schooling per adult are in red , and you see this part of the country , the kind of Appalachi@@ ans region , is less educated . it &apos;s just a fact .
in 2000 they had particularly interesting questions about racial attitudes .
and likewise they asked , not in 2000 , but in the same survey in 1996 , &quot; Would you not vote for a qualified black president ? &quot;
as the audience approaches the facade of the building , they see a 30-@@ foot billboard .
if you go to any beach around the Northeast or Western Coast , you &apos;ll see that they use dre@@ dging year after year after year just to survive .
and we recognize that need for police officers who &apos;ve witnessed a gruesome crime scene and nurses who have lost a patient .
my interactions with colleagues and my own experiences make me feel like this is a universal struggle across all grade levels .
I wanted to be followed by a devoted team , I wanted to be right .
it &apos;s not only ineffective , it &apos;s dangerous , because it leads us to believe that it &apos;s been solved by that hero , and we have no role .
until 2014 , there was no protection for these workers .
first of all , language went back to Chinese .
my dream is that one day , someone will stand on this stage and tell you how radical interdependence saved my beloved rhinos .
through biofabri@@ cation , I had replaced many intensive man-made steps with one biological step .
to illustrate that , let &apos;s go back to Singapore .
you can &apos;t understand what is actually happening .
and it &apos;s a community around it that has decided to build this .
and this is very important , because virgin plastic is made from fossil fuels that are an exhaustible resource .
for us , to make a sha@@ mp@@ oo bottle from discarded plastics , we had to collect tens of thousands of tons of discarded plastics .
no developed country or city in the entire world has the luxury of such a brilliant collection system .
we started trading with the informal recyclers , we started training them to segre@@ gate the materials based on our quality specifications .
( Applause ) SRK : Thank you , Man@@ i .
the premise was simple : I would lead , and it would follow .
but in doing the work , I realized a little bit more about how the architecture of an AI is constructed .
she &apos;s saving lives . you work at a bank . &apos; &quot; ( Laughter ) And there you had it .
so what was going on in September of 2017 ?
but really , they were asking me a fundamental question : &quot; am I safe ? &quot;
right now , in this democracy , in the United States , one person gets to decide whether or not to launch a nuclear strike .
Wow .
after all , this is &quot; national security . &quot;
I get essential resources into the hands of people and visionaries on the front lines , doing work that matters .
are you super involved in the alumni network ?
so , he couldn &apos;t understand what I was trying to say to him , that I finally , in an act of sheer desperation , was like ...
one , it gives the donor an easy way out .
not kidding .
now , I &apos;ve talked about cheaper sensors .
and then , we &apos;ve shared that information with consumers in a way that gives them a choice and lets them make consumption decisions that are more in line with their values .
then we went into the laboratory and produced these peptides .
it seems that we need microbes to be programmed for good health , but not just any microbes , we need the right combination .
so let &apos;s figure this out .
now , this string of amino acids , this necklace , folds up into a higher-@@ order structure .
we can find an enzyme that has some starting activity , some clay that we can work with .
so let me get this in here .
and in addition to tinkering with natural enzymes , like we &apos;ve been talking about , some scientists are now trying to design enzymes from scratch , using machine learning , an approach from artificial intelligence , to inform their enzyme designs .
so for me , impostor syndrome is a feeling of being well , well out of your depth , yet already entrenched in the situation .
so I spent a week trying to learn everything I could about industrial-@@ scale batteries and the electricity grid and renewables and the economics of all of this and whether this was even a feasible proposal .
but when I first visited in 2010 , I was horrified and completely confused as to why the beach was covered in trash .
so my view is : be optimistic .
and it &apos;s focusing on skill after skill , or ability after ability , under specific atten@@ tional control .
this is actually very powerful .
so here is a very simple experiment .
we see here a reconstruction of how the hand is represented in the brain .
it &apos;s all about cortical processing and fore@@ brain specialization .
the brain is recording all information and driving all change in temporal context .
such a child will have memory and cognitive deficits in this domain .
it means that most people who are at risk for sen@@ ility , more or less immediately , are now in a protected position .
but before you did the relevant physics how could you have known how it would turn out ?
talk about this .
so , the Ty@@ pe-@@ 2@@ a , we might call it that , is to think about some technology that incentivi@@ zes great powers to use their massive amounts of force to create destruction .
CA : your belief is , fundamentally , we are not going to be successful in just holding back .
NB : this also , I think , has only limited potential .
maybe by five or 10 percent .
but then what ?
but I don &apos;t mind .
I am a working mother , and I also go to school full-time .
you know , she was very ch@@ ic , but she was very filled with en@@ nu@@ i , you know .
yes , I took German for three years , &#91; German &#93; , and it was quite the experience because I was the only black girl in the class , even in the UN school .
it was this close on the sky to Le Ver@@ rier &apos;s predicted location .
these icy bodies are pushed and pulled by the gravitational fields of the planets in entirely predictable ways .
imagine now many different people , all walking in different directions across the plaza , but all looking 45 degrees to the direction that they &apos;re moving .
so this brings us to today .
we &apos;ve done massive su@@ ites of computer simulations , massive months of analytic calculations and here &apos;s what I can tell you so far .
so I would say , get ready .
I invite other journalists , writers , producers , pod@@ casters and poets , and they teach writing , communication and storytelling skills to our participants .
and before she was born , her parents immigr@@ ated from Bangladesh to the United States .
each child inherited the original &apos;s unknown serial number within its furnace , and had a random , unique serial number of its own inscribed on its shell .
which do you think is more likely : that Lucy is a portrait artist , or that Lucy is a portrait artist who also plays poker ?
Juana &apos;s maternal grandparents were born in Spain , making them members of Mexico &apos;s most este@@ emed class .
she accru@@ ed a massive library , and was visited by many prominent scholars .
today , S@@ or Juana has been recognized as the first feminist in the Americas .
however , huge supercomputer analyses , done of the likely effectiveness of this , show that it won &apos;t buy us much time at all .
half the states would run out of hospital beds in the first week , maybe two weeks .
well how good a city council you have , how good a mayor you have -- that &apos;s who &apos;s going to be in charge .
Germany did that when H5N1 appeared in Germany last year , in order to minimize the spread between households by household cats , dogs and so on .
we have no uniform policies regarding quarantine across the United States .
in some cases all schools , all churches , all public venues were closed .
if you expand that out to think of a whole community , or all your employees in your company , you begin to realize how limited the Tamiflu option might be .
but can you sustain your company that way ?
you could do it to your own kid . it changes color .
is that likely , do you think , here ?
audience member : one of the things I &apos;ve heard is that the real death cause when you get a flu is the associated pneumonia , and that a pneumonia vaccine may offer you 50 percent better chance of survival .
and I knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of the community-@@ led revit@@ alization of the new South Bronx .
hunts Point was formerly a walk@@ -to-@@ work community , but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to .
developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned : the developers , government and the community where these projects go up .
we have nothing to lose and everything to gain .
and if humans are kept out of the room , there comes the al@@ go@@ cratic nightmare .
and the problem is , some prospects were called by the commercial team while they did not know yet they would have to go to hospital very soon .
we are the ones who have said over and over again that when women are educated , when they &apos;re employed and they earn incomes , they will be equal , empowered and free .
a woman &apos;s sexuality is suppressed .
what would that tell us ?
why should a conflict like Iraq have this as its fundamental signature ?
why should there be order in war ?
what does it look like ?
alpha is the structure . it &apos;s got a stable state at 2.5 .
shouldn &apos;t life in the fast lane feel a little more fun and a little less anxious ?
that &apos;s New York down there in the lower right , and it &apos;s a band of light all the way up through Washington DC .
all of this other light that we can &apos;t see , this invisible light , also has a pollution problem .
I &apos;m not sure about kitchen appliances .
now , what happens if you don &apos;t have dark matter ?
if those dark matter particles are moving really fast , then the gravity in small clumps is not strong enough to slow those fast particles down .
and when I think about it , I &apos;m really worried .
and then we have this tendency , the career counselors and various people say things like , &quot; Ar@@ tists are not analytical .
they came to D@@ art@@ mouth College , where I was teaching .
it weighs about a ton or over a ton .
here the legs are re@@ trac@@ ting .
the permanent ice is marked in red .
this is a problem because the warming heats up the frozen ground around the Arctic Ocean , where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which , when it th@@ a@@ ws , is turned into methane by microbes .
compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cross this tipping point .
even though I had severe social anxiety , in that conversation , I was totally at ease .
a depressed person can ask for extra syrup in their pump@@ kin spice latte without explaining that they need it because they &apos;re trapped in the infinite darkness of their soul and they &apos;ve lost all hope of escape -- ( Laughter ) again .
you might fear seeing your shadow .
so I let my friend know I cared , and I didn &apos;t take it personally .
( Laughter ) We can be sad and OK at the same time .
I have a friend who , a while back , when I was having a depressive episode , reached out and said , &quot; Hey , I want to check in with you .
I &apos;m an astrophysicist , and as such , it is my responsibility to trace the cosmic history of every single one of your atoms .
there are more atoms in our bodies than stars in the universe .
and I should know this , because I am indeed a certified stellar mor@@ tician .
I &apos;m about to show you one of those simulations .
marijuana contains two main active compounds , te@@ tra@@ hydro@@ cannabin@@ ol or THC , and cannab@@ idi@@ ol , or CB@@ D .
at any age , as with many other drugs , the brain and body become less sensitive to marijuana after repeated uses , meaning it takes more to achieve the same effects .
he gets a message -- call it the message of life -- which reas@@ sures him that this medicine is not one of the 12 percent of all medicines in Egypt that are counterfe@@ its .
I want to assure you , the reason why you have not heard of these ideas is exactly the point I made in the beginning .
( Applause )
so , that &apos;s why don &apos;t freak out when I tell you that every year I can &apos;t wait to start doing my tax declaration .
in most countries , people don &apos;t trust their governments .
and the governments don &apos;t trust them back .
( Laughter ) That was a long weekend .
( Laughter ) Now , when we started that club night , I could not DJ .
it &apos;s because these deeper connections haven &apos;t been made .
nourishing friendships as an adult is work .
you need to be open , you need to be honest .
the player has to actually walk through his school and experience , really feel the harm , that the brother had been through , because for a long time , nobody really listens to him .
during World War I , one of the horrors of trench warfare was a poisonous yellow cloud called mustard gas .
one is a supermarket standard : white bread , pre-@@ packaged , which I &apos;m told is called a Wonder@@ bread .
( Laughter ) I have two ten@@ tative male hands .
and never before have so many people been oblivious of that fact .
I would love to go back to Tus@@ c@@ any to this kind of traditional setting , ga@@ str@@ onomy , good food .
there are different ways in which we must use it -- for residential , for nature , for agriculture purposes .
he did not speak about rice , in India . he said , &quot; To those who have to go without two meals a day , God can only appear as bread . &quot;
the problem wasn &apos;t the work I did in my office .
and again , I couldn &apos;t go . but it &apos;s a fascinating group . they make balloon animals .
he connected with people who cared about this : non@@ professionals , people with passion .
because he &apos;s got an efficient enough factory .
well with that sort of advantage you can churn out a lot of cars .
( Laughter ) You know the pirate tribe is a fascinating one .
they connect people to one another .
when I was about 24 years old , Kate Sto@@ hr and myself started an organization to get architects and designers involved in humanitarian work , not only about responding to natural disasters , but involved in systemic issues .
so we decided to embrace an open-source model of business -- so that anyone , anywhere in the world , could start a local chapter , and they can get involved in local problems .
what it showed me is that there &apos;s a grassroots movement going on , of socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller , and that we have the opportunity -- not the responsibility , but the opportunity -- to really get involved in making change .
so it &apos;s really important that if we &apos;re designing and trying to create change , we build that change .
so this is about getting an economic engine , and then at night , it turns into a movie theater .
but , steady state doesn &apos;t mean that things are getting better , it &apos;s just that they have stopped getting worse .
well , it is more common with multiple partners , there is less condom use , and there is age-@@ disparate sex -- that is , older men tend to have sex with younger women .
so now you know .
but ad@@ oration , it turns out , is not love .
for so many years , I hated my father .
when pressed , it lets down the force field over the artifact for 10 seconds .
coincidentally , also in 2014 , I met Mand@@ ë Hol@@ ford , a marine bio@@ chemist , and Lind@@ say Port@@ no@@ y , an educational psychologist .
this was perfect for us , as we wanted to be in schools so that we could reach the most number of students possible , particularly students who have been underrepresented in science .
extended reality has the potential to change the trajectory of our children &apos;s lives and lead them to careers they never imagined by giving them the chance to see what they can be .
and these are just the committed people , the sunrise people , right ?
so this points to an important distinction : photography can enhance your experience if it &apos;s done intentionally .
on a trip to Alaska , I had the opportunity to photograph Alas@@ kan brown bears .
success would look like every state stops all new fossil fuel expansion , because if they keep drilling and fracking and mining , the problem will just get worse , so that no matter what we do with wind@@ mills and solar collectors and so forth , we &apos;ll never be able to catch up .
now in India &apos;s case I believe there are six ideas which are responsible for where it has come today .
and the fact that we have English is now becoming a huge strategic asset .
so the point is just that these technologies that we have are really measuring the wrong thing .
so , by the mid 20@@ 30s , we had invented these flexible probes that were capable of going around blood vessels , rather than through them .
( Laughter ) But really , the point is that this technology enabled us to begin studying neuroscience in individuals .
because , starting in the 20@@ 60s , with the ability to record the neural activity in the brains of patients with these different mental diseases , rather than defining the diseases on the basis of their symptoms , as we had at the beginning of the century , we started to define them on the basis of the actual pathology that we observed at the neural level .
and we know that it can do this at scale .
well in nature , these transformations are part of a complex network -- a continuous cycle that re@@ distributes energy .
fossil fuel usage is down 60 percent per unit of production , due to efficiencies in renewables .
we are , each and every one , a part of the web of life .
for you , it &apos;s your call .
lubri@@ cants are used to reduce friction and wear .
it starts when you &apos;re a kid , of course .
so the added challenge here is : how do you remove plaque when you have one bite ?
they needed to put a tube up the kid &apos;s nose .
OK .
humanity alone ?
we can create laws through which we grant legal personhood to water .
this particular type of ax@@ ol@@ ot@@ l , a very close relative , is known as an acho@@ que .
right ? it &apos;s impossible to overcome this sense that this is indeed longer .
I guess maybe if you &apos;re color@@ blind , I don &apos;t think you can see that .
you basically see two types of countries : countries on the right , that seem to be giving a lot ; and countries on the left that seem to giving very little , or much less .
when you walk into the DMV , the person who designed the form will have a huge influence on what you &apos;ll end up doing .
( Laughter ) For the other people , I added an ugly version of Tom .
( Laughter ) But there is a silver lining .
in Amy T@@ an &apos;s 1989 debut novel , &quot; The Joy L@@ uck Club , &quot; this gathering at the ma@@ hj@@ ong table is the point of departure for a series of interconnected vig@@ net@@ tes .
I am the recently retired head coach of the UCLA Women &apos;s Gy@@ m@@ nastics Team , a position that I held for 29 years .
so how do we do this ?
that was my time-@@ out , and I chose to change .
and we can do better .
another was the launch of our pop-up grocery stores .
when we think of how we &apos;ve allowed innovation and technology to change our lives , from how we communicate with each other to how we view our entertainment to how we even receive food , it &apos;s amazing that we haven &apos;t solved hunger yet .
I remember meeting with investors and pitching the idea , trying to raise funds for my business , and one of them said to me , in true seriousness , &quot; Hun@@ ger is already being solved , &quot; as if millions of people weren &apos;t going to go to bed hungry that very night , and as if there was nothing else to do .
but it would be an orgasm -- ( Laughter ) nonetheless .
anyway , these women sat in front of an X-ray device .
did not find any evidence of up@@ suck .
they use the upper half of the face ; the ears are very expressive .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Yes . exactly .
you &apos;d immediately ask again : &quot; where do you belong ? &quot;
this is the very thought that needs to be changed .
thanks a lot .
and I know what you &apos;re thinking : you &apos;re thinking , &quot; The poor girl up there , she thinks she &apos;s at a beauty pageant .
and when I went there and sat there , and met these people that were in the center of it , and sat with these characters , I met some surprising , very complex people .
the amazing complexity of people emerges .
it made me sick at my stomach .
it &apos;s about those unions who put down their tools and demanded freedom .
&quot; you should quit your international career . &quot;
( cheers and applause ) I did get married .
so I didn &apos;t say anything .
the descent alone to the canyon floor took a total of 10 hours and that was just day one of four riding .
and it &apos;s true that those who continue to smoke are smoking far fewer cigarettes per day than at any time in history .
well , that &apos;s true .
going back to the 1930s , it was with advertising that heavily featured imagery of doctors and other health care professionals sending messages of reassurance .
decades of smoking .
we can &apos;t stop that .
one is the phone bill , and one is the electric bill .
most the music on the radio be hit@@ tin &apos; about it , kic@@ kin &apos; about it , or ri@@ pp@@ in &apos; about it .
when I &apos;m in it and I feel it , I be shou@@ tin &apos; about it .
and we are much more confident now than we were two years ago that we might indeed have on this moon , under the south pole , an environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms .
some Greek philosophers , like the Sto@@ ics , thought everyone should follow Diogenes &quot; example .
and we &apos;ve only got three minutes , but we could talk about it for hours .
they were doing fine .
and it was very funny . I used four , five and six years old kids .
and this school , named after the U.K. &apos; s first female doctor , and the surrounding buildings named for Mexican artist Fri@@ da Kahlo , Mary Se@@ ac@@ ole , the Jamaican nurse known as the &quot; black Florence Nigh@@ ting@@ ale , &quot; and the English author , Emily Bron@@ te , honor women who fought sexism , racism and ignorance , to pursue their passions to feed their own souls .
and we need strong , smart , confident young women to stand up and take the re@@ ins .
when I was a teen , I had terrible periods .
so we are going to jump back over 200 million years to the Tri@@ assic period .
so , how do we know what dinosaur lungs were even like , since all that remains of a dinosaur generally is its fossilized skeleton ?
and we are going to be using birds as our model to reconstruct the lungs of dinosaurs .
Rasputin never ceased his scand@@ al@@ ous behavior , and they were skeptical of his so-called powers and thought he was corrup@@ ting the royal family .
it exists not only in southern England , but distributed around the world . I &apos;ll come to that .
I am pleased to unveil that our three billionth seed -- that &apos;s three thousand millionth seed -- is now stored .
we have thousands of collections that have been sent out all over the world : drought-@@ tolerant forest species sent to Pakistan and Egypt ; especially photosynthe@@ tic-@@ efficient plants come here to the United States ; sal@@ t-@@ tolerant pasture species sent to Australia ; the list goes on and on .
how much does it cost ?
and when something disrupts those processes , like a disease , the collection of volatile organic compounds in the breath may change , too .
in this dramatically expanded ideal of a liberal arts education where the continuum of thought and action is its life &apos;s blood , knowledge honed outside the academy becomes essential .
if the question of where to start seems overwhelming you are at the beginning , not the end of this adventure .
after centuries of war , the world &apos;s kingdoms have come to an agreement .
the incredible thing about this riddle is that you can reach the solution despite an almost complete lack of correct information .
for every kilogram of vegetables grown in this way , hundreds of liters of water is conserved compared to conventional farming methods .
and I started getting in further and further into the factories .
information technology grows in an exponential manner .
we have done already 100 exhibitions in the cities .

I am no historian , ladies and gentlemen .
&quot; love Ca@@ me to V@@ is@@ it Me . &quot;
the flux of its lava cleared all in its path .
so poetry came as a complete shock to me , ladies and gentlemen .
fear for the future leads to some rash decisions .
we did the line install over the summer .
we must change everything .
and with no one to compete with , they can set prices at whi@@ m .
you and I aren &apos;t invited to that party .
that &apos;s not the world I want to live in .
she established this tree@@ house sanctuary after the robots freed everyone from having to work .
it often helps to start with one case , and work towards the general .
this is a world-changing invention .
h@@ mmm ...
and I started to ask enough questions to try and track to the core of this pattern of values that was part of all of these stories .
the rules were drawn up by Wester@@ n-@@ educated men in 1953 .
large numbers of people around the planet are now using household assets -- their cars , their homes , themselves -- for Uber , for Airbnb .
you are all walking raw materials for those large data companies , but none of you are paid .
the world has constantly been going through the circle of wealth accumulation to wealth redistribution .
ask them why .
today , I get to go home and tell him , &apos; You definitely made a difference . &apos; &quot; what a gift .
now if the elephants got stung , perhaps they would remember that this tree was dangerous and they wouldn &apos;t come back to that same site .
and if we do that , I believe we have the capacity for magic .
it &apos;ll wake you up and tell you to get your tail to the emergency room when the thing goes off because , if you don &apos;t , you &apos;re in deep do@@ o-@@ doo .
we &apos;re wired for dangers that are immediate , that are physical , that are imminent , and so our body goes into an incredible reaction where endo@@ genous opioids come in .
if we were only governed by pleasure we would not survive .
in the 1950s , Ol@@ ds and Mil@@ ner put electrodes into the brain of a rat .
it wouldn &apos;t eat . it wouldn &apos;t sleep . it wouldn &apos;t have sex .
it &apos;s also cr@@ inkling the outer corner of the eye , the or@@ bic@@ ul@@ aris ocul@@ i .
so if you want to un@@ mask a true look of happiness , you will look for this expression .
&quot; do you think the less-@@ fortunate are having better sex ? &quot;
dense forests and tall mountains made over@@ land travel difficult , but long coast@@ lines and numerous rivers , lakes , and f@@ j@@ ords provided a viable alternative .
( Laughter ) Pi@@ gs are very friendly and noble , they can be a great ma@@ sco@@ t , they make good pets and they provide sustenance to us in the form of pork . &quot;
and we then published a cartoon that represented a historical moment in time .
man : so you &apos;re the first human being to officially emulate a gecko .
okay , there it goes .
it does an equilibrium glide . highly controlled .
this part of the city is often seen as slums , squat@@ ters , informal , and people living here are called illegal , informal , criminals , beneficiaries , supp@@ li@@ cants , etc .
do we want poor people to stop migrating in our cities ?
so should we force our choices on them , or should we broaden their choices ?
to help us understand that scale , it &apos;s like squeezing the population of Pittsburgh into the New York Central Park .
you know , in high-density areas , where there is no scope for individual toilets , like the public toilets that we have here .
and that &apos;s why women decided to come up with a separate squat@@ ting area for children .
well , soon a black cloud formed over my head and here I was , outwar@@ dly very successful , but in@@ wardly very depressed .
I literally was eating the same carbon over and over again .
not me , that was for sure .
in Biosphere 2 I totally understood that I had a huge impact on my biosphere , everyday , and it had an impact on me , very visc@@ erally , very literally .
and part of that is that we had to model very rapid circulation of CO2 and oxygen and water through this plant system .
and understand its interactions with the entire Earth .
long , fine fibers can wrap around one another better than shorter , less fine fibers , which means those long , fine fibers make stronger threads that hang together better as fabric .
( Laughter ) I scroll through -- ( Laughter ) I scroll through f@@ an-@@ made paintings of Harry , baby photos of him , paintings of baby photos of him .
because if all five-@@ or-@@ so thousand of you do this and really commit , we all get our first chance to hear that sound and to decide that it is not a crazy sound .
the semiconductor industry has been getting better and better at making tin@@ ier and tin@@ ier devices , so at this point they could put something like a million transistors into the size of a package that is occupied by , say , a single-celled param@@ eci@@ um .
it even kind of looks like a smartphone , only it &apos;s about 10,000 times smaller .
these OWI@@ Cs are so small , and we make them in such parallel fashion , that each OWI@@ C costs actually less than a penny .
yeah , so if you wanted to , you could inject yourself full of robots .
as far as I could tell , that is the coolest job in the world .
PM : and one cool part is , you &apos;re going to be able to participate in this revolution .
if you don &apos;t act now , you &apos;re going to face terrifying consequences .
I &apos;m scared , but this is happening . &quot;
Thank you .
and I want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories about that transformation .
and that means that every medium is right next door to every other medium .
the media was produced locally . it was produced by amateurs .
many pharmaceutical companies offer deworming medicines for free , so the E@@ ND Fund works with the right partners to coordinate their delivery .
part of the money the E@@ ND Fund needs will go directly toward delivering deworming treatments to communities that need it and part will go towards facil@@ itating the han@@ do@@ ver of programs to local ownership .
it &apos;s a way to save someone &apos;s life with a resource that &apos;s completely renewable .
now she emerges into the spring air to begin her reign .
as the days grow colder , the workers starve , and our queen reaches the end of her lifespan .
Lord Shiva - primordial destro@@ yer of evil , s@@ layer of demons , protector , and om@@ nis@@ cient observer of the universe - was testing his wife &apos;s patience .
that &apos;s me with the funny gloves .
there was a burning question though that would not leave me .
some of these new bacteria learned how to eat sunshine , producing oxygen , pulling in carbon from the air and destroying the iron food of other microbes by turning it into r@@ ust .
( Laughter ) So , we know all of this happened and so much more .
there &apos;s nothing that makes you feel more -- the blessing and the honor of working in a program like that -- than to know that something that horrible no longer exists .
this is us at the K@@ hy@@ ber Pass , and that &apos;s our bus .
it killed more people than all the wars in history .
day seven , they show the classic scars of smallpox um@@ bi@@ li@@ cation .
who took a little while taking action , because WHO will only receive a report from a government , because it &apos;s the United Nations .
and while I &apos;ve tried to make my images not too graphic , keep in mind that surgeons have a different relationship with blood than normal people do , because , after all , what a surgeon does to a patient , if it were done without consent , would be a fel@@ ony .
surgeons are the tail@@ ors , the plu@@ mbers , the carpen@@ ters -- some would say the but@@ chers -- of the medical world : cutting , reshaping , reforming , byp@@ assing , fixing .
and the problem is it gets time-consuming , and cu@@ mber@@ some .
the problem is , FO@@ BO induc@@ es such severe analysis paralysis that it can negatively impact both your personal and professional life .
so spending more than a few moments on FO@@ BO is a massive waste of energy .
and we may argue at times , but what we can always agree on is how to raise a human -- our human .
I will never be able to understand the trials and tribu@@ lations of breastfeeding , the work that it takes , the emotional , physical , psychological and emotional toll that carrying a human can have on the female body .
these kinds of cells need to go crawling around in our bodies in order to find invaders like pathogenic bacteria .
&quot; I ... I don &apos;t know what happened , but Su@@ mi doesn &apos;t have the Earth crystal . &quot; so who ate which crystal ?
you manage to get them all in the proper containment fields just as the crystals &quot; magic begins to manifest .
I was not one of those kids that knew exactly what they wanted to do when they were growing up .
then there &apos;s three things to do immediately .
one : do not -- I repeat -- do not burn bridges .
Walter Mis@@ ch@@ el , my colleague at Stanford , went back 14 years later , to try to discover what was different about those kids .
cost-benefit analysis .
you can be future-@@ oriented , setting goals .
but despite being mathematically identical , the results for the second question looked totally different .
even the study &apos;s top mathematicians were 45 % more likely to get the second question wrong when the correct answer challenged their political beliefs .
and then I went to lunch .
finally , in November I helped to launch a coalition called the Coalition Against Stal@@ kerware , made up of academics , people who are doing this sort of thing on the ground -- the practitioners of helping people to escape from intimate partner violence -- and anti@@ virus companies .
one is it &apos;s got to do economic reform , not fuss about the political constitution .
( Applause )
a month ago today I stood there : 90 degrees south , the top of the bottom of the world , the Geographic South Pole .
( Laughter ) Imagine , if you will , dragging a sled , as you just saw in that video clip , with 170 pounds of gear , in it everything you need to survive on your Antarctic trek .
so we would have a live website , that every single day of the 33 days , we would be blogging , telling stories of , you know , depleted ozone forcing us to cover our faces , or we will burn .
young people would ask the most amazing questions .
young people in northern Canada , kids in an elementary school , dragging sle@@ ds across the school@@ -@@ yard , pretending they were Richard , Ray and Kevin . amazing .
it &apos;s risk . it &apos;s reward . it &apos;s randomness .
even those mundane , hateful , plastic grocery bags can become a bridge stronger than anyone imagined .
G@@ ever Tul@@ ley : a rollercoaster built by seven@@ -year-olds .
and then there was &quot; sex chromosome , &quot; which they had been given because of the fact that we had started seeing that the X would go with the females , and the Y would often go with the males .
every single person on the planet has an X chromosome , but no one is going around like , &quot; This is the every@@ -@@ person chromosome . &quot;
you know the Soviet architecture of that building is the conservation .
create a space for an office , a space of sustainability that really works between that virtu@@ ality and yet can be realized as something real .
unexpected versus habitual .
if you wanted to make a film , you needed a mass of equipment and a Hollywood budget .
more anti-@@ retro@@ virals make sense .
most of you started out wanting to change the world , didn &apos;t you ?
you know , there &apos;s lots out there .
and with this one campaign as our umbrella , my organization , D@@ AT@@ A , and other groups , have been tapping into the energy and the enthusiasm that &apos;s out there from Hollywood into the heart@@ land of America .
it &apos;s not enough to create one .
and I really think that &apos;s where we are .
though nobody knew it at the time , these were the signs of a dangerous immune response unfolding inside his body .
combined with the new@@ ly-@@ discovered he@@ par@@ in , medics safely stored and preserved liters of blood , whe@@ eling it directly onto the battlefield to trans@@ fuse wounded soldiers .
( Laughter ) Yeah .
I am also deeply , fiercely proud of my colleagues .
a new drug reduces the risk of heart attacks by 40 % .
others were dying slowly with HIV and for@@ gave the perpetrators , who voluntarily infected them using HIV and rape as a weapon .
and this makes the difference .
I &apos;m pretty psyched about that .
but we &apos;re also trying to model you can actually release people back to their communities with effective court notifications .
we &apos;re going to have to shift our lens from a system that &apos;s about punishment and cruelty and isolation and cages to a lens of , &quot; What do you need , how can we support , where have we failed , how can we make that better , how can we restore and how can we heal ? &quot;
and what do I mean by that ?
the Pri@@ ority Dis@@ plays gave the astronauts a choice - to land or not to land .
I used to watch the stereo flash color when the music shifted , and I knew it was just a matter of time before my watch could show me sound , too .
my mother was exposed to German measles when she was pregnant with me .
but I &apos;ve never once wished to be hearing .
by 2001 , the procedure had evolved considerably , but it still wiped out any natural hearing that you had .
there are advantages to having bionic body parts as well .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m hearing when I need to be , and the rest of the time , I &apos;m not .
( Laughter ) With the cochlear implant , I can stream music from my iPod into my head without ear@@ buds .
but I see it differently .
I would much rather see that commercial .
changing how people think is like getting them to break a habit .
technology has come so far .
video : April 17th , 1975 .
I mean I could immediately tap into an immune response that was already there , where it was not going to take five or six days to develop it -- it was going to immediately attack whatever this thing was on .
( Applause )
well , what &apos;s going on is the villages of the world are emp@@ tying out .
the climate news , I &apos;m sorry to say , is going to keep getting worse than we think , faster than we think .
in the Whole Earth Catalog , my first words were , &quot; We are as Gods , and might as well get good at it . &quot;
if I stand in front of a mountain and I shout , the longer it takes for me to hear my echo back at me , the further away that mountain is .
as you know , it took over 40 years to get there , and it takes a signal traveling at the speed of light over 40 hours to get there and back again .
and designing and building a precision instrument that can support that is as much an art as it is a science and an engineering .
imagine having GPS on the Moon or Mars .
and that journey , that gives us data , data to build better models , better models of planetary atmospheres throughout our solar system .
in the studio we do a lot of experiments .
do you see when I said in the beginning , it &apos;s about why , rather than how ?
interestingly , those three phenomena are all connected .
for example : listening to very specific types of turbul@@ ences and non@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity of the voice can help predict very early stages of Parkinson &apos;s , just through a phone call .
so everyone has the same mechanism .
finally , we have a fourth filter .
this copy doesn &apos;t create any motion itself but instead is sent to other regions of the brain to inform them of the impending motion .
so let &apos;s recapit@@ ulate .
our visual field is packed with so much information that our perception has become a commodity with real estate value .
basically , any virus that &apos;s been sequenced today -- that genome can be made .
so even if somebody made the smallpox genome , that DNA itself would not cause infections .
and there &apos;s only two countries , the U.S. and the former Soviet Union , that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents .
the glass started to burn and crack , while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier .
&quot; defining moment in American history , I don &apos;t think there &apos;s one ; you can &apos;t say Hiroshima , that &apos;s a big one -- I can &apos;t think of any one moment I would say is a defining moment .
and so suddenly they &apos;re looking at me .
&quot; I began to learn how to cover it up , because I didn &apos;t want nobody to know that this was happening in my home .
he had a belt because he had this warped per@@ verted thing that M@@ ye@@ sha was having sex with her little brother and they was fon@@ d@@ ling each other -- that would be his reason .
he says , &apos; She won &apos;t breathe . &apos; I knew immediately that she was dead .
they fought for their rights for over two centuries , and maybe because they sacrifice other minorities , Hispanic , Asian , we would suffer more in the mainstream .
&quot; but I wish that , I wish that , I wish that I could be part of the enjoyment .

the other way around , mental walls can grow so strong that they encourage us to build , keep or strengthen physical walls .
and all of a sudden , children were drawing together , exchanging pencils and talking on the phone .
especially the phones were a great success , because they were so amazed by the fact that they can hear the other side through this device that they couldn &apos;t stop speaking .
we have to challenge our opinion and beliefs and maybe even admit our own wrongs .
but gradually , we are beginning to learn a lot , as we did with SARS .
so as we &apos;re adjusting to that , we need to at least try to understand what type of style of communication they use .
but if we stick to these steps and put in the work that comes with it , we can learn to avoid it .
this was done under local anesthesia , as an out@@ patient .
now she blamed this on my father &apos;s side , of course .
but the bad news is that your cousin is also Lizzie Bor@@ den .
this has tremendous implications for our understanding of the evolution of human skin pigmentation .
and what Darwin could not appreciate , or didn &apos;t perhaps want to appreciate at the time , is that there was a fundamental relationship between the intensity of ultraviolet radiation and skin pigmentation .
( Laughter ) Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as you may just smile .
and in the world , approximately one percent of the population is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder .
what we see unlocks the invisible ties and bonds of sympathy that bring us together to become a human community .
our responsibility is to let everyone have the chance to realize their potential to the full .
but I think what &apos;s new is that we now have the capacity to communicate instantaneously across frontiers right across the world .
then take Iran itself , and what people are doing today : following what happened to N@@ eda , people who are preventing the security services of Iran finding those people who are blogging out of Iran , any by everybody who is blogging , changing their address to Tehran , Iran , and making it difficult for the security services .
we should be marching towards a global society .
yeah , I did .
when we put all these pieces together , this ultimate explanation for near@@ sigh@@ tedness -- that environmental and behavioral change impact the way we use our eyes -- helps us better understand the proximate cause .
( Laughter ) ( Audience ) Woo@@ -@@ hoo !
I &apos;m an immigrant from Venezuela , and I &apos;ve lived in the US for six years .
so we turned to the experts actually living inside of the country .
with their expert advice , we came up with a series of challenges for hack@@ athon participants .
last year , Venezuela suffered what some people consider the worst power failures in Venezuelan history .
what is so great about this is that we are using our professional skills , so it comes easily and naturally .
so let &apos;s try by refra@@ ming how we view it .
about putting your mental , physical and emotional well-being in the rear view and the damage it has caused .
one of the reasons why we might be suffering is that we are surrounded by sno@@ bs .
we &apos;ve done away with the caste system , we are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please .
when you go to a large book@@ shop and look at the self-help sections , as I sometimes do -- if you analyze self-help books produced in the world today , there are basically two kinds .
everybody , all politicians on Left and Right , agree that meritocracy is a great thing , and we should all be trying to make our societies really , really meritocratic .
and even in school there are test scores and today with our salaries and job performance .
they were just small parts of my day and small parts of my average .
and so I did what I knew how . I went home , and I got busy .
they also tell us that if you want to have a full evaluation , determine if somebody has PTSD , you need to have a minimum of one hour interview with a mental health expert that &apos;s trained to detect what PTSD is to determine if you suffer from it .
and here we suddenly begin to have a mapping between curvature that we can exploit numerically , a relative mapping between curvature and shape .
so let &apos;s bring up a video of that .
there is just a little test screen that shows that it &apos;s working .
checking him out ...
what happened ?
and he desp@@ ised it from the bottom of his heart .
here you can &apos;t find anybody to compare it with , because we &apos;re the only animal that walks upright on two legs .
there is only one circumstance in which they always , all of them , walk on two legs , and that is when they are w@@ ading through water .
they say &quot; Well ...
no sign of that happening either .
they decided in 1960 , &quot; That belongs with the UFOs and the ye@@ tis . &quot;
so if you give just to one side or the other , you &apos;ll have tension or friction .
if you zoom in here , you can see North Korea , in outline here , which is like a black hole compared to its neighbors .
but , to get on a process of increasing income , increasing skills led to very rapid growth there .
let us have a Hong Kong nearby .
there is also lots of land in Africa where new cities could be built .
how would we finance this ?
now for the less basic parts .
if you look at COVID-19 right now , it seems like it could have a period where you &apos;re infected and show no symptoms that &apos;s as long as 24 days .
I led an evaluation of Ebola treatment centers in Sierra Leone , and the fact is that local doctors in Sierra Leone identified the Ebola crisis very quickly , first as a dangerous , contagious hemorrha@@ gic virus and then as Ebola itself .
COVID-19 has also revealed some real weaknesses in our global health supply chains .
wash your hands a lot .
if you think you have symptoms of COVID-19 , stay home , call your doctor for advice .
so thank you so much for listening to me today , and can I be the first one to tell you : wash your hands when you leave the theater .
that might be through working from home , from changing lifestyle and kind of where you go in crowded places and dinners .
it took much longer than sometimes we like to think in this story , but by 18@@ 66 , when the next big cholera outbreak came to London , the authorities had been convinced -- in part because of this story , in part because of this map -- that in fact the water was the problem .
and then I encouraged the ants to come &apos; round by putting sugar and things like that .
( Laughter ) And from there I was watching this little world .
so what I did , I got an o@@ il@@ stone . broke the edge of an o@@ il@@ stone off .
as you can see , there &apos;s an ap@@ hid fly there .
Michael P@@ rit@@ ch@@ ard : okay . we &apos;ve got some runoff from a sewage plant farm .
imagine that orch@@ est@@ ration .
and he thought to himself , &quot; They go from one density of medium , the air , into another density of medium , water , without a splash . look at this picture .
here &apos;s a wind turbine manufacturer that went to a whale .
and we are in a long , long line of organisms to come to this planet and ask ourselves , &quot; How can we live here gracefully over the long haul ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know what was the war for .
never give up . never give in .
yet as I wage this new war I &apos;m not alone in this drama .
and I said , &quot; No stop until we get it . &quot;
if anybody want to help us this is what we need .
if we can find a matching pattern in ar@@ ab@@ ic numer@@ als , we can still pick the right chest .
something that , in many ways , I wish no one would ever know , but here I feel kind of obliged to reveal .
now what would you do ?
that &apos;s not how it &apos;s supposed to work , right ?
okay ?
but once the task called for even rudimentary cognitive skill , a larger reward led to poorer performance .
let &apos;s go to Mad@@ ur@@ ai , India and test it . &quot;
autonomy : the urge to direct our own lives .
management is great .
there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does .
and if the demo gods are willing , in about 10 seconds or so we should see it .
we &apos;d like to know these things .
and that is what the Copenhagen Con@@ sen@@ sus is really trying to do -- to try to put prices on these issues .
and that is really why it becomes a bad project .
I find a lot of people find it very , very unlikely that we should do that .
and what I want to make sure of is , if we actually focus on problems , that we focus on the right ones .
the ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .
I see the Copenhagen Con@@ sen@@ sus as a process .
and I like that definition , because it enabled me to transfer their mindset into the dataset .
we have Liberia . we have Congo .
it &apos;s on par with United States in these two social dimensions .
let &apos;s see what Sweden has done .
1900 , Sweden was there .
but it &apos;s much more than Ebola that has been affected by this disease .
from here , the kingdom of death was laid out before him .
I love theater .
I wanted &quot; Up@@ wake &quot; to have the same audi@@ o@@ visual qualities as a movie would .
it &apos;s a human and technological revolution .
see , we used to have a lot of apples .
is agriculture adapted to that ?
it &apos;s not very exciting , but if you know what &apos;s there , it &apos;s pretty emotional .
it &apos;s one of the most significant threats to your property rights most people have never even heard of .
( Laughter ) Or my personal favorite : &quot; the United States of America v. One So@@ lid Gold Ob@@ ject in the For@@ m of a Roos@@ ter . &quot;
in that case , Carol Thomas lo@@ an@@ ed her car to her son .
it was just such a circumstance that compelled police officers in Philadelphia to seize an entire house .
since 1967 , Singapore &apos;s government has planted over 1.2 million trees , including those within 50-@@ meter tall vertical gardens called super@@ trees .
now , that was back in the day before the internet , when we used to have little books that we used to keep our information in .
my mistake is that I didn &apos;t stay involved or understand what was going on with our money .
now , most media companies , when they think about metadata , they think about subjects or formats .
first , reading glasses .
to solve this problem Benjamin Franklin invented what he called &quot; double spectac@@ les . &quot;
what it &apos;s telling us is that capitalism is going to become more social .
this unique set of gestures has been used for centuries , each movement rich with meaning and history .
however much suffering there is , they feel that , OK , if big brother says that this has to be done , then it must be done .
then bringing us into the present day is a fellow collaborator of mine and cymatics expert , John Stewart Reed .
he &apos;s kindly recreated for us the Ch@@ lad@@ ni experiment .
until , that is , I had to explain the entire place , and how it &apos;s supposed to work , to someone who had never been here before .
this is the beautiful , fragile drama of civilization .
we do mostly forget that these lines that connect the stars and those lines that divide the land live only in our heads .
I realized the things I could control were men@@ ial day-to-day things .
or , it plays down our own role .
and these particular woods are not far from London .
eighty years ago , that city was under attack .
those challenging , difficult , pessimistic meetings transformed as more and more people decided that this was our moment to dig in and determine that we would not drop the ball on our watch , and we would deliver the outcome that we knew was possible .
I can share this story with you , because it was widely reported in news outlets throughout the country .
more about that a bit later on .
there is no safety , no back support , no pads , no crash mats , no sand pits in the ground .
they were done for a photo shoot . one for the Sun newspaper , one for F@@ H@@ M magazine .
I drove the other one at 60 miles an hour , exactly the same speed , and clearly walked away from it .
we went to Cambridge University , the other university , and spoke to a Doctor of Mechanical Engineering there , a physicist who taught us that it had to be 37 miles an hour .
he didn &apos;t know if he would live or die . this is an extremely brave man .
but today , most outer sol@@ es are made with a synthetic blend of natural rubber and byproducts from coal and oil .
it &apos;s April 7th , 2020 , and obviously , we are in the throes of this crazy global pandemic caused by this new coronavirus .
PS : the whole idea of S@@ ent@@ inel is that we all stand guard over each other .
CA : Larry , in that talk , you showed a video clip that was a simulation of what a pandemic might look like .
I think throughout history , pretty much every pandemic is first viewed with denial and doubt .
we &apos;ve got great new technology for contact tracing , we &apos;ve got amazing scientists working at the speed of light to give us test kits and anti@@ virals and vaccines .
Bill Gates has said he &apos;s going to build seven vaccine production lines in the United States , and start preparing for production , not knowing what the end vaccine is going to be .
LB : you know , Tony F@@ au@@ ci is our guru in this , and he said 12 to 18 months .
one of the first large-scale imple@@ men@@ tations occurred in the United States during WW@@ I , when the military used an IQ test to sort recruits and screen them for officer training .
for example , as IQ tests were periodically recali@@ br@@ ated over the 20th century , new generations scored consistently higher on old tests than each previous generation .
in the case of Ci@@ pro , after just one day , we saw resistance .
so how does that work ?
and the great irony and tragedy of our time is that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still arguing about that .
we &apos;ve been talking about &quot; seeing is believing &quot; and seeing the unseen at TED Global .
now , local materials are something we deal with on Earth as well .
the problem with that distance is that it &apos;s a thousand times the distance of the Earth to the Moon , pretty far away , but there &apos;s no direct radio contact with , for example , the Curiosity rover .
what they do is they go and sit on a layer of re@@ go@@ lit@@ h and then microwave it together , and layer by layer create that dome structure .
there you go .
or they came across another robot , they had to be able to make decisions .
good &apos;s 4 year old daughter was imprisoned and eventually gave testimony against her mother .
what is its connection ? when was it last used in conversation ?
what has been my experience with it ?
the only difference is that we can pass on , through our words , our experience , our learning and our knowledge to the next generation .
so on hearing this title , &quot; &apos; K@@ uch K@@ uch H@@ ota Ha@@ i , &quot; I was shocked .
it &apos;s fucking freezing .
and for a swimmer , you need to feel your hands because you need to be able to grab the water and pull it through with you .
( Applause ) LP : Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
and I found myself wondering why I saw things so differently than many people in other parts of the country .
basically , I grew up in small-@@ town America , conservative at its heart .
it lets in ideas I already agree with .
well , the good news is that technology is changing , and it could change for the better .
JB : so I met John outside of Washington , DC , with an idealistic group of cross-@@ partisan bridge builders , and we wanted to re-@@ weave the fabric of our communities .
J@@ G : let &apos;s do this together .
F@@ an@@ fin ang@@ ler@@ fish live at about 3,000 feet below the surface in the pit@@ ch-@@ black waters , and the males are born without the ability to feed themselves .
and in the communities where we live , the places we work and the country in which we vote , we must take bold action on climate change now .
that &apos;s 58 billion dollars .
special people , special places , think up special ideas , then you have a pipeline that takes the ideas down to the waiting consumers , who are passive .
no , what you do , is you go in and you say , &quot; I &apos;ve got a fantastic idea for an incremental innovation to an existing product we sell through existing channels to existing users , and I can guarantee you get this much return out of it over the next three years . &quot;
there &apos;ll be huge professional arguments as well .
that &apos;s not their role ; they &apos;re supposed to read what we write .
I think novelists put this best .
now I &apos;m going to show you a three-year-old who got the same puzzle .
and we can see the continuation of this process of learning to think about other people &apos;s thoughts by u@@ pping the ante and asking children now , not for an action prediction , but for a moral judgment .
and so , what we can see is that over the course of childhood and even into adolescence , both the cognitive system , our mind &apos;s ability to think about other minds , and the brain system that supports it are continuing , slowly , to develop .
so that &apos;s good , but of course what we &apos;d rather is have a way to interfere with function in this brain region , and see if we could change people &apos;s moral judgment .
so it &apos;s not a sur@@ repti@@ tious technology .
I mean , what chances do you think there are that at some time in your career , someone , you or someone else , is going to come up with some paradigm shift in understanding what seems an impossible problem ?
RS : I hope they do . and I think they probably won &apos;t .
her patient is in labor !
two infect the lungs , and cause much more severe illnesses .
or as I like to call them , they are the mid@@ wives of capitalism .
and I came to think that behind the violence lay a sinister criminal enterprise .
I was there to visit my grandmother Alice .
family members , when they try to connect , most commonly will invoke a shared past .
but what if meaning@@ -making could be accessible to elders and their care partners wherever they lived ?
and what we &apos;d like to say with &quot; Yes is More &quot; is basically trying to question this idea that the architectural avan@@ t-@@ gar@@ de is almost always negatively defined , as who or what we are against .
so when we actually won the competition we had to do an exhibition in China explaining the project .
and they form this sort of vertical backyard where , on a nice summer day , you &apos;ll actually get introduced to all your neighbors in a vertical radius of 10 meters .
they are accessed through this diagonal elevator .
I became an inter@@ nist and committed my career to caring for those we often call the underserved , the vulnerable , like those neighbors I had when I first immigr@@ ated to America .
during my early training years in Harlem in the &apos; 80s , I saw a shocking increase in young men with HIV .
a health emergency even bigger than HIV / AIDS seems to be in the works , and it was my low-income patients that were dropping clues of what this would look like .
( Laughter ) Another thing we can &apos;t see is the human genome .
the point , most of us . what &apos;s the point ?
CA : tell me this , though -- because four days out of 14 , someone &apos;s going to say , &quot; Well , great idea , but that implies , like , a 70 percent loss of productivity in the economy , so that can &apos;t possibly work . &quot;
let &apos;s reset the clock to the moment the WHO declared the pandemic .
my past three decades of studying anxiety in children stems partly from my own search for self-@@ understanding .
I want you to think about it like this : your child comes into the house to you crying , in tears .
because skills develop with exposure over time , repeated exposure to everyday situations that kids encounter : self-@@ soo@@ thing skills or the ability to calm oneself down when upset ; problem-solving skills , including the ability to resolve conflicts with others ; delay of gratification , or the ability to keep your efforts going despite the fact that you have to wait over time to see what happens .
they wear bright colors , rose and blue , like Eastern dress . &quot;
and I then said to her , &quot; I think I know what you have . &quot;
about 10 percent of the hear@@ ing-@@ impaired people get musical hallucinations .
the things you see can be very complicated indeed .
but what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces , and as with Ros@@ alie , the faces were often deformed , with very large teeth or very large eyes .
the temporal lobe hallucinations are all sense hallucinations , full of feeling , full of familiarity , located in space and time , coherent , dramatic .
around 1970 , it was found that there were not only parts of the brain , but particular cells .
the mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this , but not terribly successfully .
when these were first described , it was thought that they could be interpreted like dreams .
he refuses the sacred cac@@ tus and sets off toward the mountains .
and that &apos;s where the deepest happiness has actually come from .
she did become a fin@@ alist ; she brought Mar@@ sha to New York .
I was beaten by my husband for five years . he almost murdered me .
she gave up her life ; she moved to Ju@@ arez .
and in the course of her travel -- she walked literally for eight years through the Rift Valley , through dust , through sleeping on the ground , because the Maasai are nomads , and she would have to find them , and they would move , and she would find them again -- she saved 1,500 girls from being cut .
when I was a little girl -- I grew up in a wealthy community ; it was an upper-@@ middle class white community , and it had all the tr@@ appings and the looks of a perfectly nice , wonderful , great life .
you might have had a French club or a Deb@@ ate club .
well , to move data around from one place to another -- again , it &apos;s not like a package cou@@ rier .
and it &apos;s no longer just a &quot; I don &apos;t know . I couldn &apos;t get there . I guess I &apos;ll move on , &quot; but suddenly a collective consciousness about what is blocked and censored where online .
so this is something you have to recognize .
and then on my second transatlantic , my ski@@ pper said to me , &quot; Can you navigate ? &quot;
this is me with my dad when I was a little boy .
if voters prefer A over B , and B over C , but prefer C over A , this method fails to select a winner .
this is a Bra@@ ille edition of Play@@ boy magazine .
he served seven years of a 70 year sentence in Kentucky .
our health care system relies on generics .
and on the other we have people who say the problem is that we need more aid .
it recognizes that the market has its limitation , and so patient capital also works with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy to include all people .
and it &apos;s where the idea of partnership becomes so important .
there are some galleries now and places you walk in , if you don &apos;t have 50,000 , there &apos;s nothing to talk about .
during some moment in your run , you &apos;ll enter that node , and then exit it .
that &apos;s probably more than at any time in centuries .
and they share a lengthy land border .
because in Min@@ e-@@ go@@ lia , Chinese firms operate and own most of the mines -- copper , zinc , gold -- and they truck the resources south and east into mainland China .
Iraq will still be the second largest oil producer in the world , behind Saudi Arabia .
I mentioned A@@ zer@@ bai@@ jan before .
of course , we can &apos;t forget Africa .
today he &apos;ll make his request to travel to the capital city of E@@ do for a year of martial and scholarly studies , and he needs their support , along with his father &apos;s .
but the practice doesn &apos;t just affect the da@@ im@@ yo - it determines much of the rhythm of life in Japan .
at the end of the lesson , he reminds the instructor of his request to go to E@@ do .
you can see it represented here in J.@@ M.@@ W. Tur@@ ner &apos;s painting , &quot; Rain , S@@ team and Spe@@ ed . &quot;
now , what Bru@@ nel said that he wanted to achieve for his passengers was the experience of floating across the countryside .
and to do that meant creating the fl@@ att@@ est gradients that had ever yet been made , which meant building long vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ ts across river valleys -- this is actually the vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ t across the Tha@@ mes at Ma@@ id@@ en@@ head -- and long tunnels such as the one at Box , in Wil@@ t@@ shire .
because with a few wonderful exceptions , very often when religious people come together , religious leaders come together , they &apos;re arguing about abstr@@ use doctrines or ut@@ tering a council of hatred or inve@@ igh@@ ing against homosexuality or something of that sort .
and also see that it demands acute intelligence , not just a goo@@ ey feeling .
and I am convinced .
( Applause )
it allows two people to virtually interact in a way that mimics how they would collaborate in person .
it &apos;s not very fun to do spectroscopy .
so for me 5,000 degrees is pretty cool .
this was considered as first evidence that actually black holes come from supernovae explosions .
so it &apos;s something which you can always refer to SETI and say , &quot; Well , somebody must be doing this , somehow . &quot;
and if I look at companies that are actually more successful than mine , 3@@ M since the 1930s is giving all their engineers 15 percent to pursue whatever they want .
we put a mask on it , looked at it deep down in the ground , checked it out from all sides , west , north , south , east , top and bottom .
and with the help of 100 volunteers , over a week , created this fairly fl@@ oral typography that spelled , &quot; Ob@@ sessions make my life worse and my work better . &quot;
and really , it &apos;s because everywhere we go , together or apart , we carry these mon@@ i@@ kers .
I grew up in a house full of photographs .
now , multi-touch sensing isn &apos;t completely new .
so , again , with a multi-@@ point interface , you can do a gesture like this -- so you can be able to tilt around like that -- ( Sur@@ pri@@ sed laughter ) It &apos;s not just simply relegated to a kind of 2D pan@@ ning and motion .
Thank you .
and that &apos;s going to pose an enormous problem .
we used to cook ; now we just add water , or a little bit of an egg if you &apos;re making a cake or something .
in fact , the date -- I &apos;m curious to know if any of you know what happened on this momentous date ?
but when we talked to people , it appeared that a funnel effect had happened in these tribes all across the United States .
now , this is the lowest of the stages .
and one doctor said to the others , &quot; Did you see my article in the New England Journal of Medicine ? &quot;
well , in fact , there are three somewhat counter-@@ intuitive findings that come out of all this .
they had people involved who were Nobel laureates in economics , who reported being bored .
never mind that I had no idea what ginger beer was .
after referring to the black Africans as &quot; beasts who have no houses , &quot; he writes , &quot; They are also people without heads , having their mouth and eyes in their breasts . &quot;
and most of all , a kind of normalized political fear invaded our lives .
shortly after he published my first novel , I went to a TV station in Lagos to do an interview , and a woman who worked there as a messenger came up to me and said , &quot; I really liked your novel . I didn &apos;t like the ending .
( Laughter ) And she went on to tell me what to write in the sequel .
( Laughter ) Can I have the lights up again ?
here you see four gray tiles on your left , seven gray tiles on the right .
now , are they getting it wrong ?
let &apos;s pull the covers off .
I &apos;m here for two reasons . these two guys are my two sons Ford and W@@ ren .
this guy built a bowling alley in his backyard , out of landsc@@ aping ti@@ mbers , astro@@ turf .
so , we would read in field guides , the standard field guides that maybe you have on your shelves , you know , what bea@@ vers need is , &quot; A slowly mean@@ dering stream with asp@@ en trees and al@@ ders and wil@@ lows , near the water . &quot; that &apos;s the best thing for a beaver .
so we just started making a list .
and rapidly we started to realize that bea@@ vers can be something that a bo@@ b@@ cat needs .
at five months old , she could not hold her head up like other babies , but she could hold this deep , intent eye contact .
here is one example . this is a train which goes from London to Paris .
which is that , actually , first one , all value is actually relative .
however , what we do have now is a much more vari@@ eg@@ ated media ecosystem in which to kind of create this kind of value , and it &apos;s much fairer .
if you had a large red button of this kind , on the wall of your home , and every time you pressed it , it saved 50 dollars for you , put 50 dollars into your pension , you would save a lot more .
man : just try both of them .
so , what we did was , for the past 15 years , was to dissect out the neocortex , systematically .
you realize that this poses a fundamental challenge to any theory of the brain , and especially to a theory that says that there is some reality that emerges out of this carpet , out of this particular carpet with a particular pattern .
and , in fact , the equations that make neurons into electrical generators were discovered by two Cambridge Nobel Laure@@ ates .
fly Emirates .
they have become frightened of being wrong .
or rather , we get educated out of it .
and he &apos;s right .
good evening , everyone .
in fact , we are losing species 1,000 times faster than the natural rate .
one is the rise toward communities and neighborhoods , and increased emphasis on your neighbors as your support system .
Microsoft is doing something wonderful .
they &apos;re digging in and looking for ways to extract value out of every purchase they make .
witness the fact that Americans are holding on to their cars longer than ever before : 9.@@ 4 years on average , in March .
you have to realize that you can &apos;t fight and control this .
and one of the reasons it is so difficult is that , unlike aliens and dinosaurs , we look at human faces every day .
but -- ( Laughter ) -- you could see that you could stop an orchestra with a finger .
( Laughter ) He &apos;s a nice guy . he &apos;s a really nice guy .
or he is actually transferring a very strong message to them , saying , &quot; Come on guys . you have to play by the book .
but of course it &apos;s not only about motivation and giving them a lot of physical energy .
( music ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m teaching her in that moment about intimacy .
it &apos;s what we can learn from our children and it &apos;s what we can in turn remind our children as they come of age .
and they are collected en mass -- you can see the scale of it here -- and sorted out , by hand , back into the right sizes , and then put back out on the street .
this is a stem cell that we &apos;ve developed here in Oxford , from an embryonic stem cell .
so the concerns , the xen@@ ophobic concerns of today , of migration , will be turned on their head , as we search for people to help us sort out our pen@@ sions and our economies in the future .
think how many discoveries they represent .
one &apos;s well-known : un@@ testable theories .
( Laughter ) That the truth consists of hard-to-@@ vary asser@@ tions about reality is the most important fact about the physical world .
so like Lawrence Le@@ ma@@ o@@ ana says , the power is ours .
( Applause ) So rather than buy into the ideas of Africa taking handouts , we are using our interdisciplinary approach to empower Africans to find their own solutions .
I &apos;m working with architect Neil Sp@@ iller at the B@@ art@@ lett School of Architecture , and we &apos;re collaborating with international scientists in order to generate these new materials from a bottom up approach .
so , Martin , he works with a system called the protocell .
and I remember yesterday , as I walked into the room where I was , I imagined the kind of cell that Manson would have been living in .
and we took him under our wing .
my home institution , I@@ fa@@ kara Health Institute , began in this valley in the 1950s to address priority health needs for the local communities .
it turns out we actually know very little .
but perhaps the fact that mosquitoes eat blood , human blood , is the reason they are the most dangerous animal on earth .
one : that society equ@@ ates living in a permanent structure , even a shack , with having value as a person .
( Laughter ) One of my senior colleagues told me , when I was a youngster in this profession , rather proudly , that statisticians were people who liked figures but didn &apos;t have the personality skills to become accountants .
so when her colleague said , &quot; What does he do ? &quot;
imagine this half of the audience each get out coins , and they toss them until they first see the pattern head-tail-tail .
it &apos;s very well documented that people get things wrong .
and he wrote to the ac@@ a@@ dem@@ icians in Paris , trying to explain his theory .
he wrote , &quot; The universe cannot be read until we have lear@@ n@@ t the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written .
and it was Galois who produced a language to be able to answer some of these questions .
and for Galois this was like the zer@@ oth symmetry .
what about the center of a triangle ? I can rotate by a third of a turn around the center of the triangle , and everything matches up .
and all the tiles match up again .
in order to win this symmetrical object , what you have to do is to answer the question I asked you at the beginning .
five or less digits . so , if you &apos;re in the tens of thousands you &apos;ve got to sit down .
( Laughter ) Let &apos;s have the other ones , who sat down during the 20 , up again . okay ?
so when I thought about compassion , my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips , where he &apos;s lying there and he says , &quot; I really understand , and I really appreciate how one should love one &apos;s neighbor as one love &apos;s oneself .
this , in a way , is one of the challenges of how to interpret a really good idea .
and yet , on the other hand , if I didn &apos;t feel this compassion , then I feel that it would be time for me to hang up my robe and give up being a rabbi .
and there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigue .
in Judaism , though , we tend to always say , there has to be a middle way .
if you put too much cold water in , it will shatter .
and , of course , in the modern world , with the environmental movement , we &apos;re becoming even more aware of the connectivity of things , that something I do here actually does matter in Africa , that if I use too much of my carbon allowan@@ ce , it seems to be that we are causing a great lack of rain in central and eastern Africa .
went on until a new rabbi came . rabbis always spoil things .
&quot; you mean God didn &apos;t want my bread ? &quot;
you can be compassionate occasionally , more moved by empathy than by compassion .
you are the very happiness , the wholeness that you want to be .
maybe the sw@@ ami is right . &quot; you start your new life .
if one has to blame oneself , one has a million reasons plus many .
but then , how to act compas@@ sionately if you don &apos;t have compassion ?
and so , I came to think that mama eternal , mama eternal , is always wondering : are all the children in ?
so , sitting on a flat@@ bed truck , the elders of the community are there , and Bobby stands up and says to the people , &quot; I have bad news for you .
one more picture while I &apos;m stin@@ king and thinking about the Riverside Church : 9 / 11 . last night at Cha@@ grin Fall , a newsp@@ aper@@ man and a television guy said , &quot; That evening , when a service was held at the Riverside Church , we carried it on our station in this city .
we were all suffering .
and he was dis@@ cont@@ ented with the state of people &apos;s practice of the Buddhist religion in India at that time .
and then I thought I would share with you what that method is , or one of them .
and also , actually , I &apos;ve been your mother .
and you begin to get very sentimental ; you cultivate senti@@ mentality intensely .
but &quot; kindness &quot; means &quot; universal responsibility . &quot;
biologists call that &quot; reciprocal altruism . &quot; OK .
it &apos;s not that people think that , when they feel the compassion .
but if you read in the newspaper that something really horrible happened to somebody you &apos;ve never heard of , you can probably live with that .
so , their fortunes add up to zero .
if your fortunes are interdependent with somebody , then you live in a non-zero-sum relationship with them .
if you want to reduce the number of people who are burning flags , it helps to understand what makes them do it .
assuming that a few of you did not do the assigned reading , very quickly , the key idea is the distinction between zero-sum games , in which correlations are inverse : always a winner and a loser .
I &apos;ve got to admit I feel silly saying that .
as a body of knowledge builds up , it will form one sub@@ section , or one sub-@@ sub@@ section , of an assessment like the IPCC , although we have others .
Thank you very much .
because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group .
but her tribe and family urged her not to compete and were very much against it .
so I thought , around last year -- in the beginning of the last year -- I started thinking , &quot; Why can I not take this approach in the reverse way ? &quot;
but recent advances in brain imaging technology have given neuro@@ linguists a glimpse into how specific aspects of language learning affect the bilingual brain .
if this is true , learning a language in childhood may give you a more holistic grasp of its social and emotional contexts .
be spectacular like Theseus , who entered the labyrinth and killed the bul@@ l-@@ headed Min@@ ot@@ aur .
and he wanted to ho@@ ist his flag to say , &quot; I was here first . &quot;
( Laughter ) Two different mytho@@ logies .
and I worked as a marketing guy , and a sales guy , and a knowledge guy , and a content guy , and a training guy .
and when you understand it you will discover something spectacular .
you and I , only two .
art can go through where other things can &apos;t .
from your beginnings in Africa , through each generation , may be passed on to you , in your creation . it &apos;s a secret urge , hiding deep in you .
we need to break down our vision of what planners are , of what the correct way of a path is .
he announced a S@@ way@@ am@@ var@@ a .
he &apos;s carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free , and that &apos;s how he gets orders from the neighborhood , to know where to collect clothes to get them ir@@ oned .
and this is happening more and more .
one simple fact : you couldn &apos;t try to call an Afghan at 8 : 30 in the evening .
crime went up at 8 : 30 . I have read a Reu@@ ters dispatch -- so this is not Indian propaganda , a British news agency -- about how rob@@ bers in the town of Mus@@ arr@@ i Shar@@ if * stripped a vehicle of its windshield wi@@ pers , its hu@@ b@@ caps , its side@@ view mirrors , any moving part they could find , at 8 : 30 , because the watch@@ men were busy watching the T.@@ V. rather than min@@ ding the store .
all of that is necessary , but we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome .
now , a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical worldview .
and turning around you is &quot; sh@@ hhhh@@ hh , &quot; like that .
we do not follow instructions . and so on .
and it was singing all day long . and when it stops it means that it just died .
and this is exactly the same at home .
Benki came back to his village full of ideas -- new technologies , new research , new ways of understanding what was going on .
even that wasn &apos;t enough .
the bright stars correspond to little d@@ ag@@ gers on the re@@ te .
and then finally , I take a rule , and move the rule to a date line which then tells me the time here .
( Applause )
( Laughter ) You see , I was a study nerd .
and on that axis I have life expectancy , the health of people .
Kerala is flying on top there , matching United States in health , but not in economy .
my friends at Gapminder wanted me to show this because there is a new leader in Washington who is really concerned about the health system .
get your book@@ ings in time . Thank you very much .
but I &apos;m always very interested to think about what might the stories be that the generations further down the slope from us are going to tell about us .
but as we &apos;ve seen over the last year , I think that &apos;s an idea that is increasingly coming into question .
energy and technology are not the same thing .
so basically , you have a group of people who are excited by the idea .
a lot of places are working with their local schools .
well , I &apos;ll quickly show you two options .
but , if I had something like a TED wish , it would be to actually get it built , to start building this habitable wall , this very , very long , but very narrow city in the desert , built into the du@@ ne@@ scape itself .
it &apos;s not only something that supports trees , but something that connects people and countries together .
( Laughter ) And we &apos;ve arrived at the age of interface matrices , where there are so many features and options , you have to do two dimensions , you know : a vertical and a horizontal .
( Applause ) Thank you -- yes , I designed the dialogue box . no , no .
and you know , there &apos;s a new version of Windows coming out this fall .
( Laughter ) You go up to the &quot; Fi@@ le &quot; menu and you choose &quot; New . &quot;
big medio@@ cr@@ ity in every way .
the crowd went wild , but I had just seen -- I &apos;m like , where have I seen this before ?
( Laughter ) But it turns out I was wrong , right ?
and I &apos;m sure every one of you has done this at some point in your lives , or one of your children .
not &quot; just . &quot;
and any nation that would become protec@@ tionist over the next few years would deprive itself of the chance of getting the benefits of growth in the world economy .
how do you persuade people that it is in their interest to build strong -- After the Second World War , we built institutions , the United Nations , the IMF , the World Bank , the World Trade Organization , the Marshall Plan .
but it &apos;s a kind of indirect argument .
and that is because of the atmosphere .
so , to give you a sense of what this is like , it &apos;s actually like looking at a pe@@ bble at the bottom of a stream .
looking at the pe@@ bble on the bottom of the stream , the stream is continuously moving and turbulent , and that makes it very difficult to see the pe@@ bble on the bottom of the stream .
so , I want to see how these things have moved .
that &apos;s kind of profound , in a way .
there is an abundance of young stars , so it &apos;s the exact opposite of the prediction .
sometimes our engineers and architects do not care about slopes in bathrooms , but here they will care properly .
last picture , it &apos;s a tattoo , 2,000-@@ year@@ s-@@ old tattoo .
I &apos;m talking to you about the worst form of human rights violation , the third-@@ largest organized crime , a $ 10 billion industry .
but that &apos;s not the only purpose that human beings are sold for .
I have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very well-@@ to-@@ do families , and children from well-@@ to-@@ do families , who are getting trafficked .
because what we did with these girls is to understand their potential .
I can &apos;t hear from my right ear .
now , that was my first puzzle . I got hooked .
&quot; fun to solve , &quot; as opposed to everyday problems , which , frankly , are not very well-designed puzzles .
you can create one out of Legos .
but I couldn &apos;t do that , I realized . I changed the problem .
this appears in my puzzle calendar .
well , guess what ? that &apos;s changing .
Emmanuel ? absolutely . ( Applause ) I was planning on finishing on a dance ...
( Laughter ) ( As Tony Blair ) : &quot; yeah , alright , come on , eh .
and everyone goes , &quot; Great ! &quot; he leaves the country and the French and the Germans go , &quot; No , no , forget about that , absolutely not . &quot; nothing happens . he goes to Str@@ as@@ burg .
sorry , what ? &quot; a nu@@ -@@ ca-@@ ler . &quot;
but he says , &quot; We want a nuc@@ lear@@ -free world . &quot;
( Laughter ) &quot; Tell a lie ; it was Diana Ross ... &quot;
they just need a space at a desk , and so we provide that at a fee , and others take up bigger spaces and are able to set up their offices .
the quality of the product isn &apos;t high .
and I thought really what we need is an elders program to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk .
all of those accidents that wound up creating the life narrative that we inherited .
this was not a devastating stroke , but it did affect his speaking and so forth .
and she said , &quot; Well , something very weird was happening .
and it had nothing to do with the energy of being young .
she stayed in her room .
she basically created the dances in &quot; Oklahoma , &quot; transforming the American theater .
I thought , this is somebody I &apos;ve got to get in this series .
and the audience just -- you know , they &apos;re always on the side of the inter@@ vie@@ wee , and they felt that this was a kind of assault , but this was the question she had wanted somebody to ask her whole life .
and we were helped by the market inefficiency .
and I say , &quot; That I got to write it . &quot;
and I meet a lot of people who are very successful , who say , &quot; Why don &apos;t I feel more fulfilled ?
and she goes , &quot; Well , I see Jesus , &quot; and started crying and left .
everybody &apos;s betting their life on something .
you &apos;re betting your life on something , you just better know why you &apos;re betting what you &apos;re betting on .
codi@@ fy it or qualify it or quantify it , and say , &quot; This is what I believe in . this is why I believe what I believe . &quot;
and it just sounds like the most e@@ goti@@ stical request you could make , if you were going to pray .
last year , I was invited to speak at the NBA Al@@ l-@@ St@@ ars game .
now , my second example is for a slightly younger crowd .
now , as many of you may remember , the Red Brigades was a terrorist , Mar@@ xi@@ st organization which was very active in Italy from the 1960s until the mid-@@ 1980s .
naturally , I didn &apos;t know that until the day she was arrested .
nobody wants the U.S. monetary authority to check their relationship , to monitor their relationship with their cli@@ en@@ te@@ le .
why did this happen ? this happened because the Patri@@ ot Act was a un@@ il@@ ateral legislation .
so , this is how incredible are the relationship between the world of crime and the world of terror , and our own life .
during the process of making these films I found myself taking photographs , often much to the annoy@@ ance of the video camer@@ am@@ en .
I felt , when I had my photographs , that I was holding on to something true , regardless of agendas or politics .
and this is something that is common to all our big cities .
in fact , someone on Reddit thought , &quot; What a great thing , we should all vote this up . &quot;
capital , Mal@@ é , where I live .
but if you &apos;re a marine biologist , Maldives is not such a bad place to be .
and typically , there is a lot of variation , but if you have a dragonfly with , say , a one year life cycle , which is quite typical , the larva , living in the fresh water , lives for 10 or 11 months .
this is , it seems a bit dull you know .
so , I &apos;ve been writing it down for 15 years now .
so , next thing I did is I got on the phone .
silence is sweet .
I guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right .
SM : well , actually the cost that we in@@ cur@@ red was less than 200 rupees .
they &apos;re going to put in six new nuclear power stations , and probably more after that .
we &apos;re going to have a problem with power in the next five years in this country .
and at each one of these stages , can be seen as a collision -- a collision with something else -- for example , a critical pri@@ ce-@@ line that changes both the technology and also changes its effect on the world . it &apos;s an inflection point .
that is , I imagine , what people in Red@@ mond wake up in the middle of the night thinking about .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And this is why you need weather@@ men .
if our airplane is too heavy , if the pilot wa@@ stes energy , we &apos;ll never make it through the night .
and this is possible . you know , with the technologies we have today , we can save between 30 and 50 percent of the energy of a country in Europe , and we can solve half of the rest with renewables .
well , why is that important ?
so , most of them will fire when I &apos;m touched in different locations . different neurons for different locations .
still has the tag in it from me buying it , so I can take it back to the shop if she didn &apos;t like it .
so , I &apos;ve taken it apart , component by component , months and months and months of work .
and in the northern part of the main island , this is ground zero for world longevity .
and , roughly translated , it means &quot; the reason for which you wake up in the morning . &quot;
so , if you hang out with unhealthy people , that &apos;s going to have a measurable impact over time .
and my mother , brave lady , was partly to blame , taking me to the New York Natural History Museum , buying me books on snakes , and then starting this infamous career of mine , which has cul@@ minated in of course , arriving in India 60 years ago , brought by my mother , D@@ oris Norden , and my step@@ father , R@@ ama Ch@@ att@@ op@@ ad@@ hy@@ aya .
this male snake , 12 feet long , met another male king cobra .
but we , actually , back in the early &apos; 70s , did surveys , and found that gharial were extremely rare .
and , sure enough , with all the other pressures on the river , like sand mining , for example , very , very heavy cultivation all the way down to the river &apos;s edge , not allowing the animals to breed anymore , we &apos;re looking at even more problems building up for the gharial , despite the early good intentions .
people scoop water out of the Cha@@ mb@@ al and drink it , something you wouldn &apos;t do in most north Indian rivers .
and it &apos;s a horribly painful death .
so I did a spot on CNN the other day where I actually spent more time in makeup than I did talking on air .
so they might curb traffic , or put in a park bench , or some green space .
I mean , you heard that I got a speeding ticket while I was researching my book on the benefits of slowness , and that &apos;s true , but that &apos;s not all of it .
I think there &apos;s a kind of metaphysical dimension -- that speed becomes a way of w@@ alling ourselves off from the bigger , deeper questions .
when will you include the child in the city ?
Ge@@ et S@@ eth@@ i : when a city gives to the children , in the future the children will give back to the city .
if not now , then when ?
the U.N. ran head@@ first into a problem that the majority of the world &apos;s populous faces : not having detailed maps .
this , of course , is a map of the moon .
Oh take the spiders too . I know they &apos;re not insects , but I don &apos;t care .
( Laughter ) Yeah , I &apos;m at the De@@ pres@@ si@@ o , and I want to get over to Amazon@@ is so I plug it into the Mars map , and click the button and there &apos;s my directions .
so beautiful that I will even give up a laugh to explain my love of this particular planet , and the day Saturday , named after it , wonderfully .
you gotta be accurate ! there &apos;s measurement involved , increments .
he was going to Harvard University .
I like to look sharp . &quot;
so I took the information I gathered over that past year , and I figured out that there were actually three categories that were affected across the board .
rather than designing my own collection , I knew if I was really going to make a difference , I had to go mainstream .
Vicky put an iron gate on her bedroom door and she became a prisoner , in fact , in her own house , out of fear for her nephew who had taken over her home as a drug den .
why is it that so much more video is not leading to more rights and more justice ?
( Applause )
and people simply do not have enough to survive .
this is one of my absolute favorite things anywhere .
( Laughter ) I had to drop 50 pounds in three months .
and I did a dive down to 160 feet , which is basically the height of a 16 story building , and as I was coming up , I bl@@ acked out underwater , which is really dangerous ; that &apos;s how you drown .
the other problem was the suit was so buoy@@ ant that they had to strap my feet in to keep me from floating up .
at minute 12 I started to have ringing in my ears , and I started to feel my arm going numb .
Mumb@@ ai@@ -based D@@ h@@ ru@@ vi A@@ char@@ ya builds on her love of comic books and street art to comment on the roles and expectations of modern Indian women .
medicine is doing a better job of keeping us alive .
so , your body is constantly re@@ generating .
hollow organs have a much higher degree of complexity , because you &apos;re asking these organs to act on demand .
and this is actually still , of course , experimental , not for use in patients .
and then you can see these miniature kidneys that we &apos;ve engineered .
we don &apos;t need to teach it to become another cell type .
and what I mean by that is that anytime we &apos;ve launched one of these technologies to the clinic , we &apos;ve made absolutely sure that we do everything we can in the laboratory before we ever launch these technologies to patients .
and when we launch these technologies to patients we want to make sure that we ask ourselves a very tough question .
my train was a heart attack .
and all of those black dots are all of the toxic release invent@@ ories that are monitored by the EPA .
and what did I know at that time about media systems ?
we do it in 17 countries of the developing world .
40 million dollars over 10 years spread over 17 countries .
that is not too much , is it ?
now take it to the last step .
this is the mod@@ us oper@@ and@@ i that we have today .
now this is a little bit of a dangerous metaphor , because of course we all know that inside of the Trojan Horse were a bunch of people with spears .
but there is also the potential to allow people to move directly from the outside , in this case suggesting kind of Wag@@ n@@ erian entrance , into the interior of the auditorium .
now , if you were to take a sco@@ re@@ board and drop it on dirt and whiskey , that would be bad .
here it is in an end stage configuration .

if you look in areas where these salts are completely available , the price is low or zero , these deaths still continue ab@@ ated .
so , here are these women . they &apos;ve seen their parents have struggled with diarrhea , they &apos;ve struggled with diarrhea , they &apos;ve seen lots of deaths . how do they answer this question ?
how is that possible ?
but it &apos;s more profound than fun .
fifty versus 35 , that &apos;s a big move . eleven versus nine ? come on .
this car , which is my Min@@ i , doesn &apos;t look that safe .
this is him on the screen .
here are the actual patients , there are 45,000 of them now , sharing their stories as data .
how they treat it , the drugs , the components of it , their side effects , all of it in a rich environment , and you can drill down and see the individuals .
( Laughter ) We hired them , set them up , assi@@ sting at lab .
when we look to the past , it &apos;s easy to see that emotions have changed , sometimes very dramatically , in response to new cultural expectations and religious beliefs , new ideas about gender , ethnicity and age , even in response to new political and economic ideologies .
it &apos;s so powerful , that it might have killed him .
this species lives only in the Congo .
but I don &apos;t think that we were that way initially .
maybe it &apos;s something special in his brain that allows him to have language .

we have designed , and we have worked on the modeling -- and much of these ideas came from Danny and from his team -- the modeling of cancer in the body as complex system .
and I didn &apos;t realize that for three hours I &apos;m sitting at my desk , and I &apos;m not moving at all .
so , the states , are equivalent classes of history , and the cancer patient , the input , is the environment , the diet , the treatment , the genetic mutations .
it &apos;s not . we have no idea the mechanism .
the power of these magnets , the power of what we can do here , is that we can see an individual neutron with this technology .
that cancer recur@@ red , and she passed away three years later from lung cancer , but she got three years from a drug whose symptoms predomin@@ ately were acne .
you don &apos;t need to shrink the disease .
so , to conclude , we need to get away from reduc@@ tionist thinking .
we need a radically different approach .
JH : that &apos;s fantastic .
and that &apos;s something that in painting I &apos;ve never seen done .
you think of yourself as the servant .
one is the large global economy , the large globalized economy , and the other one is the small , and very limited , capacity of our traditional governments and their international institutions to govern , to shape , this economy .
and yet , we all rejected this project , none of the donors was willing to have their name connected with it , and it was the first project to be implemented .
but these bad projects , which were absolutely damaging -- for the economy for many generations , for the environment , for thousands of families who had to be re@@ settled -- they were suddenly put together by con@@ sor@@ tia of banks , of supplier agencies , of insurance agencies -- like in Germany , Her@@ mes , and so on -- and they came back very , very quickly , driven by an un@@ holy alliance between the powerful elites in the countries there and the suppliers from the North .

St@@ acy : just feeling really sad and depressed right now .
this is real , tangible change , real , tangible change .
( Applause ) Thank you .
and there &apos;s certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be , but they will be extremely bad .
probably , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero .
through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting , through different types of cars , different ways of building buildings -- there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially .
so , you know , it &apos;s got lots of challenges ahead , but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward .
the Al Gore book , &quot; Our Choice , &quot; and the David Mac@@ Kay book , &quot; Sustainable Energy Without the H@@ ot Air . &quot;
BG : well , we haven &apos;t picked a particular place , and there &apos;s all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear . &quot;
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as we know this one , but the modular people , that &apos;s a different approach .
we &apos;re working with some of these people .
we want to get people to be more energy efficient .
and , most importantly , there &apos;s a partnership between those perceived defici@@ encies and our greatest creative ability .
we can re-@@ imagine adversity as something more than just tough times .
I think the greatest adversity that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this idea of normal@@ cy .
because it &apos;s moving pretty darn fast on that video .
and we were in for our first surprise .
and for those of you who prefer miles per hour , that &apos;s over 45 miles per hour in water . and this is really darn fast .
we would die by the billions , and very quickly : the wolves would get us , we would be defen@@ seless , we would be unable to grow enough food or find enough food .
but when the scarcity came , when the highs and lows and the droughts came , then people went into starvation .
you put energy into the right kind of system , and out comes wasted heat , entropy , and extro@@ py , which is order .
the amount of energy is increasing through this little sequence .
it &apos;s a branching off from the human form .
and so , every technology is sort of a creative force looking for the right job .
and our guide was a local science teacher .
well it turns out the schools are literally drowning in law .
well how do you fix it ? we could spend 10,000 lifetimes trying to prune this legal jungle .
so , we &apos;re not just talking about physi@@ o@@ logic metrics -- the key measurements of vital signs , and all those things in physiology -- but also all the imaging that one could look at in your smartphone .
and this Wired Magazine cover article really captured a lot of this ; it talked a lot about the Nike shoe and how quickly that &apos;s been adopted to monitor exercise physiology and energy expenditure .
well , I tried this device .
it &apos;s usually 90 percent . so , you tell me you sleep better than expected .
and what it &apos;s trying to do is accelerate this era : to take un@@ met medical needs , to work and innovate -- and we just appointed the chief engineer , Me@@ hran Me@@ h@@ reg@@ any , it was announced on Monday -- then to move up with development , clinical trial validation and then changing medical practice , the most challenging thing of all , requiring attention to reimbur@@ sement , healthcare policy , healthcare economics .
people thought that was crazy .
my mind works like Google for images .
like if I say , &quot; Think about a church steep@@ le , &quot; most people get this sort of generalized generic one .
now , another thing is the sensory issues .

I said , in exchange for education in how to paint , I will support them , and I started a company .
a very , very dear friend of mine came out of the closet , and in India at that time , it was illegal to be gay , and it &apos;s disgusting to see how people respond to a gay person .
I moved back to New York , my work has changed .

CA : well , it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be -- the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years .
OK . we can violate your expectations about shape .
but it wasn &apos;t always like that .
in Indian sport we don &apos;t make things happen , accidents happen and we &apos;re in the right place at the right time , sometimes .

now the reason why this is important is because , by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way , I can look at my entire browsing history in the exact same way .
we talk about drowning in data .
if we can do that , then instead of being trapped in data , we might actually extract information .
( Laughter ) Sounds crazy . but this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality .
but , it struck me how much this dive , these deep dives , was like a space mission .
you get in this capsule , you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can &apos;t get back by yourself .
so , what can we synthesize out of all this ?
and , I don &apos;t know , I kind of get a kick out of that a little bit .
I have a different proposition to suggest to you .
I can demonstrate that to you .
you want to progress , have more money , all of that , is that correct ?
last year here at TED I asked you to give me your data , to put your data on the web , on the basis that if people put data onto the web -- government data , scientific data , community data , whatever it is -- it will be used by other people to do wonderful things , in ways that they never could have imagined .
so , let &apos;s roll the video .
a classic story , the first one which lots of people picked up , was when in March -- on March 10th in fact , soon after TED -- Paul Clarke , in the U.K. government , blo@@ gged , &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve just got some raw data . here it is , it &apos;s about bicycle accidents . &quot;
and he got , from other data sources , information to show which houses are occupied by white people .
in fact , this is the graph of the number of data sets in the reposit@@ ories of dat@@ a.@@ gov , and dat@@ a.@@ go@@ v@@ .@@ uk .
let &apos;s now spin the world during the same year .
that means that if there are five cars waiting , you have to wait till they all go , then you go . it lacks the notion of alternating , or taking turns , and it &apos;s always on the minor road , allowing the major one to have pri@@ macy .
you couldn &apos;t suddenly tell everyone , &quot; OK , remember what you used to do at yield signs ? now do something different . &quot;
and in fact , if you see oil-@@ rich countries , where citizens are not yet empowered , the same thing goes -- Nigeria , Saudi Arabia , all sorts of countries .
recently &quot; The Economist &quot; recognized this , but I stumbled upon the idea 12 years ago , and that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been working on .
so if you lose that precious resource , where you are somewhat equal to the richer countries , that &apos;s a huge waste .
see , you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing .
because some way she could borrow 200 dollars from the bank , get a phone and have the phone for everybody .
that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna .
well , I got on the phone with a few people in the company ; no one could give me a straight answer until finally , I got on the phone with the head biologist .
( Laughter ) &quot; Don , &quot; I said , &quot; what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not economically .
so I interrupted him . I said , &quot; Miguel , what makes your fish taste so good ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Miguel , aren &apos;t they fea@@ sting on your fish ? &quot;
it tasted sweet and clean , like you were taking a bite of the ocean .
how are you going to feed the world ?
one billion people will go hungry today .
and the Sher@@ p@@ as told us then that was a very bad om@@ en , and we should have listened to them .
Everest is an extreme environment .
when you &apos;re in it , you &apos;re like a rat in a maze ; you can &apos;t even see over the top .
and Rob got that message , but his answer was , &quot; We &apos;re both listening . &quot;
T@@ odd and Pete got up to the summit ridge , up in here , and it was a scene of complete chaos up there .
now , you go to this one and you see how much more the frontal lobes are lighting up .
what happens is this .
and so , what I &apos;m going to tell you about is a way to tell a person who &apos;s in trauma -- find a way to de-@@ animate them a bit so they &apos;re a little more immortal when they have that heart attack .
you know ?
yet , it was used as a chemical warfare agent in World War I .
and then , after they get that care -- like the mouse , like the skier , like the 6@@ 5-year-old woman -- they &apos;ll wake up .
there &apos;s lots of others . is the person going to the phone as quickly , when it rings , as they used to ?
and 10 years ago it seemed like I had a lot of time to convince Intel to work on this . right ?
classic . hip fracture often leads to institution@@ alization of a senior .
I can &apos;t stop this from happening .
and so , now what we &apos;re looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtu@@ oso gamers .
so I &apos;ve started to think about what these games are making us virtu@@ os@@ os at .
and he &apos;s an economist , so he &apos;s rational .
that was the first real-time strategy game from the World of Warcraft series .
this is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on .
and I thought it was astonishing to speculate , as if this were a competition , on something that was such a fresh wound .
we took about 20 or 30 architects and designers and artists , and over four days -- it was like this urban bar@@ n-@@ raising -- to renov@@ ate it , and everyone wanted to help .
so we came up with a foundation , and actually what happened was one major developer in New York -- KA : who shall remain nameless , I guess ?
the next day I got an email from the developer saying that he was with@@ drawing all funding .
you know , a couple of years this thing isn &apos;t going to be here .
I think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue that we felt may not have been happening enough in this city , about what &apos;s really happening there .
this shows Saint Paul &apos;s on the left .
and we &apos;re beginning to find these little things for malaria , for sickle cell , for cancers .
because this Friday , 50 years ago , Watson and Crick found the structure of DNA , and that is almost as important a date as the 12th of February when we first mapped ourselves , but anyway , we &apos;ll get to that .
because if you can live in radiation that looks like this , that brings up a whole series of interesting questions .
takes about 3 million dollars the second time .
and here &apos;s an interesting map .
that &apos;s the power of visual storytelling , that &apos;s the power of dance , that &apos;s the power of music : the power of not knowing .
in Delhi , we used to live -- we used to call it a ch@@ hat or the k@@ hot@@ a .
so , I will go further , and I say , &quot; I tell a story , and therefore I exist . &quot;
are you with child ?
are you with child ?
Thank you very much .
now , why wouldn &apos;t this undermine an objective morality ?
what are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing ?
we live in a world filled with destructive technology , and this technology cannot be un@@ invented ; it will always be easier to break things than to fix them .
do people love their daughters just as much in these systems ?
sh : well yeah , mod@@ ul@@ o one obvious fact , that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system .
look where the methane is , the methane is in a very rough terrain area .
but , of equal importance , as we fly through the atmosphere of Mars , we transmit that journey , the first flight of an airplane outside of the Earth , we transmit those images back to Earth .
and the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us , inspires and unites us .
around the world , slaves are used to destroy the environment , cutting down trees in the Amazon ; destroying forest areas in West Africa ; mining and spreading mercury around in places like Ghana and the Congo ; destroying the coastal ecosystems in South Asia .
well , amazingly , in places like India where costs are very low , that family , that three-@@ generation family that you see there who were in hereditary slavery -- so , that granddad there , was born a baby into slavery -- but the total cost , am@@ or@@ tized across the rest of the work , was about 150 dollars to bring that family out of slavery and then take them through a two year process to build a stable life of citizenship and education .
a boy in Ghana rescued from fishing slavery , about 400 dollars .
so , June it rains , so many a times all of us would be huddled under the tin roof , waiting for the rain to stop .
can you teach us ? &quot; so , we started an after@@ school for our parents , for our mothers .
they are really exc@@ elling .
I &apos;d like to begin this song I wrote about ce@@ as@@ eless yearning and never-ending want with a poem of popular Pe@@ tr@@ archa@@ n paradoxes by Sir Thomas Wy@@ att the El@@ der : &quot; I find no peace , and all my war is done ; I fear and hope , I burn and freeze like ice ; I fly above the wind , and yet I cannot arise ; And naught I have , and all the world I seize upon . &quot;
okay , that was kind of cool .
Britain will starve without genetically modified crops .
now , there he is calling to his friends .
for kids like me , being called childish can be a frequent occurrence .
we love challenges , but when expectations are low , trust me , we will sink to them .
I don &apos;t know , you &apos;re kind of alien@@ ating a large client there .
are we any more rational about sex ?
you can only HIV by having unprotected sex with a positive person .
so essentially , you &apos;re able to achieve quite high rates of condom use in commercial sex .
and trust me , I &apos;ve got a day job , I &apos;ve got a lot of day jobs .
look what it takes to make things like iPods .
we &apos;re here to help you . we need data . we need to know what you need . &quot;
we go back to Walter Reed , and a kid , literally , 20 some@@ -@@ odd days before that was blown up .
I went down to Washington . I saw these guys , and said , &quot; I did what you asked me . I looked at what &apos;s out there .
we call that the concept of passive dynamic locomotion .
what you &apos;re doing is , when you stand up , potential energy to kinetic energy , potential energy to kinetic energy .
now , we don &apos;t have enough time to go into technical details , I &apos;ll just show you some of the experiments .
we do something to something , and just like magic , it moves .
it takes really a lot of time and it &apos;s expensive to train the operator to operate this complex arm .
like I said , pollen carries the male sex cells .
this one I particularly like .
this is Rachel Field , Robert Gra@@ ves -- a very young Robert Gra@@ ves -- Chri@@ stina Ros@@ sett@@ i .
and here &apos;s her poem .
he was moved to by the Trac@@ tarian Movement , the Oxford Movement , otherwise known as -- and he became a Jes@@ uit priest .
at the time , he was teaching classics at Trin@@ ity College in Dublin .
Thank you so much .
same thing , only bigger .
ask questions , demand proof , demand evidence .
the data came back from the United States , from England , from Sweden , from Canada , and it was all the same : no correlation , no connection , none at all .
no one &apos;s ever said that before .
I know you did because half of Americans do every day .
now , the most mindless epidemic we &apos;re in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between propon@@ ents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
these gorillas were murdered , some would even say cruci@@ fied , and unsurprisingly , they sparked international outrage .
thankfully , when these photos appeared in The Guardian in 1998 , they put a lot of focus and attention and , in the end , a lot of money towards the Sudan famine relief efforts .
John Moore set up this photo at Ar@@ l@@ ington Ce@@ me@@ tery .
and soon , I became the leader of that infamous organization that was led by that man in that alley who recruited me that day , who was America &apos;s first neo-Nazi skin@@ head and who had radicalized me .
and if only I &apos;d been brave enough to walk away at that moment , to understand what the struggle was that was happening inside of me , then maybe tragedy could have been a@@ verted .
and within a few months .
already it is possible to sequence the entire genetic code of a bacterium in under four hours .
but each of these species , even the tiniest Prochloro@@ coc@@ ci , are masterpieces of evolution .
it makes all key information about life on Earth accessible to anyone , on demand , anywhere in the world .
in fact , there &apos;s a surge channel where the tide is moving back and forth , twice a day , pretty rapidly .
and as these tectonic plates are spreading apart , magma , lava is coming up and filling those gaps , and you &apos;re looking land -- new land -- being created right before your eyes .
and this vent fluid is about 600 or 700 degrees F .
fair enough question .
create a healing zone in your neighborhood and encourage others to do the same .
look in your own backyard , in fact , look in the mirror .
and I applaud that . I loudly applaud that .
and she pointed to the work on the left to tell me how problematic this image was , as it related , for her , to the idea of how black people had been represented .
fast-forward and I end up in Harlem ; home for many of black America , very much the psychic heart of the black experience , really the place where the Harlem Renaissance existed .
to this end , the specific project that has made this possible for me is a series of exhibitions , all titled with an F -- Fre@@ est@@ yle , F@@ requ@@ ency and F@@ low -- which have set out to discover and define the young , black artists working in this moment who I feel strongly will continue to work over the next many years .
for me , it is about re-@@ imagining this cultural discourse in an international context .
and there are a few other land-@@ dwellers that can make light -- some insects , earthworms , fungi -- but in general , on land , it &apos;s really rare .
ignore the instructions , that &apos;s what the government has to put in there to confuse you , I &apos;m sure .
and what does he do ? he likes to tell you how the deceased got deceased , the people he &apos;s talking to through his ear , you see ?
now , Mon@@ tel Williams is an intelligent man .
and this has already saved millions of lives , and it has prevented entire economies from cap@@ sizing in Sub-Saharan Africa .
I invite your interest as well as your involvement in driving this vision to a point of practical reality .
so in paragraph number one , what I &apos;m going to tell you to do is very simply this : you appreciate them .
and you actually get into the folder that the elected official actually has to read .
there &apos;s also a time to give .
but I was driven by an inherent sense that a picture that revealed the true face of war would almost by definition be an anti-@@ war photograph .
I went to Congo with M@@ SF , and contributed to a book and an exhibition that focused attention on a forgotten war in which millions of people have died , and exposure to disease without treatment is used as a weapon .
and suddenly , queues became shorter .
in March 2017 , the mayor of Cape Town officially declared Cape Town a local disaster , as it had less than four months left of usable water .
the mayor described this as that it means a new relationship with water .
taking me to lesson three : look below the surface .
and what &apos;s really cool is that that knowledge which you just acquired moments ago is changing how you experience these blobs right now .
we have to make them meaningful .
now your brain does come pre@@ wired to make some feelings , simple feelings that come from the physiology of your body .
but these simple feelings are not emotions .
Salaam . N@@ ama@@ sk@@ ar .
but barely six months into my new job , I met a woman who forced me to challenge all my assumptions .
Leymah was not an activist , she was a mother of three .
they &apos;ve also saved me from my righteous anger by offering insights into this third way .
that &apos;s Malcolm X and the suffra@@ gists and gay pride parades .
CA : why did that make so much impact ?
in fact , the whole world used to look like that .
so in a sense , my long-term goal at this point is to not only bring back those animals and the grassland they made , which could be a climate stabili@@ zation system over the long run , but even the mammoths there in the background that are part of the story .
SB : the story that &apos;s out there is that we &apos;re in the middle of the Six@@ th Ex@@ tin@@ ction or maybe in the beginning of the Six@@ th Ex@@ tin@@ ction .
none of those species are probably going to go extinct .
likewise , farmland has now peaked , and one of the ways that plays out in Europe is there &apos;s a lot of abandoned farmland now , which immediately re@@ forests .
SB : potentially . it &apos;s -- ( Laughter ) There &apos;s three groups , basically , working on the woolly mammoth seriously : revive &amp; amp ; R@@ est@@ ore , we &apos;re kind of in the middle ; George Church and the group at Harvard that are doing the genetics in the lab ; and then there &apos;s an amazing old scientist named Zi@@ mov who works in northern Siberia , and his son Nik@@ ita , who has bought into the system , and they are , Sergey and Nik@@ ita Zi@@ mov have been , for 25 years , creating what they call &quot; Ple@@ i@@ sto@@ cene Park , &quot; which is a place in a really tough part of Siberia that is pure tundra .
and the world seems to have decided that &apos;s OK .
( Laughter ) That was discouraging .
lawyers are crucial in that fight , no doubt , but we can &apos;t leave it to lawyers alone .
without an ID , you can &apos;t apply for a job .
it &apos;s not hard to find , if you look .
so it was only in Belgium , where the artist had once lived , that K@@ ob@@ al managed to find someone that knew the artist personally and gave him the contact .
cur@@ ation is at the heart of everything we do .
in this test , you have four minutes .
so , for example , what else would you do with a key , other than to use it for opening up a lock ?
so just walking at a comfortable pace is a good choice .
and if you look at things like the iPhone app , the fraction is considerably larger .
here &apos;s something where we &apos;re sort of integrating a bunch of different capabilities here .
well , so , that leads to kind of an ultimate question : could it be that someplace out there in the computational universe we might find our physical universe ?
Stephen Wolfram : well , the parts of physics that we kind of know to be true , things like the standard model of physics : what I &apos;m trying to do better reproduce the standard model of physics or it &apos;s simply wrong .
I didn &apos;t look the part .
I don &apos;t know for sure that the Brits invented this particular view of the world , but I suspect we might have done so : we are right in the middle , and we &apos;ve cut the Pacific in half and flung it to the far corners of the world .
the first attempt didn &apos;t go so well .
but when I wrote that obituary exercise , I actually grew up a little bit in that moment and realized that I needed to create my own future .
all of you know about the topic that I &apos;m supposed to talk about .
and you then ask the question : why is the water hot ?
one of the things I want to do is to help you with a very important task -- which you may not know that you have very often -- which is to understand how to sit next to a physicist at a dinner party and have a conversation . ( Laughter ) And the words that I would like you to focus on are complexity and emergence , because these will enable you to start the conversation and then daydream about other things .
a transistor is nothing more than a wall switch .
the characteristics , which I think are useful to think about for simple things : first , they are predictable .
you can build cathedrals out of stones , you just have to know what it does .
what that means is that you have to have a high performance or value for cost .
but if you have something that has a function , and it &apos;s really cheap , people will find new ways of putting it together to make new things .
we cannot keep giving lentils to people . &quot;
so , first , it &apos;s mostly invisible ; second , it &apos;s huge ; and third , we don &apos;t know whether we are doing the right thing .
as it turns out , all the great inspiring leaders and organizations in the world , whether it &apos;s Apple or Martin Luther King or the Wright brothers , they all think , act and communicate the exact same way .
as a result , the way we think , we act , the way we communicate is from the outside in , it &apos;s obvious .
we go from the clearest thing to the fu@@ zz@@ iest thing .
they had no money ; they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop .
and lo and behold , look what happened .
the next 34 % are your early majority , your late majority and your lag@@ gar@@ ds .
it &apos;s a commercial example .
and when they went IP@@ O , their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then plummeted , and it &apos;s never traded above 10 .
Dr. King believed that there are two types of laws in this world : those that are made by a higher authority and those that are made by men .
she was with me on my life@@ boat .

even in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing .
I joked that the main contribution we made to the battle against AIDS was to get the manufacturers to change from a jewelry store to a grocery store strategy .
we &apos;re essentially implementing what Paul Farmer did in Haiti : he develops and trains paid community health workers who are able to identify health problems , ensure that people who have AIDS or TB are properly diagnosed and take their medicine regularly , who work on bringing about health education , clean water and sanitation , providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care if they have problems of the severity that require it .
and the most important thing is because we &apos;ve implemented Paul Farmer &apos;s model , using community health workers , we estimate that this system could be put into place for all of Rwanda for between five and six percent of GDP , and that the government could sustain that without depending on foreign aid after five or six years .
we were the best and the brightest .
and that was the beginning of a kind of serial depletion from bigger and tas@@ tier species to smaller and not-so-@@ tasty species , from species that were near to home to species that were all around the world , and what have you .
the reason that it attracted so much attention , besides the fact that it &apos;s disgusting , is that sea birds flying over it are as@@ phy@@ xi@@ ated by the smell and die , and a farmer died of it , and you can imagine the scandal that happened .
can you tell me where has it been taken from , and what is it meant for ? anybody ?
and she does it a few thousand times every day .
doing what ? breaking stones , digging earth .
Kab@@ ir , Ra@@ him , all the great Sufi saints , they were all poor people , and they had a great reason . ( Applause ) Please do not ever think that only after meeting your physiological needs and other needs can you be thinking about your spiritual needs or your enlightenment .
so here &apos;s a model where a two-@@ wheel@@ er washing machine ...
he is washing your clothes and drying them at your doorstep .
now , what we need is , we need people who will be able to scale them up .
and who knows ? somebody will license this technology and develop marke@@ table products , and she would get revenue .
even love needs help from technology .
and the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother .
another possibility , very obvious , is hom@@ ophi@@ ly , or , birds of a feather flock together ; here , I form my tie to you because you and I share a similar body size .
now , what is the point of this ?
our experience of the world depends on the actual structure of the networks in which we &apos;re resi@@ ding and on all the kinds of things that ripple and flow through the network .
so we made this thing .
there &apos;s all these different interventions but they have different kinds of effectiveness .
and this is this latter part of the rainy season .
so we thought , &quot; Well , we &apos;ve done all these things that are focused on the P@@ las@@ modi@@ um , the parasite involved .
that &apos;s CB@@ D and THC .
and before the 1970s , cannabis contained less than half of a percent of THC .
now , the reason why the commercial market has so rapidly exploded is because there is a hell of a lot of money to be made in satisfying and increasing our desire to get high .
Ben C@@ ort : I &apos;m actually glad you brought that up .
we did 250 hours of diving here in 2005 .
and they would make 4,000 dollars per year , total , for the entire fishery , several fishing boats .
you &apos;re saying we &apos;re spending 35 billion dollars now on subsidies .
but what you have here is actually four separate layers , and I &apos;m curious which of you can see the four separate layers and , particularly , how when they &apos;re compressed together and presented to the student all at once , how that creates this impatient problem solving .
so now we have a water tank .
how long will it take you to fill it up ? and that &apos;s it .
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s terrifying , because the theoretical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher &apos;s edition , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical .
we need more patient problem solvers . Thank you . ( Applause )
don &apos;t give any more information . &quot; ( Laughter ) So I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
and I said , &quot; Well , Men , through their penis , they fertilize the eggs by the sperm coming out .
and I said , &quot; Oh , no . humans are so private .
how did you get started and how did this all evolve ?
that &apos;s the person who carries the torch into the world .
and if I &apos;m standing here in front of you today , it &apos;s because I owe my life to the stubborn@@ ness and commitment of one car@@ er .
there &apos;s a medical revolution happening all around us , and it &apos;s one that &apos;s going to help us conquer some of society &apos;s most dreaded conditions , including cancer .
in muscle , they cor@@ k@@ screw , so that muscles can contract without cutting off circulation .
his veterinarian only gave him three months to live .
I thought about it , and when I was four , I was already the oldest of four children , and my mother even had another child to come , so what I think she -- understandably -- really meant was that she was so ready , she was so ready .
and they said , &quot; Well , it &apos;s because God gave women a gift that is so spectacular , it is so wonderful , that the only gift he had left over to give men was the gift of prophecy . &quot;
but then the more I thought about it , the more I had to be honest with myself .
environmentally , meat , amazingly , causes more emissions than all of transportation combined : cars , trains , planes , buses , boats , all of it .
so really , any of these angles should have been enough to convince me to go vegetarian .
so you want to swap those out with some good , sustainably harvested fish .
so we changed these houses into people .
we can go this way , too .
so this particular woman in Malawi , when she brushes her teeth , she scrap@@ es some mud off from her wall and she mixes it with water , and then she &apos;s brushing .
and what the penguins show us -- and these are all the little dots from where the penguins &apos; positions were for penguins in incub@@ ation in 2003 -- and what you see is some of these individuals are going 800 kilometers away from their nests .
what &apos;s different is how the molecules are put together .
and why ? because the lowly abalone is able to lay down the calcium carbonate crystals in layers , making this beautiful , i@@ ri@@ descent mother of pearl .
so we took the same my@@ co@@ i@@ des genome that Car@@ ole had initially transplanted , and we grew that in yeast as an artificial chromosome .
when we did these experiments , though , we could get the chromosome out of yeast but it wouldn &apos;t transplant and boot up a cell .
and I say , &quot; No , no , it tells the date as well . &quot;
I don &apos;t mean you shouldn &apos;t go , but not everybody needs to go , or go now .
they &apos;re trying to put together a signature look , an aesthetic that reflects who they are .
if you look at the registry , actually , a lot of the registered things in the E.@@ U .
they &apos;re smart .
SO@@ C : I , in my research , have seen that the Taliban have perfected the way in which they recruit and train children , and I think it &apos;s a five-@@ step process .
they separate the parents from the children by promising to provide food , clothing , shelter to these children .
step five : I believe the Taliban have one of the most effective means of propaganda .
do you want to carry out a suicide attack ?
most of us worry about things we can &apos;t control , like war , terrorism , the tragic earthquake that just occurred in Haiti .
the inv@@ ader draws the attention of the immune system &apos;s front-@@ line troops .
as variable as flu is , HIV makes flu look like the Rock of Gibr@@ altar .
and if you guys have ideas to help us solve this , we &apos;d love to hear about it .
let me give you another example .
and I have to tell you , this is an un@@ adulter@@ ated piece of software , this is a real Internet browser and this is the actual Google site , and we &apos;re going to test it out live today .
( Laughter ) So really , what are we talking about here ?
( Laughter ) It &apos;s , like -- seriously , though -- ( Laughter ) I try to create meaningful environments for people to express themselves .
it dances to music .
they want to regulate us , those conservatives , to stop us from allowing the market to spread in those places .
and the guy who shot it obviously has a strong eye and some experience with video editing .
JS : so that &apos;s importantly different from the earlier videos we looked at because here , remix isn &apos;t just about an individual doing something alone in his basement ; it becomes an act of social creativity .
okay , for a second example , think about this cultural hero , icon on the Left , creator of this character .
look at the site that he built : &quot; star Wars &quot; M@@ ash@@ U@@ ps , inviting people to come and use their creative energy to produce a new generation of attention towards this extraordinarily important cultural icon .
it is an extraordinary per@@ version of the system of freedom we should be encouraging .
so here was a room in which all the walls , floors , ceilings , pets , pot@@ ted plants , whatever was in there , were capable , not only of display but of sensing as well .
so , whether it &apos;s logistics and supply chain management or natural gas and resource extraction , financial services , pharmaceuticals , bio@@ informa@@ tics , those are the topics right now , but that &apos;s not a killer app .
and I wanted to tell stories about all the amazing things I was seeing underwater , incredible wildlife and interesting behaviors .
this is a photo that I made showing one of these pups that &apos;s only about five or seven days old -- still has a little bit of the um@@ bi@@ lical cord on its belly -- that has fallen in because of the thin ice , and the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe and to get it back to stable purchase .
and I wanted to show several species that we hadn &apos;t shown much in the magazine and worked in a number of locations .
and I think it &apos;s a gentler picture , a little less threatening , a little more respectful of the species .
they hold on to them , and it eventually kills them .
and that &apos;s because the urchins eat kelp .
I became an underwater photographer because I fell in love with the sea , and I make pictures of it today because I want to protect it , and I don &apos;t think it &apos;s too late .
and it was a Japanese forum and ima@@ ge@@ board .
and saying whatever you like , I think , is powerful .
this is the U.K. government spend .
so what we &apos;re saying , essentially , is maybe that &apos;s a habitat for life in the solar system .
and we were very excited about this because , of course , they have a history of dancing with machines .
they &apos;re responsible for this video , &quot; Here It G@@ oes Again . &quot;
now , for those of you who don &apos;t know , a Ru@@ be Goldberg machine is a complicated contraption , an incredibly over-@@ engineered piece of machinery that accompli@@ shes a relatively simple task .
life can be messy .
soon after that , I reached out to my brother here , with the attitude that we had both lost a son .
there is no tougher job on the planet than raising another human being and making sure they &apos;re safe , secure and well-@@ positioned to be successful in life .
and at the presence of an 18-year-old who comman@@ ded him and two 14-year-old boys he thought were his friends , he shot and killed Tariq Kha@@ mis@@ a , this man &apos;s son .
yes , because his int@@ on@@ ations will be of a person that pulled the trigger .
suppose you were on the Supreme Court .
( Laughter ) So if golfing is the kind of game that can be played while riding around in a golf cart , it would be hard to confer on the golfing gre@@ ats the status that we confer , the honor and recognition that goes to truly great athletes .
very hard to argue about justice without first arguing about the purpose of social institutions and about what qualities are worthy of honor and recognition .
it &apos;s robotics .
it turns out that there &apos;s this important human dimension -- a personality dimension called lo@@ cus of control , and people who have a strong internal lo@@ cus of control , they need to be the masters of their own destiny -- really don &apos;t like giving up control to an autonomous system -- so much so that they will fight the autonomy ; &quot; If I want to hit that chair , I &apos;m going to hit that chair . &quot;
it &apos;s a little bit like &quot; En@@ der &apos;s Game , &quot; right ?
that &apos;s what I found by flying low and slow all over the African continent as I photographed the spectacle of its diversity .
well , that notion stayed with me , and 20 years later , after becoming a professional photographer , I was able to talk National Geographic into doing a big story in the central Sahara , and I came back with a new kind of flying machine .
( Laughter ) To calm myself down , I started taking pictures , and as I did , I became rational again , and I was getting buff@@ eted by a Har@@ mat@@ tan wind which was coming out of the upper right hand corner of this picture , and I started to notice how it had filled the entire crater with sand .
this picture was taken in southern Algeria , where the locals have learned how to garden in a mobile dune field by tapping into shallow groundwater .
in a continent as dynamic and diverse as Africa , sometimes it seems that the only constant is change .
it would be pointless to mop or plunge or scoop up the water if we don &apos;t turn off the tap first .
we then match the church with the poor .
here is our tradition : at every Hi@@ mba village , there is a sacred fire .
and sometimes , once they were caught , they were treated with respect , brought back into the communities and they were made part of the bigger dreams .
our government has given legal status over our traditional lands .
they stay very much far away because this other thing has multiplied from less than a thousand to tens of thousands of animals .
for inspiration , you go to YouTube and you watch his speech at Rice University , September of 1962 , the &quot; moon shot &quot; speech .
step out , step up .
one of them was : why is it necessary to spend six billion pounds speeding up the Eur@@ os@@ tar train when , for about 10 percent of that money , you could have top super@@ models , male and female , serving free Ch@@ ateau Pe@@ tr@@ us to all the passengers for the entire duration of the journey ?
however , you pick them up and underneath , actually engraved in the metal , are the words , &quot; St@@ olen from Virgin Atlantic Air@@ ways upper-@@ class . &quot;
that &apos;s the world people actually want .
so if you add these two together , alone , you can see a separation that nuclear puts out at least nine to 17 times more CO2 equivalent emissions than wind energy .
if you go to nuclear , you do get a big reduction , but it &apos;s not as much as with wind and concentrated solar .
that &apos;s cellul@@ os@@ ic , second generation biofuels from prairie grass .
this is based on ranges from data , but if you look at nuclear , it would be the size of Rhode Island to power the U.S. vehicle fleet .
of those , seven have nuclear weapons .
the sound system was kind of decent .
there &apos;s no big room to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms .
and , as with jazz , the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others .
automobile music , you can share with your friends .
( Laughter ) And in some ways it &apos;s like Carnegie Hall , or when the audience had to hus@@ h up , because you can now hear every single detail .
it &apos;s like a water dow@@ sing device .
sometimes it was even spinning around twice counter@@ clockwise , once clockwise and p@@ eck the key twice .
while you &apos;re thinking about that , this was an experiment done by Susan Black@@ more , a psychologist in England , who showed subjects this degraded image and then ran a correlation between their scores on an ES@@ P test : how much did they believe in the paranormal , supernatural , angels and so forth .
here is what you show subjects .
so you &apos;re more likely to feel in a euph@@ oric state , creativity , find more patterns .
so perhaps more dopamine is related to more creativity .
you know , of course , this is V@@ ia U@@ no shoes .
I think it &apos;s the basis of ani@@ mism and poly@@ the@@ ism and mono@@ the@@ ism .
because it worked .
or you can do it through loss of consciousness , by accelerating in a centrifuge .
we really can &apos;t see very far .
when we think of mar@@ ine-@@ protected areas for animals like dolphins , this means that we have to be quite conscious about activities that we thought were benign .
and I &apos;d like to switch now from this local , familiar , coastal environment to a much broader world of the baleen whales and the open ocean .
I think one of the most interesting examples of this comes from Australia .
the most dominant sound that humans put into the ocean comes from shipping .
and when they also add in strong employee training programs , they get a 3.@@ 4 percentage point premium on their margins .
the job of business is to meet customer needs and to do so profit@@ ably .
they &apos;re all spot@@ -@@ on their core business .
not only did he get me one , but I had to get two .
that &apos;s wrong , for me , if you want to raise entrepreneurs .
these three levels of the hierarchy needs relate to the five levels of Maslow &apos;s hierarchy of needs .
over dinner , I asked him an imper@@ tinent question .
why in the heck in America are we doing a census in 2010 ?
I was physically exhausted , mentally an absolute wreck , considered myself a failure .
my brother sent me a text message , an SMS -- it was a quote from the &quot; Simp@@ sons . &quot; it said , &quot; You tried your hardest and failed miserably .
two Norwe@@ gi@@ ans did it as a team in 2000 . no one &apos;s done it solo .
and it &apos;s also about potential , on a personal level .
I &apos;m certain I can see you bl@@ us@@ hing .
what is it that &apos;s worth spending my time on and my life on in this way ?
and it also supports working-class kids going into Indian schools .
when they got to a certain stage , Pra@@ tham got big enough to attract some pro bon@@ o support from McKin@@ sey .
McKin@@ sey came along and looked at his model and said , &quot; You know what you should do with this , Mad@@ ha@@ v ?
seven-year-old Justin Sen@@ ig@@ ar came to our clinic with this diagnosis of very severe autism .
I spend a lot time in my work talking to people about who we are , who we must be and what our healing looks like .
so instead , I thought it would probably be a better idea if I went home and wrote .
LOLcats are cute pictures of cats made cu@@ ter with the addition of cute cap@@ tions .
and deter@@ rence theory is a very simple theory of human behavior : if you want somebody to do less of something , add a punishment and they &apos;ll do less of it .
so why is this important ?
I mean , that &apos;s 2005 figures .
it turns out , all sorts of things .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens with PD@@ B@@ s in this food pyramid : they accumulate into the top of it .
some of them were illegal whale meat , by the way .
that change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift , not only in the fortunes of Monterey Bay , but other places around the world .
the most expensive real estate on this planet in every city -- Wil@@ shire Bou@@ levard , or Fifth Avenue , or Tokyo , or Paris -- the most expensive real estate is their down@@ towns .
your choice , when living in a city , if it &apos;s now 10 minutes -- because at 30 minutes you want an alternative , whether it &apos;s a bus , a train -- we &apos;ve got to build an infrastructure -- a light rail -- or you &apos;re going to keep parking those cars .
and women shouldn &apos;t have to spend four hours a day looking for it , or watching their kids die .
well , scream buddy is a portable space for screaming .
they invented a way to do a construction kit out of a cardboard box -- which , as you see up there , that &apos;s becoming a business -- but their design was better than Saul &apos;s design at MIT , so there &apos;s now three students at MIT doing their theses on scaling the work of eight-year-old children because they had better designs .
real invention is happening in these labs .
these Fab Labs are the cost and complexity of a P@@ DP .
as an architect , I have to confront something like this .
and we do something different than what we did in the past ; we add kind of a modi@@ cu@@ m of intelligence to that .
this is perhaps the glue that holds all these conditions together .
the concept is that we speak in the exact same manner about someone who &apos;s not in the room as if they are in the room .
in fact , Blue School was founded on a balance between academic mastery , creative thinking , and self and social intelligence .
and challenge ourselves , practice being OK , making mistakes , and support each other through them .
for us , for me , it was about prioritizing children &apos;s voices to give them the tools to help build a harmon@@ ious and sustainable world .
regularity is the contrary of roughness because the basic aspect of the world is very rough .
if you cut , with a sharp knife , one of the flo@@ re@@ ts of a cau@@ li@@ flower and look at it separately , you think of a whole cau@@ li@@ flower , but smaller .
to begin with , artificial landscapes , which I invented sort of , are used in cinema all the time .
it used to be very time-consuming , but now it &apos;s nothing .
and the others say , no , five basketball &#91; courts &#93; .
a man named Pe@@ ano did define such curves , and it became an object of extraordinary interest .
if you aggregate it , it &apos;s the third largest economy on Earth , and yet most of these people go invisible .
they work in government offices . they &apos;re drivers .
this family , Sar@@ ita and her husband , bought a 15-@@ dollar unit when they were living in a -- literally a three-@@ walled le@@ an-@@ to with a cor@@ ru@@ gated iron roof .
right now , 95 percent of these nets are being bought by the U.N. , and then given primarily to people around Africa .
the other thing that &apos;s dramatic is that both hunger and obesity have really risen in the last 30 years .
who is farming ? that &apos;s what I was wondering .
and how are we going to get those kids those nutritious foods ?
trees epit@@ om@@ ize st@@ asis .
and I decided to explore this movement by turning trees into artists .
they are now buying cars .
and these lower or middle income countries , the emerging income countries , they will also forge forwards economically .
they are still up here .
on top of that , one of the core principles of Ja@@ in@@ ism is something called &quot; non-@@ absolu@@ tism . &quot;
( Laughter ) Now , a couple of interesting things about N@@ ones are : there are a lot of us , and we ske@@ w young .
that can &apos;t be good , because if a lot of highly spiritual people are currently god@@ less , maybe finding God is not going to be as easy as I had originally hoped .
but remember , I &apos;m a non-@@ absolu@@ tist , which means I was pretty inclined to keep a fairly open mind , which turned out to be a good thing , because I went to a witch &apos;s pot@@ luck dinner at the LGBT Center in New York City , where I be@@ friended two witches ; drank a five-@@ gallon jer@@ ri@@ can full of volcanic water with a shaman in Peru ; got a hug from a saint in the convention center -- she smelled really nice -- ( Laughter ) chanted for hours in a smo@@ ke-@@ filled , heat-@@ infused sweat lo@@ dge on the beaches of Mexico ; worked with a te@@ quil@@ a-@@ drinking medium to conven@@ e with the dead , who oddly included both my deceased mother-in-law and the deceased manager of the hip-hop group The Roots .
and that is much harder to change .
we want every girl , parent and &#91; future &#93; husband to know what the hymen is and how it works .
I &apos;m basically just a guy that likes to go fishing ever since I was a little kid , and because I did , I wound up studying sea birds to try to stay in the coastal habitats that I so loved .
and we just seem to be unable to figure out what to do .
but really , where are those birds going to get released to ?
and there &apos;s another difference too , which is the object on the left is made from one substance .
no other animal does it .
that &apos;s how you got to be rich ; you employed them .
in the case of the stone axe , the man who made it knew how to make it .
it &apos;s the inter@@ change of ideas , the meeting and mating of ideas between them , that is causing technological progress , incrementally , bit by bit .
it includes things like the Internet cables .
now one other thing women like my grandma do in Turkey is to cover mirrors with vel@@ vet or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out .
I was constantly telling stories at home , which was good , except I told this to imaginary friends around me , which was not so good .
I &apos;m intrigued by this concept .
we see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the d@@ j@@ inn , who are made of smo@@ k@@ eless fire and are the symbol of el@@ usi@@ veness .
so I went there in 2007 , and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election -- the national election , December 28 .
and it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan TV , shifted the vote by 10 percent , according to a Kenyan intelligence report , which changed the result of the election .
we don &apos;t have sources who are dissidents on other sources .
JA : so this is a sample of what we do sort of every day .
that &apos;s a problem .
JA : yeah . and you know , I &apos;m a comb@@ ative person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on the nurture , but some way -- there is another way of nurturing victims , which is to police perpetrators of crime .
it was the hardest hit of any country in the world .
the second is Columbus finally gets funded to go to India , but he gets lost .
after a while , his advisers complained .
then there &apos;s a group that believes the Koran is a living , breathing document , and I captured that idea within these stones that self-@@ update .
and the last point about the 99 Noor stones is this .
and we entered Western consciousness with a tag@@ line : &quot; next R@@ ama@@ dan , the world will have new heroes , &quot; back in 2005 .
what happens is the world erup@@ ts in the Danish cartoon controversy .
Mi@@ k@@ los : must download file contents .
I trained at Bel@@ lev@@ ue Hospital Sur@@ vi@@ v@@ ors of Poli@@ tical Tor@@ ture Program , and I heard one too many stories of people growing up to i@@ do@@ lize their leadership , only to end up being tortured by their heroes .
( Laughter ) She was actually coming out of an Amnesty International meeting .
( Applause )
so this is what I could display here .
and to show that , you can put on the way of United Arab Emirates .
we have data in the United Nations , in the national statistical agencies and in universities and other non@@ governmental organizations .
and if , in the next couple of months , you walk out in the early evening and look straight up and place you palm like this , you will actually be looking at the field of the sky where this telescope is searching for planets day and night , without any inter@@ ruption , for the next four years .
finally , 15 years ago , the technology came to the point where we could discover a planet around another star , and we actually did pretty well .
and a lot of the good news comes from that part of the bridge that we are trying to build as well .
now this is just an example to tell you the pathway in which we are trying to answer that bigger question about the universality of the phenomenon .
so life might be insignificant in size , but it is not insignificant in time .
man : now blink right to go right .
so these terrible , terrible people online , they would destroy everything that they tried to make , they would steal all their stuff , and they would kill them over and over again , making the game virtually un@@ play@@ able .
some started to share , even give things to other people .
she explained that he had gone blind in one eye and was losing his vision in the other .
he talked about how she loved knitting .
personally , I plan to be cre@@ mated , but given that I get se@@ asi@@ ck , I can think of nothing worse than having my ashes flung into a huge ocean swell .
let &apos;s consider an alternative path .
and so we can regrow these surfaces biologically .
well here &apos;s how we &apos;re going to do it .
resting on the sauc@@ er were two packets of sugar .
Americans tend to believe that they &apos;ve reached some sort of pinnacle in the way they practice choice .
with this procedure , we were able to ensure that the kids across the three groups all did the same activity , making it easier for us to compare performance .
&quot; Oh , but it doesn &apos;t matter .
it &apos;s predicted they may go extinct -- about a third of them -- within about 30 years .
so , in our study , we did find quite high levels , as we expected , of these flame retar@@ d@@ ants in the harbor seals &apos; bodies .
well , we detected 1@@ 13 different compounds in my blood .
and you could just see the web of death as you go down in the water column .
and then there &apos;s the looming , messy problem of human health , reported human health effects .
Corexit also contains petroleum solvents and many other toxic compounds .
which means that somebody gets wiped out , and then everything above that &apos;s eating those guys will crash .
actually the kelp and the bar@@ nacles that attach to the rock were decimated by the combination of Corexit and the oil .
another is that there are bold , new ways of studying oceans that we have not used well yet .
this is very , very important because this is the system , this is the cruci@@ ble , out of which life on the planet came , and it &apos;s now time for us to understand it .
they will bring it and link it in .
now , that mound right there actually looks like this .
there are emerging technologies throughout the field around ocean@@ ography , which we will incorporate into ocean@@ ography , and through that convergence , we will transform ocean@@ ography into something even more magical .
so the presence of the power and the bandwidth in the environment will allow all of these new technologies to converge in a manner that is just unprecedented .
and what we see is that people tend to keep making errors exactly the same way , over and over again .
what you &apos;re looking at over here is actually the first unit that I know of of non-human currency .
like most of our money , it &apos;s just a piece of metal .
this is A and B are kind of the points where she &apos;s sort of a little bit curious about these things -- doesn &apos;t know .
and over time , they did basically the same thing so the monkeys could learn , you know , who sold what at what price -- you know , who was reliable , who wasn &apos;t , and so on .
so everything costs one token , but as you can see , sometimes tokens buy more than others , sometimes more grapes than others .
now , you &apos;re going to be deciding how you &apos;re going to lose money , but you &apos;re going to get the same choice .
this is all well and good , except that changes in different directions actually effect whether or not we think options are good or not .
and we started with the hope that maybe we can sort of tweak our financial institutions , tweak our technologies to make ourselves better .
in fact , they might be due to the very nature of our evolutionary history .
you can &apos;t just look at the dessert cart as say , &quot; No , no , no . that looks disgusting to me . &quot;
but we have to recognize that we have those limitations .
( Applause )
and the only way I can dive into that freezing cold water and swim a kilometer is by listening to my iPod and really rev@@ ving myself up , listening to everything from beautiful opera all the way across to Pu@@ ff Daddy , and then committing myself a hundred percent -- there is nothing more powerful than the made-@@ up mind -- and then walking up to the edge of the ice and just diving into the water .
I carried on for another five or six strokes , and then I had nothing in my body , and I went down to the bottom of the lake .
so I did it : I found out how many women had been raped en route to these camps .
so , the where : we &apos;ve identified 35 places globally that we need to work .
there must be a better way .
even working with individual companies is not probably going to get us there .
yes .
most of you , because the oceans are so cool .
that &apos;s less energy than we ever thought would be capable of supporting life , but somehow , amazingly , beautifully , it &apos;s enough .
I don &apos;t know .
the second effect is that , even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice , we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from .
one of them is , with a lot of different salad dress@@ ings to choose from , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what salad dressing is ? -- it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could &apos;ve made a different choice that would &apos;ve been better .
well , when there are lots of alternatives to consider , it &apos;s easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you &apos;ve chosen .
you will never be pleas@@ antly surprised , because your expectations , my expectations , have gone through the roof .
everybody needs a fish@@ bowl .
but I do hope to take you to some places you &apos;ve never been to before .
and , you know , it happens for several reasons .
it &apos;s a waste of resources if you don &apos;t use someone like D@@ ai Man@@ ju .
and that does not even include those that are trafficked within country borders , which is a substantial portion .
he does the transportation and distribution , and she does the production and sourcing .
a few yards away was a failed chicken co@@ op .
now , you notice he &apos;s sitting .
how do you skim stones ?
we would film that and air it , and then I could work with the local amateurs and write new comedy .
it really is his name .
and the Lebanese , brilliant Lebanese , Ne@@ m@@ r Ab@@ ou N@@ assa@@ r , we featured in our first tour , has just been performing in L.A. &apos; s legendary comedy clubs .
( Laughter ) Because I imagine the director : &quot; Ma@@ z , I think your character would rob the bank with a bomb around him . &quot;
and you see someone at C@@ V@@ S or -- not C@@ V@@ S -- like , Christian Di@@ or -- ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know . I don &apos;t have a black card ; I &apos;ve got a debit card .
( Laughter ) So , I &apos;ll label this for you in a second .
let me highlight it for you .
so there &apos;s a titan@@ ic amount of data out there now , unprecedented .
now this image constitutes a huge amount of work .
we scraped like 1,000 studies from Pu@@ b@@ M@@ ed , the biomedical database , and we compiled them and graded them all .
Do@@ osh ! again , the image re@@ creates itself .
yet , the ice of Antarctica is a calendar of climate change .
this process requires extraordinary precautions .
so , in the coldest place on Earth , they work inside a refrigerator .
Antarctica was this planet &apos;s last empty quarter -- the blind spot in our expanding vision of the world .
there &apos;s been a lot of folklore developed around the ocean , mostly negative .
I did another story on marine debris .
I couldn &apos;t fit them in .
and voila , next-@@ day air , they show up , and they surgically re@@ attach them .
we should study them with the same intensity that we study all the other important natural phenomena , like global warming , as we heard so eloquently last night from Al Gore .
whose clever move was it ?
and why the ant was doing it was because its brain had been infected with a lan@@ cet fluke that was needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow in order to reproduce .
that was just 10,000 years ago .
those are from &quot; The Pur@@ pose Dri@@ ven Life . &quot;
you &apos;ve all got a copy , and you &apos;ve just heard the man .
and the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water .
when the Pre@@ sti@@ ge sank off the coast of Spain , there were big , floating cushi@@ ons the size of sofa cushi@@ ons of emul@@ sified oil , with the consistency , or the visc@@ osity , of chewing gum .
they have a &quot; eureka ! &quot; moment , when we suddenly understand oil in a different context .
well , the reason is , is because , when we &apos;re buying gas , we &apos;re very invested in this sort of cognitive dissonance .
and here &apos;s one of the things that I@@ da Tar@@ bell said -- she said , &quot; He has a thin nose like a thor@@ n .
that was the beginning of an escalating U.S. involvement there that we do not pay for at the pump .
the mor@@ at@@ ori@@ ums are fine , but we do need to focus on the molecules on the oil .
my company developed an agricultural platform called i@@ C@@ ow .
okay , lots of you .
I think this film is one of the hardest watches of modern times , &quot; The Road . &quot;
this is somehow appealing to human greed instead of fear -- that more is better .
why are statisticians not measuring these ?
why don &apos;t we create a measure of progress that shows that ?
it &apos;s like quality and quantity of life in nations .
this is not the very distant future .
did we meet our three percent annual target on reducing carbon emissions ?
we &apos;re the first generation -- thanks to science -- to be informed that we may be undermining the stability and the ability of planet Earth to support human development as we know it .
and could we even define a planetary boundary , a fence , within which we then have a safe operating space for humanity ?
in the &apos; 50s , we start branching out .
but this gives a new paradigm to guide humanity , to put the light on our , so far over@@ powered industrial vehicle , which operates as if we &apos;re only on a dark , straight highway .
but of course , the drama is , it clearly shows that incremental change is not an option .
and my experience is that , when I &apos;m talking to her , with every second that passes during our conversation , the feeling of love that binds us is bringing us closer and closer together .
maybe we could look at that to be more similar to the falling of the Berlin Wall , where a divide that had kept two types of people apart had collapsed and opened up a door for further communication .
( Applause ) HH : Thank you very much .
hooked on being right .
and the list goes on .
and ineffective .
my father would comfort me with soft pat@@ s and kisses .
if you add up the deficits that all of the utilities run in Africa , sub-Saharan Africa , you get to a number of 21 billion dollars every year to maintain that system and keep it going .
it &apos;s a kit rather than a planetary thing , so a small solar system , and her small solar system allows her to have a couple of lightbulbs , and she &apos;s made this transition , this jump , from kerosene into light .
this is the kit that Susan has : four lightbulbs , radio , maybe a little flashlight , a little solar panel on the roof .
Thank you very much .
AI : and those prices are coming down very quickly .
I wanted to be part of a team that would help break down barriers and improve the lives of girls around the world .
the vehicle and everything inside are in a form of free fall around the Earth , and they don &apos;t experience the effect of gravity .
their bones and muscles weaken , and their cardiovascular system and their immune system change .
now this is something that I think is one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet .
it also happens to be male and , in theory immortal .
the location of this tree is actually kept secret for its own protection .
this is the cl@@ onal Cre@@ os@@ ote bush , which is around 12,000 years old .
( Applause )
so in 2006 , I bought myself a heavy over@@ coat and moved to Newcastle .
just say to them , &apos; That &apos;s cool . that &apos;s fantastic .
you can go to another group , peer over their shoulders , see what they &apos;re doing , come back to you own group and claim it as your own work . &quot;
again , &quot; In@@ ward Out . &quot;
will you help me to make this sculpture ? &quot;
and if they say they don &apos;t get it , that &apos;s also not true , because it &apos;s in the air .
this is the first day -- it just gives the appearance that one is becoming the other .
you can see the detail .
I was exhausted , and I was also disillusioned in a way I couldn &apos;t quite put my finger on .
a lot of my friends were still in it .
you &apos;ve got to institution@@ alize a system where you actually invite the Kosov@@ ars to come and tell you what they think .
and indeed , I think , rather than being annihil@@ ated , the performing arts are poised on the brink of a time when we will be more important than we have ever been .
that changes our climate .
because it &apos;s partly floating , you can imagine , is sea level rises a little bit , the ice lifts off the bed , and then it can break off and float north .
and that altern@@ ates with a sediment that looks like this .
you know , we &apos;ve warmed the globe about a degree C@@ enti@@ grade in the last century , and there &apos;s nothing in the natural part of that record that resembles what we &apos;ve seen in the last century .
and the first thing you need is ... a crowd , a group of people who share a common interest .
so , this possibility of a new type of global recognition , I think , is driving huge amounts of effort .
also , the system is self-@@ fueling .
the same trash site is feeding more than 30 families .
and thank you .
but what I &apos;d like to show you today is a means by which we might get not just rapid warning about an epidemic , but also actually early detection of an epidemic .
a kind of a diffusion of innovation could be understood and predicted by the mechanism I &apos;m going to show you now .
or you could see the first time the two curves diverged , as shown on the left .
when did the random@@ s -- when did the friends take off and leave the random@@ s , and &#91; when did &#93; their curve start shifting ?
and can you send me a bullet ? &quot;
you would be sharper and more alert .
now that &apos;s a great idea , but I &apos;d like to say that , in fact , this is a great metaphor for the way ideas happen .
and he recorded all these conversations and tried to figure out where the most important ideas happened .
( Laughter ) &quot; Could you just give me some time to do that ? &quot;
Thank you very much .
and so doctors and nurses -- they look up to them as experts .
even as we have more tests and more drugs , we can &apos;t reach people ; we don &apos;t have enough providers .
tas@@ k-@@ shifting is traditionally when you take health care services from one provider and have another provider do it .
so this is my S@@ IN@@ G Campaign .
I &apos;m sitting here in New York with Michel Si@@ di@@ be -- he &apos;s the director of UNAIDS .
and we didn &apos;t know when we left the hospital -- because we filmed her story -- we didn &apos;t know if she was going to survive .
I &apos;ve always wanted to be a mother .
seem like , I don &apos;t know what to do to raise my kids right and keep them alive .
it can tell you by its weight , &quot; OK , move right . walk ahead . make a left here . &quot;
men typically listen reduc@@ tively .
the trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear is noise , surrounding us all the time .
we may be raising an entire generation of deaf people .
if you can &apos;t hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice , it &apos;s too loud .
there are great things being done there , treating now autism , dementia and other conditions .
( Laughter ) I am my connectome .
if we continue through the entire stack , we can reconstruct the three-dimensional shape of a small fragment of a branch of a neuron .
should we ridicule the modern seekers of immortality , calling them fools ?
somebody has to feel how you felt .
we developed a cul@@ tur@@ ally-@@ sensitive psycho-social counseling approach .
we revised the mental health component of the primary health care services by adding psycho-social care and psycho-social counselors to the system .
and doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients , but now this will change .
the first one is Jim Wright .
most of them have Kor@@ sa@@ koff syndrome , a poly@@ neu@@ ri@@ tic psychosis .
all I want you to do is rank these for me , from the one you like the most to the one you like the least . &quot;
they &apos;re not just saying it because they own it , because they don &apos;t know they own it .
but freedom to choose , to change and make up your mind , is the enemy of synthetic happiness , and I &apos;m going to show you why .
now , there are two conditions in this experiment .
and we didn &apos;t need a big organization to run it -- it was run by the villagers themselves .
stop global warming ; use condoms .
everybody joins in , and they feel they own the bank , because they have brought the money in .
biological yield is really important .
it &apos;s a dilemma , a dilemma of growth .
but shouldn &apos;t we just check first that the economic system that we have is remotely capable of delivering this kind of improvement ?
I just want to highlight one key feature of this system , which is the role of investment .
it has to be about transition .
( Laughter ) Can you picture the politicians ever buying into this ?
you can see in its shape and its streamlined design it &apos;s powered for ocean swimming .
some of you may be guilty of having contributed to the demise of bluefin .
these elephant seals cover half an ocean , take data down to 1,800 feet -- amazing data .
they &apos;re carrying instruments that are actually taking data down to 2,000 meters .
they had low child mortality and small families .
they byp@@ assed Sweden five years ago , and they are labeled a developing country .
we have to have a modern concept , which fits to the data .
you &apos;ll be challenged , inspired , motivated and humbled .
we have the animals that are able to live and to sense , and on the top of the pyramid , there is the man .
but it &apos;s something completely wrong .
let &apos;s have a look at this short movie now .
these are young sun@@ flowers , and what they are doing cannot be described with any other terms than playing .
but some plants are manipulating animals , like in the case of orchids that promise sex and nectar and give in change nothing for the transportation of the pollen .
they work in the same way .
and before I finish , I would like to reassure that no snails were harmed in making this presentation .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s just elementary probability theory .
80 to 90 percent of their time was spent on five things .
so all of those -- what &apos;s common about all of those ?
because , many of you will know , that the biggest pollution burden that we have on the New York , New Jersey harbor right now is no longer the point sources , no longer the big pollu@@ ters , no longer the G@@ E@@ s , but that massive network of roads , &#91; those &#93; imper@@ vious surfaces , that collect all that ca@@ d@@ mi@@ um neuro@@ toxin that comes from your brake lin@@ ers or the oily hydro@@ carbon waste in every single storm event and medieval infrastructure washes it straight into the e@@ stu@@ ary system .
these are little opportunities to intercept those pollutants before they enter the harbor , and they &apos;re produced by impati@@ ents on various city blocks in some very interesting ways .
what the climate crisis has revealed to us is a secondary , more insidious and more pervasive crisis , which is the crisis of agency , which is what to do .
life-@@ giving .
when I was told that I would go to hell because I was not Christian , called a &quot; black dog &quot; because I was not white , I ran to my grandfather &apos;s arms .
and there will be moments when I cannot protect him when he is seen as a terrorist ...
and people started laying bread in tribute , and eventually a team was able to do it between New Zealand and Spain .
and what happened was I was sent this piece of audio and had no idea who generated the audio .
and so I flew to St. Louis and met Ray , and he &apos;s a preacher -- ( Laughter ) among other things .
when they smile -- right , you &apos;ve seen people stop -- all of a sudden , life is being lived there , somewhere up in that weird , dense network .
and I also was taught , coupled with that , that it was my job -- this classroom full of five and six year-old children -- it was our job , apparently , to help .
and we allow entrepreneurs to share a percentage of their revenues .
and that -- forget the tools , forget the moving around of resources -- that stuff &apos;s easy .
so let &apos;s make a little test .
I would say , we should call ourselves coc@@ tiv@@ ors -- ( Laughter ) from co@@ qu@@ ere , to cook .
so this ingenuity of our ancestors , to invent this most marvelous technology .
the lower layer , our gut brain , has its own goals -- digestion defense -- and we have the higher brain with the goal of integration and generating behaviors .
now everyone would expect that when the degradation of the oil happens , when the constituents are liberated , they disappear , they go away because they &#91; were &#93; absorbed .
in the United States , less than seven percent of our plastics are recycled .
this was so sick@@ ening ; people died because of cartoons .
this is the future of journalism , I think .
so back in Abi@@ d@@ jan , I was given a chance to lead a workshop with local cartoonists there and I thought , yes , in a context like this , cartoons can really be used as weapons against the other side .
we brought together cartoonists from all sides in Ivory Coast .
&quot; no ... not at all . &quot;
if you &apos;re sitting in Japan , or in New Delhi , or in Han@@ o@@ i , your view of the rise of China is a little different than if you &apos;re sitting in Beijing .
they got more calories over the course of a diver@@ sified meal .
we need to sav@@ or vegetables .
we tend to think that science is all about facts and logic and human feelings are often neglected or considered an obstacle to get rid of .
but I say we should not be afraid of using our feelings to implement and to catalyze fac@@ t-based science and innovation .
and what is the natural enemy , the biological control agent , or the &quot; good bug &quot; that we &apos;re talking about ?
and here you can see this parasite in action , like in an ac@@ ro@@ ba@@ tic maneuver .
as time passes , people spend their income in different ways , changing how they spread it across existing goods , and developing tastes for entirely new goods , too .
and yet today , all of these tasks can be automated .
and go back to those three cases that I mentioned at the start .
and these things are very difficult to articulate , and so it was thought these tasks would be very hard to automate .
let me say now why I think actually this is a good problem to have .
those economic pies have exploded in size .
solving this problem is going to require us to think in very different ways .
and the way they do this is through a combination of probability and data .
it &apos;s very hard to learn , to feel a lesson .
in reward terms , it &apos;s not money ; it &apos;s not being given cash -- that &apos;s nice -- it &apos;s doing stuff with our peers , watching us , collaborating with us .
we all understand why we have elections , and we all leave the house on the same day to go and vote .
they trust that election workers and election observers do their jobs and do their jobs correctly .
and sometimes we even have to trust computers .
instead , we want to make the whole process so transparent that news media and international observers and anyone who wants to can download all the election data and do the count themselves .
and you can see that it kind of hockey sticks up around the 1960s and &apos; 70s , and it &apos;s on kind of a nice trajectory right now .
suddenly , I saw a world that I had never seen before in the ocean -- schools of fish that were so dense they dul@@ led the penetration of sunlight from the surface , coral reefs that were continuous and solid and colorful , large fish everywhere , manta rays .
it is a paradigm shift from treating people once they have become sick to preserving the health of the healthy before they get sick .
if the individual becomes sick , the insurance company will not receive any further monetary compensation for the medical interventions required to treat the disease of that individual , but they would be obliged to pay for every evidence-based treatment option to return the customer back to health .
it &apos;s lightweight ...
it will take several more years to get to mass adoption , but we are at the edge of commercialization , meaning there are several companies out there with production lines .
but from a mathematical point of view , a qualitatively same system of predat@@ or-@@ prey type equations will describe interactions between foxes and rabbits and cancer and immune cells .
that one of the best ways to extingu@@ ish species is not to target them directly but to target their environment .
and so , once we have identified the key components of the tumor environment , we can propose hypotheses and simulate scenarios and therapeutic interventions all in a completely safe and affordable way and target different components of the micro@@ environment in such a way as to kill the cancer without harming the host , such as me or you .
( Laughter ) That day , my entire mathematical world came crashing down on me .
but mathematics is a source of truth , please don &apos;t go abstract on me .
but once the excitement settled down , there were a few concerns that cre@@ pt in our minds .
there is a reason we keep going down one rabbit hole after another , even when we know it &apos;s going to make us feel worse .
it &apos;s a fight , and your reason is your strongest weapon .
they introduced each other to their adult children after one month , and they moved in together after two .
( Laughter ) But that &apos;s not very good for the company and not very good for anyone who has different ideas .
promoting the guy who didn &apos;t finish high school was a risk .
