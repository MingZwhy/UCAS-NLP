and it &apos;s truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice ; I &apos;m extremely grateful .
( Laughter ) It was din@@ ner@@ time , and we started looking for a place to eat .
most of these expend@@ itures are also profitable .
so in this situation too , to decode the information contained in patterns like this , watching alone won &apos;t do .
in other words , instead of recording the activity of neurons , we need to control it .
Gal@@ van@@ i &apos;s approach of probing the nervous system with electrodes has remained state-of-the-art until today , despite a number of draw@@ backs .
so instead of inserting a wire into one spot of the brain , re-@@ engineer the brain itself so that some of its neural elements become responsive to diff@@ usely broadcast signals such as a flash of light .
I hope you &apos;ll appreciate the beautiful simplicity of this concept .
but these pores here are special .
each chamber in these two vertical stacks contains one fly .
I want to debut a new song that I &apos;ve been working on in the last five or six months .
because although I &apos;ve used scientific terms in songs , it &apos;s very difficult sometimes to make them lyri@@ cal .
so this is Bertie County , North Carolina , USA .
it &apos;s down@@ towns becoming ghost towns .
I have strategically cut Matt &apos;s head out of this photo , because he would kill me if he knew I was using it because of the sweat@@ suits .
he is 16 years old , loves hunting and fishing and being outside and doing anything with his hands , and so for him , Studio H means that he can stay interested in his education through that hands-on engagement .
in Ky@@ r@@ gy@@ z@@ stan , just over the last few weeks , unprecedented levels of violence occurred between ethnic Ky@@ r@@ gy@@ z and ethnic U@@ z@@ be@@ ks .
if there &apos;s no solution on the battlefield , three factors can account for the prevention of ethnic conflict and civil war , or for sustainable peace afterwards : leadership , diplomacy and institutional design .
a cold war is not as good as a cold peace , but a cold peace is still better than a hot war .
conflict parties need to move away from maximum demands and towards a compromise that recognizes each other &apos;s needs .
we appropri@@ ated land for trails and trains to shortcut through the heart of the Lakota Nation .
it &apos;s crazy .
but there are companies .
did it answer the question ?
and I think there are some cases .
this one kind of anno@@ ys me , I must say .
and you know if you walk across a chasm , you end up making it worse than if you didn &apos;t start at all -- bigger disaster .
they go back about two-@@ and-a-half-@@ million years .
so we had a lot of this going on .
so he crashes down , and he gets slightly injured , but this does not prevent him from jumping up and then starting to jump up and down on his bike and curse violently .
and I would say , &quot; Rel@@ ax , Alex .
together with the kids , I also went through a remarkable transformation .
it literally prop@@ els you upwards .
it &apos;s very cold , and you &apos;re standing in one of these rainy days , and it &apos;s dri@@ zzling and cold and chil@@ ly , and you &apos;re standing in , let &apos;s say , Y@@ ok@@ ne@@ am .
and you look down at Y@@ ok@@ ne@@ am ; everything is so small and tiny .
we walked 120 kilometers until we reached Sudan .
I had a really hard time in school .
it ruined my life -- ( Laughter ) &quot; The In@@ convenient Truth &quot; and Mr. Gore .
we had had a wonderful life there , and we decided to do something unusual .
we pay the bill at the end of the month , but the people that are really going to pay the bill are our grandchildren .
the first one was called san@@ ding and the second one was called re-@@ wa@@ xing .
this is the school buffalo .
that is , we &apos;re able to save it from a fate of deep-sea bottom trawling .
but there has just been a study that was released in February that showed there are 200,000 pieces of plastic per square-@@ kilometer now floating in the surface of the Sar@@ gas@@ so Sea , and that is affecting the habitat for the many species in their juvenile stages who come to the Sar@@ gas@@ so Sea for its protection and its food .
which leads me to my second passion besides ocean science , which is outer space technology .
( Laughter ) Water wings -- an inch of water .
&#91; con@@ cus@@ sive Force &#93; &quot; Star@@ sky and Hut@@ ch &quot; ? arguably , yes .
this is a great resource for student athletes , teachers , parents , professionals , athletic and coaching staff .
( Laughter ) So ...
I thought it was just like the movies , but the movies had not conve@@ yed them in the powerful image that I was seeing full of bright red and orange and gray , and a full circle of explosion .
and I kept on staring at it until it disappeared .
it is very scary to go through that feeling of &quot; I am about to die &quot; or &quot; I could die in this explosion . &quot;
she learned about her rights .
Thank you .
I &apos;ll hear things like an extra room in the house , the basement , the coffee shop , the library .
and what ends up happening -- you might have days like this where you wake up at eight or seven in the morning , or whenever you get up , and you &apos;re like , &quot; I didn &apos;t sleep very well .
we all have to improve on this sort of thing .
you find a lot of other distractions , but not managers and meetings .
all these discussions and decisions you thought you had to make at this one time at 9 a.m. on Monday , just forget about them , and things will be fine .
I got that staircase for 20 dollars , including delivery to my lot .
it only ratt@@ les that expected pattern and unity of structural features .
everybody points and laughs , and they say , &quot; He tried it a fifth time , and it still didn &apos;t work !
I want you to know that there are farmers &apos; markets in every community popping up .
they had one camel left over .
well , that system is , I think , probably the system that kept us alive to this point , given our human tendencies .
and this woman right here , U@@ m Ah@@ mad , is a woman who lives on the path in Northern Jordan .
and there is no ideology that will tell you where your property ends .
the reason why this is important , is in 10 years , another thing is going to happen beyond drones and self-driving cars , but you &apos;re going to see the most valuable economy in the world -- the largest economy in the world -- is going to be a country run by communi@@ sts .
more than 1,000 species -- an enormous variety .
but it &apos;s increasing enormously .
and even in terms of calories , it is very good .
first of all , we associate the click sound with a food reward , which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe .
so what we did is we collected some samples -- just as a way of testing -- from hospitals , trained rats on them and see if this works , and wonder , well , we can reach 89 percent sensitivity , 86 percent specificity using multiple rats in a row .
it gets a click sound and comes for the food reward .
can you imagine the potential offspring applications -- environmental detection of pollutants in soils , customs applications , detection of illicit goods in containers and so on .
or my favorite ...
and they learned that they didn &apos;t need us to tell them how or when or even why to protest .
they think , &quot; No , there can &apos;t be any sort of natur@@ alistic explanation of consciousness . &quot;
he says , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s not my department , I &apos;m sorry . &quot;
the brain just makes you think that it &apos;s got the detail there .
but the details of the process are still in significant controversy .
it &apos;s then distributed , and distribution is a massive issue .
we put them in bottles , refriger@@ ate them , and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again .
it serves 2@@ 20 people a day .
I started meditating on that and created a restaurant called Water@@ house .
( Laughter ) It was perfect for me .
so basically , I got ...
former Philadelphia E@@ ag@@ les strong safety , &#91; 44 &#93; years old , a Division II football coach when he decided to put a gun to his head .
but if you do get the permission of his next of kin , I will release the brain to you . &quot;
it just had not been studied formally .
and it started with , actually , a hockey player in 2009 .
and so now , I &apos;m very much focused on what can we do to actually treat this disease ?
migration is usually a young person &apos;s endeavor .
those older people were not going to be able to make the crossing with them .
remember , pu@@ tatively free American citizens .
and that is just to walk into a library and take out a library book .
rain .
where on earth are you going to experience that in a study book ?
( Applause ) Einstein said that this was the definition of insanity -- to do the same things over and over again , hoping for a different outcome .
that &apos;s how we change the world . that &apos;s the only sustainable future .
sit down , get yourself together and come back and talk to me when you can talk to me like a -- &quot; what ?
but I knew I felt bad about what was happening .
Thank you folks .
they just get the school which parents choose for them .
but that response comes out of those 90 points .
these are hundreds of classes .
and now look at this second set of slides .
or that we require kids to sit still too much , and so boys initially feel like failures ?
and the other reason it &apos;s kind of urgent is because it &apos;s not just happening in the U.S .
and sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child so they could have a male child .
for one thing , it puts men and women in a really ant@@ agon@@ istic relationship with one another , because the men are these devi@@ ous trick@@ sters up there who &apos;ve put up this glass ceiling .
and I put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves .
and they &apos;re like , &quot; Oh , that one wasn &apos;t so awesome . &quot;
I want you to look at your friend a little bit .
are they of the same nationality as you ?
I want you to think about how you think about this ticket that you have to travel your social universe .
RG : you may remember , we fell head over heels in love .
we were desp@@ on@@ dent .
it can &apos;t possibly be that bad .
it &apos;s a bad idea . don &apos;t do it . &quot;
one of my guiding principles is that by helping computers to understand what it &apos;s like to have these experiences , to understand what we share and believe and feel , then we &apos;re in a great position to start evolving computer technology in a way that &apos;s complementary with our own experiences .
and there you already see a light shining on what the future holds .
technology that works regardless of your demographics or the color of your skin .
so I will now show you a short movie showing this manipulation .
PJ : so they get the opposite of their choice .
PJ : you like the smir@@ ky look better ?
woman 2 : no , I did not notice that .
so the next experiment , it needs a little bit of a background .
&quot; like in the newspaper today , it said they can like , listen to mobile phones from prison , if a gang leader tries to continue his crimes from inside .
so , if you didn &apos;t know that this person just took part in a choice blindness experiment , I don &apos;t think you would question that this is the true attitude of that person .
so this may all seem a bit disturbing .
so you get long-lasting increases in those good mood neurotransmitters .
so , ku@@ fun@@ gi@@ si@@ sa is the local equivalent of depression in my country .
and we assumed that that would take about a week .
and -- ( Laughter ) And they don &apos;t leave their communities in search of greener pastures .
my father , a mechanic by profession , worked very hard to send me to school .
and simply , if we can &apos;t protect them , we &apos;re going to have a job protecting ourselves as well .
so the question is , what is the first question for designers ?
so , as Kevin Kelly pointed out , there is no endgame .
so designers all over the world can analyze their products down to the parts per million for human and ecological health .
we &apos;ve lifted the earth up onto the roofs .
yeah .
and so you have to understand that I have a bachelor &apos;s and a master &apos;s in social work , and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work , so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the &quot; life &apos;s messy , love it . &quot;
no one wants to talk about it , and the less you talk about it , the more you have it .
my one year turned into six years : thousands of stories , hundreds of long interviews , focus groups .
let me tell you something : you know who you are when you call your friends and say , &quot; I think I need to see somebody .
and you know how there are people that , when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important , that they surrender and walk into it .
I &apos;m going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin .
that &apos;s it .
you need to have incentives .
I will say though that , after having done surgery a lot , it &apos;s similar to playing a musical instrument .
but she asked me a question : how confident was I that I would find a tumor early on her mammogram if she developed one ?
our manuscript was then accepted and will be published later this month in the journal Radi@@ ology .
we grew up , and we grew older .
( Laughter ) And this non-profit group had a big welcoming lunch for all the new immigrants to Canada .
we are the only species on the only life-@@ giving rock in the entire universe that we &apos;ve ever seen , capable of experiencing so many of these things .
we &apos;ve got books , buff@@ ets and radio waves , wedding bri@@ des and rollercoaster rides .
it is stopping the tar sands .
it &apos;s hard work every day .
this is work going on down in lower Manhattan where they built some of the first electric power generating stations .
now , not all these things were highly successful .
well , what &apos;s happening is that we &apos;ve suddenly found a new species .
and of course , it wasn &apos;t actually a working mine anymore , because , though Ray was a miner there , the mine had closed and had been re@@ opened as a kind of tourist attraction , because , of course , it can &apos;t compete on the scale of operations which are happening in South America , Australia , wherever .
&quot; this , &quot; he wrote , &quot; is the interrelated structure of reality . &quot;
I &apos;m calling my initiative &quot; Take the Other to Lunch . &quot;
so the point here is that not all boys exist within these rigid boundaries of what we think of as boys and girls , and not all girls exist within those rigid boundaries of what we think of as girls .
in fact , what we ought to do is take a page from their playbook , because the initiatives and programs that have been set in place for women in science and engineering and mathematics are fantastic .
&quot; well , what do you want to write ?
third reason that boys are out of sync with school today : kindergarten is the old second grade , folks .
we need to talk to teachers and parents and school board members and politicians .
I just did something I &apos;ve never done before .
let &apos;s hear from Tony Hay@@ ward again .
it is this underlying assumption of limit@@ lessness that makes it possible to take the reckless risks that we do .
thankfully , I met R@@ eda Gir@@ gis , who is dry as toast , but he and his team at Johns Hopkins didn &apos;t just want me to survive , they wanted me to live a meaningful life .
mine was 14@@ 6 .
I was on a dozen machines that were keeping me alive .
the cheapest products are often the most dangerous .
but what we don &apos;t understand is -- here we are in Los Angeles .
and it &apos;s the idea that we don &apos;t have disposable anything .
( Laughter ) &quot; I &apos;m so clever ! &quot;
and I &apos;ve taken the liberty , just for clarity , to translate that to data slices .
and this women also ended up under the car , so she &apos;s quite badly beaten up by this injury .
you can also see some of the artifacts from the teeth -- that &apos;s actually the filling of the teeth -- but because I &apos;ve set the functions to show me metal and make everything else transparent .
so it gained some traction , and we &apos;re trying to roll this out and trying to use it for educational purposes , but also , perhaps in the future , in a more clinical situation .
so we &apos;ve got motor cortex activation up there .
so , some very talented people .
( Applause ) You &apos;ve been a great audience .
the post-@@ crisis projection is 2020 .
and what does it mean ?
Christ , the Chinese even invented golf .
I &apos;m going to be talking to you about how we can tap a really underutilized resource in health care , which is the patient , or , as I like to use the scientific term , people .
that was the message . that was the experiment .
it &apos;s a difficult and expensive commodity , until now .
God forbid we should use that same standard that we make Cap &apos;@@ n Crunch live by and bring it to drug companies .
it isn &apos;t this kind of vague promise that it &apos;s going to work no matter what , but you get the statistics for how effective it is .
( Laughter ) There were plenty of role models all around us .
she was a hom@@ emaker , but she and I didn &apos;t go out and do gir@@ lie things together , and she didn &apos;t buy me pink outfits .
I broke my left fe@@ mur that day -- it &apos;s the largest bone in your body -- and spent the next two months in a body cast that went from my chin to the tip of my toe to my right knee , and a steel bar went from my right knee to my left ankle .
would they wonder who I was , I thought .
she &apos;s a very upbeat , naturally excited person .
I was like , &quot; C@@ ow tipping ?
and then in the 1980 &apos;s , they determined that one particular cocktail of chemo could be effective , and within weeks I had started that regi@@ men .
as I became less and less human -- and at this moment in my life , I was probably 30 pounds less than I am right now .
he said , &quot; I would tell them what I know , and that is everybody dies , but not everybody lives .
if you look here at this map , showing everything in blue is out in the water , and everything in yellow is u@@ pl@@ and .
( Laughter ) So in the studio , rather than drawing , we began to learn how to knit .
this is an image of high school students , scuba divers that we worked with on our team .
so rather than having 10 oysters , you have 10,000 oysters .
we use words like &quot; grasp &quot; metaphorically to also think about understanding things .
but he &apos;s trying to power it , or motor@@ ize it , with a drill .
this particular re@@ el -- it &apos;s an industrial video -- but it was shown in drive-@@ in theaters in 1961 -- in the Detroit area , in fact -- and it preceded Alfred H@@ itch@@ cock &apos;s &quot; Psy@@ cho . &quot;
they &apos;re playing to discover what the technology can do , and probably to discover what they can do themselves , what their own capabilities are .
why should I know this ?
JS : because what ? HS : I &apos;m gonna get &apos; em .
now , this is when something really bizarre happens .
for some reason , you guys are just really slow .
( Laughter ) Now , I &apos;ve been to a lot of marathons , and I &apos;ve yet to see any ...
he pissed me off . let him go chase his own ant@@ elope . &quot;
why do we keep getting hurt ?
but maybe there &apos;s another benefit there as well .
poetry does that .
but my head un@@ wraps around what appears limitless , man &apos;s creative violence .
one woman loses six .
one woman loses her head .
if you must , fear the unexp@@ lo@@ ded .
SK : or even the idea that the ni@@ pple deserves the same treatment that a DJ gives his deck when he &apos;s trying to turn up the volume .
I once challenged friends to simply go into supermarkets and say to strangers , &quot; T@@ highs . &quot;
SK : and we &apos;re going to talk about one in particular that &apos;s named &quot; os@@ un@@ ality . &quot;
coming from a history of sexual violence , slavery and a lack of bodily autonomy .
if you don &apos;t design your life , someone else will design it for you , and you may just not like their idea of balance .
now I &apos;m not talking here just about the bad companies -- the &quot; ab@@ at@@ to@@ irs of the human soul , &quot; as I call them .
do another three hours &apos; work .
and so that year , I started to build this robot , Kismet , the world &apos;s first social robot .
we try Skype , we try phone calls , but my boys are little -- they don &apos;t really want to talk ; they want to play .
you &apos;d use a screen interface to enter information , like how many calories you ate that day , how much exercise you got .
and so I have a new project in my group I wanted to present to you today called Play@@ time Compu@@ ting that &apos;s really trying to think about how we can take what &apos;s so engaging about digital media and literally bring it off the screen into the real world of the child , where it can take on many of the properties of real-world play .
and as you can see , it &apos;s the women who are carrying the children ; it &apos;s the women who come into the hospitals ; it &apos;s the women &#91; are &#93; building the houses .
first rule : there is no clan distinguished and political division in Somali society .
then my father allowed me to proceed &#91; with &#93; my hope .
these are spin@@ ner@@ et glands on the abdomen of a spider .
secondly , shifting from a linear , wasteful , polluting way of using resources to a closed-@@ loop model .
and just for fun , we &apos;ve proposed this for a round@@ about in central London , which at the moment is a complete ey@@ es@@ ore .
so returning to those big challenges that I mentioned at the beginning : radical increases in resource efficiency , closing loops and a solar economy .
&quot; don &apos;t ignore me , &quot; it screamed .
( Laughter ) FB : we met at the Nu@@ y@@ ori@@ can Po@@ ets C@@ af@@ é in 1999 .
I swear we are never going to be friends .
JM : while you &apos;re home having flash@@ backs to 9 / 11 , listening to the last call of your friend , a firefighter who perished in the North Tower .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m so used to that .
and so what I &apos;d like to do this morning for the next few minutes is perform a linguistic resurrection .
and Matthew has made this remarkable observation that I &apos;m just going to offer you and let it sit .
compassion is rarely a solution , but it is always a sign of a deeper reality , of deeper human possibilities .
and Einstein fore@@ saw that as we grow more modern and technologically advanced , we need the virtues our traditions carry forward in time more , not less .
just as the poets and writers described , we &apos;re going to be able to see , I think , that wondrous openness , utter and complete openness , of the mind of a child .
( Laughter ) I was bullied quite a bit .
this is also what fashion can do .
with every handful of the powder they throw into the air , their white sar@@ is slowly start to suff@@ use with color .
and this we can say without a single word .
wear it like armor .
and I have learned that power , particularly in its absolute form , is an equal opportunity provider .
one of the Acumen Fund fellows at my organization , Sur@@ a@@ j Sud@@ ha@@ kar , has what we call moral imagination -- the ability to put yourself in another person &apos;s shoes and lead from that perspective .
and it &apos;s starting to look at -- not always and not for everything -- but in certain moments of time , access to certain kinds of goods and service will tru@@ mp ownership of them .
and as I think about the mesh and I think about , well , what &apos;s driving it , how come it &apos;s happening now , I think there &apos;s a number of vectors that I want to give you as background .
how many people here have experienced car-sharing or bi@@ ke-@@ sharing ?
because we give them so much information , and they are entitled to really see how it is that we &apos;re moving .
because I don &apos;t think any of us in this room could have predicted the sorts of applications that have happened at Facebook , around Facebook , for example , two years ago , when Mark announced that they were going to go with a platform .
and I said , &quot; Well I &apos;ve been a woman for 60 years , but I &apos;ve only been Secretary of State for a few minutes . &quot;
the bottom line that I decided was actually women &apos;s issues are the hardest issues , because they are the ones that have to do with life and death in so many aspects , and because , as I said , it is really central to the way that we think about things .
because one of the things I think you &apos;ll understand .
and what all this means is that paradigms take far too long to shift , that complexity and nuance are ignored and also that money talks -- because we &apos;ve all seen the evidence of pharmaceutical companies funding studies of drugs that conveniently leave out their worst side effects , or studies funded by food companies of their new products , massively exaggerating the health benefits of the products they &apos;re about to bring by market .
A@@ lo@@ ha . K@@ onic@@ hi@@ wa . Shal@@ om . A@@ h-@@ Sal@@ am Ala@@ ik@@ um .
it &apos;s where our senses are located , our special senses -- our vision , our speech , our hearing , our smell , our taste .
they &apos;ve grown used to their face ; they think they &apos;re special .
and so they want to see live witnesses .
the face transplant has a role probably in burns patients to replace the skin .
otherwise , people might step over the sensor .
&quot; no , Mom , they didn &apos;t hit him . &quot;
I was on G@@ rin@@ d@@ r until I found out it wasn &apos;t a sandwich app .
OK ?
and when you couple that with im@@ plan@@ table hardware , you are looking at the next incarnation of human evolution .
and all of that sounds great , until you figure out where it &apos;s really going .
as a child , I was raised by native Hawaiian elders -- three old women who took care of me while my parents worked .
we &apos;re connected 24 / 7 , yet anxiety , fear , depression and loneliness is at an all-time high .
the link between the past and the future is fragile .
and so this picture , which looks like a big smu@@ dge to you , is actually the thing that got me really thrilled about this and made me feel like we were on the right track .
so what we do with this is , for example , we can look at two patients , one that responded to a drug and one that didn &apos;t respond to a drug , and ask , &quot; What &apos;s going on differently inside of them ? &quot;
the thing about cancer -- when I got into this , I really knew nothing about it , but working with David Ag@@ us , I started watching how cancer was actually being treated and went to operations where it was being cut out .
and so I gave this talk and said , &quot; Why don &apos;t you guys do this ? &quot;
she observes , she notes small , everyday injustices faced by women and girls in her village .
now they started to understand the importance of education .
Thank you .
these regimes created something within us during this period .
I &apos;m 43 years old right now .
the intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people .
the stability and security of authoritarian regimes cannot create but terrorism and violence and destruction .
but with that lens , you have to be as close as 10 inches from the person .
in the Middle East , I experienced my work in places without &#91; many &#93; museums .
when we act together , the whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts .
because everyone was a hero .
platforms like YouTube , Twitter , Facebook were helping us a lot because it basically gave us the impression that , &quot; Wow , I &apos;m not alone .
I was not allowed to speak with anyone .
now how did we get here ?
so what do we need to do ?
but if I were to point to three challenges , the first one is actually the design of materials that could go in your body and do well over time .
these are actually cells that we obtained .
we use now some type of technologies , where for solid organs , for example , like the liver , what we do is we take discard livers .
and we then can re-@@ perf@@ use the liver with cells , preserving the blood vessel tree .
so while we &apos;ve been talking today , you can actually see the printer back here in the back stage .
xenophobia &apos;s on the rise . the trafficking of women and girls .
I wrote the book I needed to read .
it &apos;s almost like you can see them learning over those last 10 problems .
( Laughter ) BG : so fif@@ th-grade math is where that &apos;s going on right now ?
we &apos;ve got a million people on the site already , so we can handle a few more .
Google &apos;s doing it too .
what they discovered was that in our Netflix queues there &apos;s this epic struggle going on between our future aspirational selves and our more impulsive present selves .
and instead of a balanced information diet , you can end up surrounded by information junk food .
I know that there are a lot of people here from Facebook and from Google -- Larry and Sergey -- people who have helped build the Web as it is , and I &apos;m grateful for that .
this is my wife and collaborator , R@@ up@@ al .
no video here , so you can focus on the sound , the acoustics , of a new kind of trajectory : Gaga to water .
and so we started to analyze why .
( Applause )
well , it started back in the late 1800s when people started settling in places like Montana .
( Laughter ) and some of you &apos;ll be happy to know that it involves beer .
now the bre@@ wers in Montana have already done a lot to reduce their water consumption , but they still use millions of gallons of water .
( Laughter ) They buy these sea@@ wee@@ d-@@ based snacks there called V@@ eg@@ gie Bo@@ ot@@ y with K@@ ale , which is for kids who come home and say , &quot; Mom , mom , I want a snack that &apos;ll help prevent col@@ on-@@ rectal cancer . &quot;
( Laughter ) And so the kids are raised in a certain way , jumping through achievement hoops of the things we can measure -- SAT prep , o@@ bo@@ e , soccer practice .
we &apos;re social animals , not rational animals .
and H@@ of@@ stad@@ ter wrote a book called &quot; I Am a S@@ tran@@ ge L@@ oop . &quot;
and he was reading Einstein &apos;s recently published general theory of relativity , and he was thrilled by this theory .
it shows two black holes in orbit around each other , again , with these help@@ fully painted curves .
but they &apos;re not frozen ; they &apos;re actually merging .
when that expression was coined , it was deri@@ sive -- like , &quot; Oh , who would believe in a Big Bang ? &quot;
but we have to ask : is it possible that our universe is just a plu@@ me off of some greater history ?
and if they are , I can imagine them as we are , calculating , writing computer code , building instruments , trying to detect that fa@@ int@@ est sound of their origins and wondering who else is out there .
he said , &quot; Bezos , I need you to go into the house .
and you know what I &apos;ve learned ?
that was , of course , by Le Cor@@ bus@@ ier , the famous architect .
he meant something like this -- where the light gives direction to the space and helps you to get around .
how do they share their culture ?
and to find a starry sky like this is even more difficult .
and we discovered that when we make those lights green , the birds , they actually go the right way .
I think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled in intellectual performance is one called A@@ i in Japan -- her name means love -- and she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her .
and because it seems that these patterns are passed from one generation to the next , through observation , imitation and practice -- that is a definition of human culture .
then , you see , it is a message of hope .
we want to clear away the toxic soil from this area and have an organic garden .
who I &apos;ve got over .
that was how I felt two years ago .
and they live below the poverty line .
once they could do that with cells , they could do it with organisms .
the gu@@ ar is an endangered Southeast Asian ung@@ ulate .
I &apos;ll get back to that in a minute .
this is a brain from a lamp@@ rey eel .
I want you now to imagine a wearable robot that gives you superhuman abilities , or another one that takes wheelchair users up standing and walking again .
( Applause ) EB : as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to sit down and have discussions with you .
in August 2007 , Clar@@ on was awarded the Amsterdam Prize for the Arts , winning praise for her brilliance , her amazing and extensively wide repertoire and her vivid stage personality .
and these little dots , these represent a sort of sound that &apos;s not a vocal , not a lyri@@ cal way of expressing the voice .
how long are you staying ? &quot;
and one fine day , she decided to take them into the garden to teach them some nature vocabulary .
I love it that we have a global language .
and I phoned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their expertise with what we found in code and data .
so it &apos;s just like from the Hollywood movies where during the he@@ ist , the observation camera is fed with pr@@ erec@@ orded video .
AK : it had to have a rider , and it had to participate in cavalry charges .
we were going to te@@ st-@@ drive it on the street outside of our house in Cape Town , and it got to midnight and we hadn &apos;t done that yet .
here I have an 18-@@ second clip of the very first walk of the prototype .
when they point right back , the horse is fearful or angry , depending upon what &apos;s going on in front of him , around him .
again , that was a practical consideration .
and it wasn &apos;t just any hill : it was a 15-@@ mile climb up to a town called Haw@@ i on the Big Island of Hawaii .
I remember wanting so badly to be able to compete , but I couldn &apos;t .
here , I was quoting from the grand , Phara@@ onic African cultures of the Nile Valley civilizations ; namely , Egypt , Sudan and Ethiopia , so as to imbu@@ e her with a st@@ ately , ironic , calm grandeur .
Alex@@ x E@@ ku@@ bo is a sharp study in simplified elegance and dignity and a harmony in blue and white , as well .
that &apos;s what I felt when I designed and organized the portrait .
and I said , &quot; Yes , I would love to do that . it sounds great . &quot;
and the second is that people seem to be experiencing an actual connection .
there &apos;s an effect on you and on your leaders .
and you have to watch and take care of each other .
the first example is the largest annual community event -- where Googl@@ ers from around the world donate their labor to their local communities -- was initiated and organized by three employees before it became official , because it just became too big .
it was two persons saying , &quot; Let &apos;s do this , &quot; and the company said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
it means being able to observe our thought stream and the process of emotion with high clarity , objectivity and from a third-@@ person perspective .
X@@ K : do you have a perspective -- I don &apos;t want to use &quot; angle &quot; because that has a negative con@@ notation -- but do you know how this is going to play out ? ( MS : no idea . ) David Co@@ hn : how much money does it take to do this ?
turns out it really means , &quot; We want nothing to do with your movie . &quot;
what are some other metamor@@ phos@@ es that you &apos;ve had ?
Lind@@ say Z@@ al@@ tman : the first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distinct , but complementary sides to your brand personality -- the Morgan S@@ pur@@ lock brand is a mindful / play brand .
Thank you very much , guys .
( Applause ) June Cohen : so , Morgan , in the name of transparency , what exactly happened to that $ 7,@@ 100 ?
I met these guys called G@@ RL , Gra@@ ffiti Research Lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then , with a laser pointer , draw on it , and it just registers the negative space .
we took a P@@ S@@ 3 camera , hacked it open , mounted it to an LED light , and now there &apos;s a device that is free -- you build this yourself , we publish the code for free , you download the software for free .
and someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more .
I wanted to be a bi@@ ker chick .
I was 28 years old .
nobody &apos;s ever done it before , so I &apos;m going to go do it .
nine months later , after that day on s@@ not rock , I had the only blind date in my life with a seven and a half foot elephant called K@@ anch@@ i .
and that &apos;s the story that we tell in big history .
as long as we &apos;re teaching our kids that heroism starts when someone scrat@@ ches a mark on your forehead , or someone tells you you &apos;re part of a prophecy , they &apos;re missing the most important characteristic of leadership , which is that it comes from within .
how can we honestly and genuinely encourage more people to vote when votes don &apos;t count in Canada ?
now , the kind of shocks I &apos;m talking about are big -- a catac@@ ly@@ s@@ mic market crash , rising fascism , an industrial accident that poisons on a massive scale .
in the United States and elsewhere , governments began to weave a safety net so that the next time there was a crash there would be programs like social security to catch people .
a time when humanity dared to dream big about different kinds of futures , many of them organized along radically egalitarian lines .
for decades , social and labor movements had been building up their membership bases , linking their causes together and increasing their strength .
where climate activists used to talk about changing light bulbs , now we &apos;re pushing for 100 percent of our energy to come from the sun , wind and waves , and to do it fast .
right now , every alarm in our house is going off simultaneously .
I don &apos;t know .
I started working on my mother &apos;s signature , because my father &apos;s is absolutely impossible to forge .
well , they were out , but they were always in danger . the big &quot; Jew &quot; stamp was still on their papers .
to him , being paid would have meant being a mer@@ cen@@ ary .
my father watched , benevol@@ ently , of course , the demonstrations of the month of May , but his heart was elsewhere , and so was his time because he had over 15 countries to serve .
human speech is an ingenious manipulation of our breath within the sound chamber of our mouth and respiratory system .
all of their voices had been made by a speaker recording original words in a control booth .
if a computer voice can successfully tell a joke and do the timing and delivery as well as Hen@@ ny Youn@@ gman , then that &apos;s the voice I want .
then contributors from all over the world began showing up , prototyping new machines during dedicated project visits .
we actually had a guy from the BBC &apos;s &quot; Fro@@ zen Planet &quot; on one of these flights .
( Laughter ) And I was actually watching the series years later with my wife , and a scene like this came up , and I commented on how beautiful it was .
and if it does , we &apos;re going to need extremely low-cost sensors so we can deploy networks of hundreds or thousands of these on an ice sheet to do imaging .
in 1988 , at the University of Minnesota , I participated in a small series of whole organ pancreas transplants .
and here is the limitation : adult stem cells are mature cells , and , like mature human beings , these cells are more restricted in their thought and more restricted in their behavior and are unable to give rise to the wide variety of specialized cell types , as embryonic stem cells &#91; can &#93; .
and in our lab , we are focused on taking fat and re@@ programming mounds of fat into fountains of youthful cells -- cells that we may use to then form other , more specialized , cells , which one day may be used as cell transplants .
what do you think they &apos;re feeling ?
and if I can get you to step into their shoes and walk an inch -- one tiny inch -- then imagine the kind of soci@@ ological analysis that you can do in all other aspects of your life .
and second , why it &apos;s such a problem .
but the thing is , the coy@@ ote runs off the cliff right after him .
so by the time you are nine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are lazy , irresponsible di@@ m@@ wits -- and second of all , that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes .
so this is a huge practical problem .
they don &apos;t have access to the same information that we do , and when we gener@@ ously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our team .
we can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place .
and I mentioned this to him , and he was like , &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true .
( Laughter ) I mean , this is life .
and I &apos;d like to think of it as a 21st century wisdom table , really .
( video ) Boy : the World Peace Game is serious .
to her girlfriends she said that .
that &apos;s the kind of engagement you want to have happen .
the way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be solved and every country &apos;s asset value has to be increased above its starting point .
and suddenly , Bren@@ nan walked over to my chair and he grabbed the bell , the bell I ring to signal a change or a re@@ conven@@ ing of cabinets , and he ran back to his seat , rang the bell .
and most of the experiments , telescopes that I went to see are in some way addressing this question , these two twin mysteries of dark matter and dark energy .
but you need very , very large volumes of water in order to do this .
and you barely might be able to make out this hut here .
now , in case the weather changes before the launch , they have to actually pack everything back up into their boxes and take it out back to Mc@@ Mur@@ do Station .
and what struck me was every place that I went to to see these telescopes , the astronomers and cosmologists are in search of a certain kind of silence , whether it &apos;s silence from radio pollution or light pollution or whatever .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m a biologist , and the central theorem of our subject : the theory of design , Darwin &apos;s theory of evolution by natural selection .
&quot; no , I don &apos;t know that atheists should be considered citizens , nor should they be considered patri@@ ots .
about 20 percent are agnostic ; the rest could fairly be called atheists .
now , a friend , an intelligent lap@@ sed Jew , who , incidentally , observes the Sabbath for reasons of cultural solidarity , describes himself as a &quot; to@@ o@@ th-@@ fairy agnostic . &quot;
this has the advantage of a worldwide network of well-@@ organized associations and journals and things already in place .
many of you probably subscribe to our polite cultural belief that we should respect religion .
I &apos;ve not had a fight with my wife in two years .
that was us .
consider , first , the reality that people today , in some cultures , are making choices about their offspring .
will we use these choices to make a society that is better , that is more successful , that is kinder ?
you &apos;ve heard in the past several years , the world is safer because Saddam Hussein is not in power .
now , there are several biases in risk perception .
of course you can conceive a few options , like having a drink , writing a letter , also sleeping during this boring talk , if you can .
you move . you move in the space .
so somehow , innovation is predicted to become more difficult as your progress over time .
yet , it &apos;s 3,000 times tougher than its geological counterpart .
and so this works the same way ; you pick it up and pop it open .
MM : it starts playing immediately .
you can pinch into any page .
I &apos;ve been making toys for the last 30 years .
there was a person , Ani@@ l Sad@@ g@@ op@@ al , did a Ph.D. from Caltech and returned back as a molecular biologist in India &apos;s cutting-edge research institute , the T@@ I@@ FR .
and they have some wonderful properties .
you can just pull this out , this becomes a rectangle .
and every time I go to a school , I see a gle@@ am in the eyes of the children .
and if I take a re@@ ed -- if I rub this , something very amazing happens .
( Hon@@ k ) ( Applause ) And when you get a very small one -- ( Hon@@ k ) This is what the kids teach you . you can also do this .
she was the only mother in the group .
what did we want from each other ?
and the plastic bottle we &apos;re throwing away every day still stays there .
here is an image then of the building with the physical pixels , the pixels made of water , and then projections on them .
we &apos;ve been working with Rob@@ erto Bol@@ le , one of today &apos;s top ballet dancers -- the é@@ toi@@ le at Metropolitan in New York and La S@@ cal@@ a in Milan -- and actually captured his movement in 3D in order to use it as an input for F@@ ly@@ fire .
so you can reconstruct a whole movement .
you can enter inside it .
I guess it also looks a little bit like human skin , which intrigu@@ es me .
and using indi@@ go , make it anti-@@ microbial .
in every little cubic centimeter of space , whether or not there &apos;s stuff , whether or not there &apos;s particles , matter , radiation or whatever , there &apos;s still energy , even in the space itself .
he says , the problem with thermal equilibrium is that we can &apos;t live there .
that &apos;s my favorite scenario .
( Applause ) OK , this is the title of my talk today .
( Laughter ) So you &apos;re going to be able to go like this .
OK , now they &apos;re du@@ king it out . now they &apos;re du@@ king it out .
now let &apos;s talk about some of the characteristics that are important for this revolutionary device .
to watch them move is a dance I &apos;m never going to get tired of .
( Applause )
it &apos;s pure white , but it &apos;s not a polar bear .
I sat there on the river for two months without seeing one .
and this bear swam out to that seal -- 800 l@@ b@@ . be@@ arded seal -- grabbed it , swam back and ate it .
it acts like the soil in a garden . it &apos;s an inverted garden .
even though that spirit bear moment was powerful , I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll ever have another experience like I did with these leopard seals .
this is just the food chain unfolding .
and even in his voice , he goes , &quot; That &apos;s a bloody big seal , ya . &quot;
and just like the polar bears , these animals depend on an icy environment .
so it would be able to replicate the information that is on the DVD .
what you see there on the screen is a human hair superimposed on the needle that &apos;s made of silk -- just to give you a sense of size .
or you could put drugs in your wallet and not in your fridge .
when I first saw his picture , I thought that his superpowers came from his super collar .
when they &apos;re born , babies continue to smile -- initially , mostly in their sleep .
in fact , those with the most amazing superpowers are actually children , who smile as many as 400 times per day .
please , don &apos;t try this at home .
( Laughter ) And unlike lots of chocolate , lots of smiling can actually make you healthier .
he was , of course , foremost , a very , very , very great scientist .
we sat around and talked about this -- we of course never resolved it .
they had met the great man ; they had been instructed by the great man ; they had an enormous amount of fun having their faces shoved in the mud ...
in fact , he had been convinced at one time that to be a good physicist , it was very important to have had that kind of relationship with your father .
he would try to visualize it , guided by a small number of simple principles .
one loop , two loops -- maybe you could do a three-@@ loop diagram , but beyond that , you couldn &apos;t do anything .
the numbers don &apos;t do it justice , though .
you can see the animal is about two minutes into this .
seventy-five thousand people have Parkinson &apos;s deep-@@ brain stimul@@ ators implanted , maybe 100,000 people have cochlear implants , which allow them to hear .
on the other hand , light can still get into the eye .
Ed Boy@@ den : that &apos;s right .
and we &apos;ve been working to try to improve everything from the fabric to the format and structure and aesthetics .
but recently , any annual report of a power company doesn &apos;t have a power station on it .
song : ♫ We &apos;ve got the M@@ op T@@ ops , the Play-Doh M@@ op T@@ ops ♫ ♫ Just turn the chair and grow Play-Doh hair ♫ ♫ They &apos;re the M@@ op T@@ ops ♫ Thomas Hea@@ ther@@ wick : okay , you get the idea .
and the project that we &apos;re building in Malaysia is apartment buildings for a property developer .
so there was an incentive for the developer to really try to think about what would be better for the city .
it &apos;s actually only the first couple of floors that you really experience , and the rest of it is just for postcards .
they &apos;re actually identical , so it &apos;s quite cost-effective .
now what does it have to do with chronic pain ?
imagine I were to stroke your child &apos;s arm with this feather , and their brain &#91; was &#93; telling them that they were feeling this hot torch .
wrap it in an ACE band@@ age , take some ibuprofen for a week or two , and that &apos;s the end of the story .
we have to build them .
but when she got in , she kind of looked around , and she settled in .
so look out for it .
it grows very slowly .
here &apos;s another one . this is also a sea pen .
( gasps ) I &apos;d be very interested in your theories about what that &apos;s about .
but we did see a bunch of responses like this .
but not to worry .
people , if they drew a stick figure or a smiley face , it actually made it into the bill .
as you know , an animation is a series of images .
collaborator Four : I &apos;ve seen everybody from Japan , Venezuela , to the States , to Kno@@ x@@ ville , Tennessee .
so it was a massive effort .
and so when the going got really tough in the polio eradication program about two years ago , when people were saying , &quot; We should call it off , &quot; the Poli@@ o Part@@ nership decided to buckle down once again and try and find innovative new solutions , new ways to get to the children that we were missing again and again .
in northern India , we started mapping the cases using satellite imaging like this , so that we could guide our investments and vaccin@@ ator shelters , so we could get to the millions of children on the Kos@@ hi River basin where there are no other health services .
Ba : the four places where you saw , that we &apos;ve never stopped -- northern Nigeria , northern India , the southern corner of Afghanistan and bor@@ dering areas of Pakistan -- they &apos;re going to be the toughest .
so I made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life , and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse -- the subject of marty@@ r@@ dom , the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection of love of God , faith , but violence and crime and cruelty .
and there are strengths in Islamic tradition .
it &apos;s our faith , and we will be loyal to it .
and I think the West , at least some powers in the West , particularly the United States , made the mistake of supporting those secular dictators , thinking that they were more helpful for their interests .
( Applause ) DH : so since we started this project , we &apos;ve been getting hundreds of letters , emails , phone calls from people from all around the world .
this is a very quick overview of all the studies that I looked at .
beaver dams , yes . Hoover D@@ am , no .
what is this ant doing ? what is this in aid of ?
now , what theories do we want to use to look at this ?
there are other parasites that do this -- which render the host sterile .
that will encourage the spread of relatively benign mutations of the most toxic varieties .
how would your consciousness handle your body being del@@ oc@@ alized in space ?
you can almost always look phenomenal for under $ 50 .
which one is it ?
he thought it was impractical .
the three people who voted for M@@ ill before are familiar with this .
that &apos;s what she called the &quot; ban@@ ality of evil . &quot;
( Laughter ) So that &apos;s what I &apos;m here to tell you about : how we are going to fix a chicken .
there &apos;s a million a year who leave Latin America to go to the United States .
both are viable ; both take off .
and a lot of what I &apos;ve worked on is people who have at@@ ypical sex -- so people who don &apos;t have the standard male or the standard female body types .
now you might think that all this break@@ ing-@@ down of categories would make somebody like me really happy .
it turns out to be really difficult .
do we really want to go there ?
what do you think you &apos;d have in a month ?
I mean , this is the iPhone 4 .
for about 5,000 dollars , I can have the power of a very powerful diagnostic device in my hand .
you step on the scale , tweet your weight to your friends , they can keep you in line .
we can now leverage microflui@@ dic@@ s , like this chip made by Steve Qu@@ ake at Stanford .
when was the last time your doctor asked where you &apos;ve lived ?
the bodies of plankton &apos;s ancestors actually make up a for lot of the carbon we burn today .
( Laughter ) So welcome all to the wonderful world of life in a drop of water .
so there &apos;s not going to be a wall that is high enough to separate humanity .
and I tell you , long after the lights have gone off Mexico , Se@@ mil@@ las will be there with the communities , with the women , for a very long time .
I &apos;m a contemporary artist with a bit of an unexpected background .
and what that is is I imagine explaining a work of art to my grandmother in five minutes , and if I can &apos;t explain it in five minutes , then it &apos;s too ob@@ t@@ use or esoteric and it hasn &apos;t been refined enough yet .
and it would have &quot; hand &quot; in that it would be greatly crafted .
so I thought , a bi@@ ennial needs artists .
and this piece : those aren &apos;t actually leaves .
next is May@@ n@@ ard Si@@ pes .
last in reading , math and science . last .
so I think it should be really , really clear that our system is broken .
step one : woman says , &quot; I want to have a baby . I@@ sk@@ am baby . &quot;
( Laughter ) And we said , &quot; He &apos;s five . &quot;
throughout the animal kingdom , for example : ants . ants play .
it &apos;s a universal thing -- we play .
he &apos;s having fun , he &apos;s in the groo@@ ve , he &apos;s in the flow .
independent analysis from anonymous employees on their surveys .
so some steps that we can take -- to finish up -- how to make this revolution through play .
you guys have to , and if you &apos;re not feeling it , your colleagues , your employees , aren &apos;t going to feel it .
unacceptable . Ne@@ pri@@ em@@ li@@ v .
through my work I &apos;m trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected .
the second place that I feel free is after scoring a goal on the soccer pitch .
they thought that we were more interested , as an industry , in profits , rather than progress , and that we filled the skies with smog -- and frankly , we were the enemy .
now the good news is some of this work has already begun in different parts of the world .
these are all really good ideas that will move us forward .
but very soon we &apos;re going to see the days when cars are essentially talking to each other .
for example , the calculation : can you feel where on the number line the solution is likely to fall ?
what about 75 ?
she saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom in the teachers &apos; lounge .
and yet despite this , hardly any of us have ever heard space .
some of the crack@@ les and pops were lightning , but the eerie whistles and curiously melo@@ dious chir@@ ps had a rather more exotic origin .
everyone is just a little bit mad .
and before I get started today , since many of you are wondering , I just wanted to get it out of the way .
you can see that it got started right here .
Larry Page : Thank you , Sergey .
I think usually , as companies get bigger , they find it really hard to have small , innovative projects .
this is another example of a project that somebody at Google was really passionate about , and they just , they got going , and it &apos;s really , really a great product , and really taking off .
it makes content get better , it makes searching work better , when people can really make their livelihood from producing great content .
but finding things is tricky , and so you really want intelligence .
I &apos;d like to begin with a thought experiment .
all knowledge of the English language and the English alphabet has been lost .
now we don &apos;t know if it says Hollywood , or even Bollywood for that matter .
there &apos;s a last group of people who believe that the Indus people were the ancestors of people living in South India today .
but deciph@@ ering the script is a very challenging task .
linguistic scripts occupy the middle range .
I &apos;ll explain what that term means .
one was growing out the back and it attached to the p@@ so@@ as muscle , which is a big muscle in the back that I &apos;d never heard of , but all of a sudden I cared about it .
government-@@ approved , American Cancer Society , but patients know what patients want to know .
and when she came down those steps , and it was just her and me for that moment , I was so glad that she didn &apos;t have to say to her mother , &quot; I wish Dad could have been here . &quot;
the other thing , it &apos;s generated , obviously , a lot of economic value ; it &apos;s also inspired , I think , a lot of great architecture .
and we &apos;ve already started construction on section two .
but what really , I think , makes the High Line special is the people .
but the other thing is that maybe we could se@@ duce people into stuff that was a little more technical , maybe a little bit more scientific , maybe a little bit more che@@ f-@@ y than they otherwise would have .
here &apos;s a step-by-step that shows grinding hamburger .
as it comes out of the grin@@ der , you just have a little tray , and you just take it off in little passes , build it up , slice it vertically .
they take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources .
you can take cutt@@ ings ; they can sort of have sex with themselves ; they can pollinate themselves .
and under the scanning electron microscope , you can see the surface there -- really quite different from the other surfaces we looked at .
and this one doesn &apos;t have anything for them .
now com@@ as are measured on a scale from 15 down to three .
it &apos;s a cu@@ pu@@ le that took 40 to 50,000 blows with a stone tool to create , and it &apos;s the first known expression of art on the planet .
unlike the smashed glass of my car , plasticity of the brain means that there was always a possibility , with treatment , to train the brain so that you can regain and raise your level of awareness and consciousness .
and with accommod@@ ation , they went on to college and had a full life in terms of their opportunities .
I believe that we can all rise and shine .
I didn &apos;t expect that person that I was going to meet to be him .
but this is blinking all the time . it &apos;s sending signals in real time .
I must tell you , they &apos;re an amazing -- there &apos;s a hundred people who work in that building -- engineers , scientists , and other team members -- all the time .
educator and philosopher Paulo Fre@@ ire believed that teaching and learning should be two-way .
and the abuse I was suffering at the hands of my father and his friends had left me a total wreck .
so I end my talk , really , where I started , talking about my own personal experience .
an identity was defined primarily by religion .
and that &apos;s something which I &apos;d like to elaborate on .
the Old mentality with a capital O , as represented by the nation-state , not yet fully into the age of behavior , not recognizing the power of transnational social movements , got left behind .
so what &apos;s needed is those organizations on the ground advocating for the democratic culture itself to create the demand on the ground for this culture .
and the next morning , supplies of vitamin B@@ 12 are delivered to the camp , and the prisoners begin to recover .
brilliant work .
you try out all 10 . you keep the one that works best .
they &apos;re not statistically significant .
your father is murdered .
I &apos;ve guessed you &apos;ve already noticed this by now .
and I was privileged because I was born into a family , my father would always encourage the boys and the girls .
and he was such an extraordinary man .
now of course , we had a very interesting discussion .
what we have here is a list of old viruses .
and that , obviously , is a problem .
and he put blo@@ gged images about the car accident -- that &apos;s his Mer@@ ce@@ des -- right here is the L@@ ada Sam@@ ara he crashed into .
now I told you -- ( Laughter ) I love the Internet . I do .
I see beauty in the future of the Internet , but I &apos;m worried that we might not see that .
but my skin color wasn &apos;t right .
and when I realized and really understood that my self is a projection and that it has a function , a funny thing happened .
but I &apos;m not ashamed of my self .
imagine what kind of existence we can have if we honor inevitable death of self , appreciate the privilege of life and marvel at what comes next .
and he said , &quot; Yeah . &quot; he said , &quot; But that &apos;s if you &apos;re a radar .
what do you do when you grow up ? &quot;
and I said , &quot; What &apos;s the black box for Wall Street ? &quot;
all of a sudden , nine percent just goes away , and nobody to this day can even agree on what happened because nobody ordered it , nobody asked for it .
and you see this behavior on Amazon as surely as you see it on Wall Street .
so none of this mi@@ she@@ gas of letting everybody go into whatever car they want .
( Laughter ) Like the things that people use .
and this is what we &apos;re designing for .
and they operate on milliseconds and microseconds .
so within the motor , we have three Hall sensors , so we know exactly where the wing is .
so , as the president now reas@@ sures us , we are on track to achieve our goals .
you exaggerate your fears , and you &apos;re terrified about the humiliation of defeat .
what we look for in firemen , in climbers , in policemen , and what we should look for in intervention , is intelligent risk takers -- not people who plunge blind off a cliff , not people who jump into a burning room , but who weigh their risks , weigh their responsibilities .
the problem in Libya is that we are always pushing for the black or white .
and so there &apos;s an urgent need for a scientific theory of cities .
what do we learn from that ?
that is , you ask any generic question about this -- how many trees of a given size , how many branches of a given size does a tree have , how many leaves , what is the energy flowing through each branch , what is the size of the canopy , what is its growth , what is its mortality ?
and the idea is can we do the same for this ?
and that is one of the main reasons life is so resilient and robust -- scal@@ ability .
and indeed , one of the wonderful things about the theory is that if you have super-@@ linear scaling from wealth creation and innovation , then indeed you get , from the same theory , a beautiful rising exponential curve -- lovely .
if it has this su@@ blin@@ ear scaling , the theory says we should have sig@@ mo@@ idal growth .
I was sitting in my car , looking in the re@@ ar@@ view mirror , trying to figure out which friend I could call to call in a bomb threat , so I didn &apos;t have to go back in the building .
I looked at myself in the mirror , and I said ...
take out a white@@ board and draw pictures and make connections that they can understand .
because finally , I was standing in their shoes .
more than teaching .
that &apos;s not because , or it &apos;s not simply because , I &apos;m a sno@@ b and want to boast about having an original .
it was the same art , physically , but the history had changed .
the third drops , the fourth , the fifth .
( Applause )
well after many years working in trade and economics , four years ago , I found myself working on the front lines of human vulnerability .
I &apos;d like to talk about some of the things I &apos;ve seen on the front lines of hunger , some of the things I &apos;ve learned in bringing my economic and trade knowledge and my experience in the private sector .
I &apos;d like to talk about where the gap of knowledge is .
the next thing I want to talk about is school feeding .
today , food aid , our food aid -- huge engine -- 80 percent of it is bought in the developing world .
I believe no one is ignorant .
and this is really what I want to talk to you about today -- about cancer .
but then again , this fact that the metastases didn &apos;t go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely .
we spend roughly 60 percent of our communication time listening , but we &apos;re not very good at it .
now -- not you , not this talk , but that is generally true .
how many individual channels in that mix am I listening to ?
right now there are 48 hours of video being uploaded to YouTube every single minute .
I think as machines &apos; ability to understand human language and process vast amounts of data continues to improve , it &apos;s going to become possible to analyze an entire life &apos;s worth of content -- the Twee@@ ts , the photos , the videos , the blog posts -- that we &apos;re producing in such massive numbers .
these are cellular mobile phones .
then there &apos;s another issue that you &apos;re all aware of .
and this is a fundamental basic property that we exploit with our technology .
you also have a critical question now , and you say , &quot; Okay , do I have to have the light on all the time to have this working ? &quot;
capacity : we have 10,000 times more spectrum , 10,000 times more LEDs installed already in the infrastructure there .
and this light can be used to transmit wireless data that these things &#91; use &#93; to communicate with each other .
we call it , in fact , a Li@@ -Fi , light-@@ fidelity .
even today , we know that there are words we cannot use , phrases we cannot say , because if we do so , we might be acc@@ os@@ ted , jailed , or even killed .
and this is because in small groups there are fewer ideas , there are fewer innovations .
and to see why , consider two scenarios from early in our evolution .
you put down your arrowheads and say , &quot; I &apos;d like to trade these arrowheads for finished arrows . I &apos;ll split you 50 / 50 . &quot;
once we have language , we can put our ideas together and cooperate to have a prosperity that we couldn &apos;t have before we acquired it .
if 27 individuals from those 27 member states sat around table , speaking their 23 languages , some very simple mathematics will tell you that you need an army of 25@@ 3 translators to anticipate all the pair@@ wise possibilities .
it matters because the health care industry is the second most energy intensive industry in the United States .
militias were raping six-@@ month-old babies so that countries far away could get access to gold and col@@ tan for their iPhones and computers .
and the fire that burned in me on day three through six of chemo is the fire that is burning in the forests of the world .
it was the sorrow that &apos;s taken so long .
attention allows us to notice , select and direct the brain &apos;s computational resources to a subset of all that &apos;s available .
think of medical professionals or firefighters or soldiers or marines .
so in some of our other studies , we wanted to see , OK , great -- not great , actually , bad news that stress does this to the brain -- but if it is the case that stress has this powerful influence on attention through external distraction , what if we don &apos;t need external distraction , what if we distract ourselves ?
what about in the real world ?
what about now ?
here &apos;s the prediction .
you will be unaware of what I &apos;m saying for four out of the next eight minutes .
I know that the doctors who worked on me , they saved my heart , but mindfulness saved my life .
so we have visions like this .
at the time , I was working down the street .
so all of those penguins had to have the oil meticulously cleaned from their bodies .
he was a prisoner of war .
the fact is that , if I tried and it didn &apos;t work , then I could make a statement about how unwilling the global community is to unite -- until , it was in Somalia , picking up that young girl .
and we have to make this day work .
and that made me think that , if we can get 70 percent in Afghanistan , then surely we can get 70 percent reduction everywhere .
( Applause ) Thank you .
and it &apos;s a tremendous problem for us .
and if there is one tremendous -- if there is one great catastrophe about the places that we &apos;ve built , the human environments we &apos;ve made for ourselves in the last 50 years , it is that it has deprived us of the ability to live in a hopeful present .
a public place so dismal that the win@@ os don &apos;t even want to go there . ( Laughter ) And we can &apos;t fix it because I.@@ M. Pe@@ i &apos;s still alive , and every year Harvard and M.@@ I.T. have a joint committee to repair it .
this , in fact , would be a better building if we put mosaic portraits of Jos@@ ef Stalin , P@@ ol P@@ ot , Saddam Hussein , and all the other great desp@@ ots of the 20th century on the side of the building , because then we &apos;d honestly be saying what the building is really communicating to us .
but what happens is , of course , it mutates over the next 80 years and it turns into something rather insidious .
and that &apos;s the great non-@@ articulated agony of suburbia and one of the reasons that it l@@ ends itself to ridicule .
be prepared to find vo@@ cations that make you useful to your neighbors and to your fellow citizens .
this is coming from a Jewish guy , all right , so that means a lot .
so I looked carefully at this guy .
farther back is there one shared with chimpanzees .
and if you do that , you find a certain amount of genetic variation in Africa .
this may be surprising .
they spread across Africa also , of course , and there were older , earlier forms of humans there .
( gun@@ shots ) Man : these are live bullets .
it &apos;s like F@@ allu@@ jah . shooting everywhere .
the first is that we need to decode all of the complexity of what we want to build -- so our buildings and machines .
and it was really her strength , I believe , that became the kind of mu@@ dra and impri@@ mat@@ ur that has been a guiding light in my life .
( Applause ) If compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we train our health care providers in compassion so that they can do what they &apos;re supposed to do , which is to really transform suffering ?
the wound is just filled with maggots .
think of the financial world , for example .
if we think , for example , of Louis Pa@@ ste@@ ur , who in the 18@@ 60s was asked to study the diseases of silk worms for the silk industry , and his discoveries were really the beginning of the germ theory of disease .
I love manipulating the infrastructure of biology .
we can do it microflui@@ dically , we can do it lith@@ ograp@@ hically , we can do it in a 3D printer , we can do it in droplets for colleagues .
when ?
LC : I think it &apos;s 100 percent .
you know , I don &apos;t even believe in the concept of an ideal family .
and for the first time , I was affected by this communal unrest .
but firms like ours are having to move to a point where we get those objects that we &apos;re designing and get them in motion , showing how they &apos;ll be used .
( SA : life would be sweet in a cubicle like this . ) DK : this next project , we were asked to design a pavilion to celebrate the recycling of the water on the Millennium Dome in London .
it turns out even during the Cultural Revolution , China out-@@ perf@@ omed India in terms of GDP growth by an average of about 2.2 percent every year in terms of per capita GDP .
but India still has a lot of work to do in terms of gender equality .
in fact , if you compare India with the average developing country , even before the more recent period of acceleration of Indian growth -- now India is growing between eight and nine percent -- even before this period , India was ranked fourth in terms of economic growth among emerging economies .
the first is that we need to change our mindsets .
this is how they were advertising themselves a decade ago on the Net .
and when he finally woke up to his situation and understood the implications , he was already in too deep .
and it is a tool that actually enables one to listen to their own in@@ nar@@ ds .
( Laughter ) And so some of these things are actually more ge@@ ared toward expression and communication .
the price of a base , to sequence a base , has fallen 100 million times .
guys , this is a long scale ; you don &apos;t typically see lines that go up like that .
unless there &apos;s anybody in the audience who &apos;d like to volunteer to stop eating ?
it was Bob M@@ et@@ cal@@ fe inventing the E@@ ther@@ net , and the connection of all these computers that fundamentally changed everything .
there &apos;s already a lab today that tests for allele 3@@ 34 of the A@@ V@@ P@@ R@@ 1 gene , the so-called cheating gene .
OK , so experts think that one to three percent of you are not actually the father of your child .
I want to say that really and truly , after these incredible speeches and ideas that are being spread , I am in the awkward position of being here to talk to you today about television .
the average American watches TV for almost 5 hours a day .
we know that about 106 billion people have ever lived .
we know that most of that wealth was made after the year 1800 .
hardly anyone in South America did .
ladies and gentlemen , a picture is not worth a thousand words .
so we were thinking , well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books .
now of course , if there &apos;s a scale for how awesome that is , that has to rank extremely , extremely high .
now the problem is there &apos;s an X-@@ axis for that , which is the practical axis .
that &apos;s 12 percent of all the books that have ever been published .
it &apos;s people back home , people that support their work , people like these .
paradoxically , once established , natural selection actually favors the continued growth of cancer .
it spreads through the population , has mutations that allow it to evade the immune system , and it &apos;s the only cancer that we know of that &apos;s threatening an entire species with extinction .
my friends , the doodle has never been the ne@@ mesis of intellectual thought .
I gave her reassurance , but shortly after ...
she died of Ebola .
I measured my body temperature several times .
but for the last 20 years , we &apos;ve been holding hands before every meal .
and that is how steth@@ oscope and aus@@ cul@@ tation was born .
Fil@@ des &apos; oldest son , Philip , died at the age of nine on Christmas Eve after a brief illness .
we went from bed to bed . the attending physician was in charge .
there was just no way .
you work by learning , and you learn by working .
this is one from Yor@@ k@@ shire where , in fact , my nephew , I hope , will be able to attend it .
so here I was , December 7th , 2008 .
the heat was on .
I mean , at the absolute time for the absolute need of democracy , they did not abuse their power .
it &apos;s not just taking a pill and performance or pain improving ; it &apos;s about our beliefs and expectations , the cultural meaning of a treatment .
but in a lot of situations that &apos;s wrong ; often , we already have a good treatment currently available .
it &apos;s at the top of the pyramid of evidence .
enter Harry Beck .
meanwhile , over in America , in Con@@ cord , Massachusetts , it was Henry David Tho@@ reau who came up with the grading scale for different hard@@ nesses of pencil .
K@@ O@@ H-@@ I-@@ N@@ OO@@ R did this crazy thing where they painted this pencil with 14 coats of yellow paint and di@@ pped the end in 14-@@ car@@ at gold .
I assume stairs came to be from the first time someone said , &quot; I want to get to this higher rock from the lower rock . &quot;
and so if you &apos;re able to sit halfway up there , you &apos;re in a kind of magical place .
on T@@ enc@@ ent , 200 million .
and because of selected abortion by families who favored boys to girls , now we have ended up with 30 million more young men than women .
so when these incidents are reported more and more frequently on the Internet , people cry for the government to take actions to stop this .
and also , people are doing good through social media .
later , I would work on evolutionary genetics , and I would work on systems biology .
in fact , it should perhaps make use of the concepts that I developed just in order to sort of capture what a simple living system might be . &quot;
and the way we would do that -- I would like to find out how I can distinguish text that was written by a million monkeys , as opposed to text that is in our books .
my family was living in a hut .
it &apos;s time for me to let it go .
we want space efficiency .
what &apos;s in yours ?
this was my introduction to the Wild West .
we need to start a campaign to get people engaged with this idea .
and , actually , I think we can dust off Stephen Ma@@ ther &apos;s playbook .
I want to be a part of that . &quot;
and we have an opportunity right now , just as they did 100 years ago , to protect these places , to put in a plan , to keep people engaged .
( Applause )
and I &apos;d like to start at the very beginning .
we said , there &apos;s got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics .
and not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint , sustainable from an economic standpoint as well .
it looks like the Wil@@ ly Won@@ ka factory at this point .
at the end of this process , we have a mixed plastic composite : many different types of plastics and many different grades of plastics .
I have to trust the orchestra , and , even more crucially , I have to trust myself .
a very simple tune based on three notes -- T , E , D .
if you &apos;ll pardon the expression .
( audience murmurs ) But for good behavior , they threw in an occupational therapist who taught me that very essential skill of cross-@@ stitching .
they went to the Board of Education and they demanded that the Board of Ed make some of the high schools accessible .
so I said to her , is it a requirement that teachers show their students how to go to the bathroom ?
( Applause ) And she knew discrimination when she saw it .
do you have a guess ? how many ?
we wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people .
and this is a bird on the cover of science who &apos;s learned how to use a tool to get food .
this is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others .
the first one is , again , remember , these are four year-olds .
boy : what &apos;s making this light up .
you see , using this bit , the thin@@ ky bit , the slow bit of the brain -- using that .
this is just the bit that pro@@ tru@@ des into our physical dimension .
it &apos;s something much bigger .
layer after layer of legend , sport , details that resonate .
you may see 50 , 100 , 200 things on a shelf as you walk down it , but I have to work within that domain , to ensure that it gets you there first .
only sometimes . only sometimes .
with one item in its thought , it snaps instantly to the next item .
and by the mid-@@ 60s , he was able to put this into action when he worked at the Stanford Research Lab in California .
Go@@ wers is also a blogger , and in January of 2009 , he used his blog to pose a very striking question : is massively collaborative mathematics possible ?
OK ?
and today , I &apos;m very pleased to say , as a result , you can go online -- anybody here -- and download the human genome .
you can also , if you &apos;re more ambitious , start an open science project of your own .
you can talk to your friends and acquaint@@ ances who are scientists and just ask them what are they doing to work more openly .
so it &apos;s my interpretation of building the future .
and they start up that path by accepting a core proposition , and that proposition is the following : lying is a cooperative act .
PM : okay , those head shakes are much easier to spot once you know to look for them .
it &apos;s a kind of imprin@@ ting and selective breeding process for the afterlife .
we want to eat , not be eaten by , our food .
and the saying goes , we came from dust and will return to dust .
I believe this is the beginning of true environmental responsibility .
I said , &quot; I want to live and dig wells for five years . &quot;
I said , &quot; No . &quot;
there are no contracts , no written contracts .
I was in a bit of a spot .
and the girl , who &apos;s on her left , turned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye and said , &quot; Please tell her I &apos;m the prime minister . &quot;
puppets is the way we communicate .
went straight to the president .
she walked out of the plane and spoke to the whole press as if she was a veteran .
this is the code that &apos;s in every single one of our 50 trillion cells that makes us who we are and what we are .
two nanometers is 20 atoms in thickness .
and that makes a lot of sense .
what were you doing ?
the theorist guy says , &quot; I think this is what &apos;s going on , &quot; the experim@@ ent@@ alist says , &quot; You &apos;re wrong . &quot;
humans uniquely have the same mechanism on the front , but we use it for motor control .
it so happens that these weapons are dangerous .
in 1982 , in the middle of the Cold War in Soviet Siberia , a pipeline exploded with a burst of 3 kil@@ ot@@ ons , the equivalent of a fourth of the Hiroshima bomb .
current key exchange techniques will not stand up to a quantum computer .
except this time , instead of a call to give James the code , we &apos;re going to use quantum effects on a laser to carry the code and send it over standard optic fiber to James .
the state of the art is what we call my@@ o@@ electric prostheses .
you &apos;re missing not only these muscles , but your hand and your elbow too .
this is what happens when Jesse thinks open and close his hand , or bend or straigh@@ ten your elbow .
this was one of our first patients , Chris .
TK : so we &apos;re really excited , because now we &apos;re getting to a clinically practical device .
I want you to watch closely .
and there , you see it in relation to the measure of inequality I &apos;ve just shown you , which I shall use over and over again in the data .
the more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems .
what all the data I &apos;ve shown you so far says is the same thing .
but it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison .
Sweden has huge differences in earnings , and it narrows the gap through taxation , general welfare state , generous benefits and so on .
( Laughter ) The theme of this morning &apos;s session is Things We Make .
and so they flew missions day and night , and they dropped thousands of bombs , and they fired thousands of missiles in an attempt to get rid of this particular scourge .
well it is the grandson of the Norden Mark 15 bombsight .
and as was typical with the Norden bombsight , the bomb actually missed its target by 800 ft .
we didn &apos;t fly him to Boston .
mice with multiple myel@@ oma , an incurable malign@@ ancy of the bone marrow , respond dramatically to the treatment with this drug .
and , really , this is the fourth of these molecules to kind of &quot; graduate &quot; from our little pipeline of drug discovery , two of which -- a topical drug for lymp@@ homa of the skin and an oral substance for the treatment of multiple myel@@ oma -- will actually come to the bedside for the first clinical trial in July of this year -- for us , a major and exciting milestone .
and very often I &apos;ve been an outsider .
&quot; Re@@ ef@@ City . &quot;
I was also interested in the physic@@ ality of this format , because you have to walk to see it .
it &apos;s not autobiographical identities .
so I can call it techno-@@ crafted .
and it &apos;s what story cutting is all about .
what houses were left looked like cardboard boxes left in the rain ; two-@@ story mon@@ str@@ os@@ ities with wide-@@ open shells and melted por@@ ches .
( voice breaking ) Because the neighborhood hadn &apos;t died .
during the year I worked on my house before moving in , I lived in a micro@@ community inside Po@@ le@@ town , founded by a wild and virtuous farmer named Paul We@@ er@@ tz .
from 10 : 30 a.m. to 12 : 00 p.m. , I met with Judith who was one of my graduate students at the time .
( Laughter ) I was like , &quot; No , no . I &apos;m pretty certain there were no explosives .
but I &apos;ll watch myself . it &apos;s okay .
and then my pick@@ led jellyfish at the Hong Kong Super@@ market on Rou@@ te 18 in East Brun@@ sw@@ ick .
all of these are extracted directly from my bank accounts , and everything pops up right away .
this is a parking lot in El@@ ko , Nevada off of Rou@@ te 80 at 8 : 01 p.m. on August 19th .
so again , you have to do some detective work here .
and I understand that , on an individual level , it &apos;s purely symbolic .
I &apos;m still doing this project , but it is obsolete , because you &apos;re all doing it .
so you can see that the Hom@@ eland Security likes to come by -- Department of Hom@@ eland Security .
so I tend to do those things .
but he was , in fact , a moral philosopher , and he was right on why we &apos;re moral .
we have to find the owner for this . &quot; I said , &quot; Ye@@ a . &quot;
and that &apos;s actually what drew me to the Mola in the first place , was this terribly bizarre shape .
but unfortunately Molas , even though they don &apos;t school , they still get caught in nets as by-@@ catch .
and in the Mediterranean , in the sword@@ fish net fisheries , they make up up to 90 percent .
and it works .
while nearly all of the commercial air travel in the world goes through a relatively small number of large hub airports , there is a huge underutilized resource out there .
if you &apos;re playing against a very good opponent , they may distribute it in that green area , which is the prior distribution , making it hard for you to return .
and to do that , I &apos;ll tell you about how the brain deals with sensory input .
so I get two sources .
and in the intervening years I had two daughters .
and player two &apos;s been told , remember the experience of that force .
we all move the same way pretty much .
maybe we don &apos;t all quite move the same way .
maybe there &apos;s variation in the population .
and you &apos;ll say : &quot; Ah , that &apos;s because there is a reason , here ! &quot;
you write to your grandmother . I &apos;m going to show grandma to you .
I think it is an area ... that comes in handy . ( Applause ) And now I &apos;m going to follow Man@@ uel &#91; For@@ ja@@ z &#93; &apos; s advise . if it &apos;s time to ask , whoever wants to sponsor the &quot; Clar@@ o &quot; Guide of Justice -- I don &apos;t know ...
now this is necessary to distinguish the self from the environment .
these are also , these tar@@ -@@ fueled protocells , are also able to locate resources in their environment .
and the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space , and as if you were looking out into the tw@@ inkling night sky .
Thank you .
we chart it , we &apos;ve described it , we &apos;ve drawn it , we &apos;ve mapped it .
most people , when they first look at a fresh human brain , they say , &quot; It doesn &apos;t look what you &apos;re typically looking at when someone shows you a brain . &quot;
so the red levels are where a gene is turned on to a great degree .
now remember , we &apos;re as@@ saying genes .
these are things where genes are turned on in an individual cell type .
and we &apos;ll act as if it &apos;s just an unfortunate mistake we &apos;ve made , forgetting our pants on this cold January day .
( Laughter ) And I told people , &quot; Don &apos;t work . don &apos;t actually do work .
you can see them in this footage .
and of course they don &apos;t .
a study by the Economic Commission for Africa showed a clear trend upwards in governance in 28 African countries .
and with the support of a leader who was willing , at the time , to do the reforms , we put forward a comprehensive reform program , which we developed ourselves .
can you believe that prior to this reform -- which started at the end of 2003 , when I left Washington to go and take up the post of Finance Minister -- we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop 4@@ ,500 land@@ lines in its entire 30-year history ?
( Laughter ) The smartest one , first to come in , was the MT@@ N company of South Africa .
and in the three years that I was Finance Minister , they made an average of 360 million dollars profit per year .
when they crashed , we crashed .
and sometimes he assi@@ sts that with his hands , sometimes even with the leg .
BG : what kind of training do you do , you personally , for that ?
( Laughter ) And yeah , that &apos;s all .
I thought , okay , I will go out .
this is risky stuff indeed .
so just as a curiosity , where did you land when you flew over the Grand Canyon ?
I &apos;ve always had a fascination for computers and technology , and I made a few apps for the iPhone , iPod touch , and iPad .
( Laughter ) Where do you go to find out how to make an app ?
I &apos;ve gotten a lot of inspiration from Steve Jobs , and I &apos;ve started an app club at school , and a teacher at my school is kindly spon@@ soring my app club .
because I can .
( Laughter ) There are also really big differences in how people think about time .
so you can see in black , after a month -- they &apos;re very short-@@ lived ; that &apos;s why we like to study them for studies of aging -- in black , after a month , the normal worms are all dead .
( Laughter ) Okay .
that &apos;s what that arrow means .
under those conditions , the FOXO protein in blue has gone into the nucleus -- that little compartment there in the middle of the cell -- and it &apos;s sitting down on a gene binding to it .
you see one gene . there are lots of genes actually that bind on FOXO .
so maybe he &apos;s a little bit lazy , but he &apos;s there , he &apos;s taking care of the building .
and you can take rap@@ amy@@ cin and give it to a mouse -- even when it &apos;s pretty old , like age 60 for a human , that old for a mouse -- if you give the mouse rap@@ amy@@ cin , it will live longer .
and they &apos;ve been tagged , and they &apos;ve been found to be 70 years old .
they &apos;re more resistant to these kinds of stresses .
that is a good thing .
this is a wonderful thing .
( Laughter ) And that is all of these different things -- the love for my child .
right ? because I &apos;m a games guy and this is how I make my living .
the evidence is found in the games they play .
it also reinforced this idea , which should go over well here as well , that multi@@ lingu@@ al people outperform monol@@ ingu@@ al people on most standardized tests by about 15 % .
we can &apos;t blan@@ ke@@ t-@@ say that they don &apos;t affect kids .
in many Scandin@@ avian countries , the ticket you get is actually based not only on how fast you were going , but how much money you make : the more you make , the bigger the ticket .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It is game thinking -- that term I described earlier , the core foundation of gamification -- in its purest and most beautiful form : take a big , negative reinforcement loop and turn it into small , incremental positive reinforcement loop .
it &apos;s a world in which things move at faster pace than they did for you and me .
it turns out that we are already out of touch .
everybody knows it &apos;s cooler under a cloud .
and there are some very good reasons for that .
so , let me tell you this : when Wal-Mart achiev@@ es 20 percent energy reductions , that &apos;s going to be a very big deal . but I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s not enough .
less than one day of Exxon &apos;s revenues .
well , I &apos;ll tell you what . green technologies -- going green -- is bigger than the Internet .
some of them are smaller .
but it turns out , you don &apos;t need something six miles across to do a lot of damage .
( Laughter ) It was 1908 . that &apos;s fine . I can live with that .
if one of these things were to hit pretty much anywhere , it would cause a panic .
in 2017 , we face this mixture of Indians in head@@ dresses going across the plains but also the drunk sitting on a porch somewhere you never heard of , living off government handouts and cas@@ ino money .
one in three Native women are raped in her lifetime .
so these are just a few of an enormous number of gifts to which we can open your heart .
and that you can actually get optimal nutritional yield by running a kind of high-quality liquid soil over plants &apos; root systems .
but the first few systems were these leaky , loud power-@@ gu@@ zz@@ lers that Martha Stewart would definitely never have approved .
it took building a whole bunch of systems to get it right , but once we did , we were able to cut our carbon footprint nearly in half .
( Laughter ) And if I snow@@ boarded again , my feet aren &apos;t going to get cold .
I started snow@@ boarding , then I went back to work , then I went back to school .
no , don &apos;t just give me an example .
so let &apos;s start off by defining some terms .
we wish we &apos;d taken better advantage of the education that we did have .
this real sense of alienation from the part of us that made a decision we regret .
we can &apos;t identify with that part .
but I &apos;ll let you see it anyway .
my first experiences , though , did come from Cambodia , and at the time I remember first coming to Cambodia and there were , in 1994 , still less than 10 attorneys in the country because the Khmer Rouge had killed them all .
today I want to share with you some of the amazing things that scientists are discovering about what fetuses learn while they &apos;re still in their mothers &apos; bellies .
one researcher says that they probably sound a lot like the the voice of Charlie Brown &apos;s teacher in the old &quot; Pe@@ an@@ uts &quot; cartoon .
bodies that were built to hang onto every calorie found themselves swimming in the superfluous calories of the post-war Western diet .
I &apos;m not sure if I have time to show you any other environments .
( Laughter ) I guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras : it &apos;s everything from cell@@ -@@ phone cameras to professional S@@ L@@ Rs , quite a large number of them , stitched together in this environment .
it &apos;s doing that based on the content inside the images .
it enters a new state of matter called a super@@ fluid .
all of this could wipe out the savings we &apos;re hoping to make in the first place .
rather than dancing our Ph@@ .D@@ s , we should use dance to explain all of our complex problems .
I hope you join our conversation , too .
and when it comes to sensory restoration , we &apos;re still very far away from being able to provide beauty .
now if we could just play this .
but although these hearing aids were the most powerful hearing aids on the market at the time , they weren &apos;t very helpful .
I know that many of you have heard the traveler &apos;s adage , &quot; Take nothing but pictures , leave nothing but footprints . &quot;
it could be Somalia today .
I &apos;m going to turn now to some NGO imagery which will be familiar to some of you in this audience .
I will continue to work as a researcher and a reporter in developing countries , but I do it with an altered ethic of seeing .
the moon sees somebody that I don &apos;t see .
I was listing things I thought I was gonna get to be : a princess and a baller@@ ina and an astronaut .
I was always scared that I was falling behind .
it took us 10 years to unite 18 opposition party leaders , with their big egos , behind one single candidate against the Balk@@ an dictator Slo@@ bo@@ dan Mil@@ os@@ evi@@ c .
now , at the end , nonviolent discipline .
you have 100,000 people in a nonviolent march , one idiot or ag@@ ent-@@ provo@@ cate@@ ur throwing a stone .
( Laughter ) So you start with a book and then you scan it .
the first one is a lack of bilingu@@ als .
but what , exactly , is spider silk ?
and you wonder why .
all those tumors have heavy bleeding during periods , abdominal pressure , back pain , frequent ur@@ ination .
( Applause ) So in conclusion , I &apos;d like to leave you with actually four messages .
( music ) So you see , he played this note .
you maybe notice this scale bar , and it &apos;s 100 microns for the tower bridge and 20 microns for the fat man .
it worked brilliantly from the first test on , and it had the same resolution as systems which cost 60,000 euros , and we only spent 1,500 euros for the system , not including my salary , but that wouldn &apos;t add so much on its own .
( Applause )
if it leaks -- Bilbao did not leak .
( Laughter ) But my point is that ... and I call it the &quot; then what ? &quot;
and I think that &apos;s what I &apos;ve always been interested in , is that -- which is a personal kind of expression .
we sat down , and we had a drink of water and everybody was quiet .
they didn &apos;t help at all .
because when we think about reusing and recycling , metals , glass , things like that , can be recycled as many times as you like .
Jere@@ mi@@ ah : just go , count me out .
and this is what I think is the magic of fluorescence .
that &apos;s what the surgeon is saying in the operating room when the patient &apos;s on the table .
there &apos;s still cancer in your patient . &quot;
the molecule passes through and gets excre@@ ted .
we published our results in the proce@@ edings of the National Academy of Sciences and in Nature Bi@@ ot@@ echnology .
the eventual goal is that we &apos;ll get this into patients .
we &apos;re focused on adding drugs , adding growth factors , killing nerves that are causing problems and not the surrounding tissue .
it requires one team for the breakthrough and another team to get the breakthrough accepted and adopted .
and we &apos;ve go to do something about it .
it &apos;s basically a measure of how many tigers , to@@ ads , ticks or whatever on average of biomass of various species are around .
this is not illegal stuff , this is basically business as usual , which causes climate-@@ changing emissions , which have an economic cost .
but the thing is to do a lot more of that .
and the sad thing is that , as these coral reefs are lost -- and scientists tell us that any level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere above 350 parts per million is too dangerous for the survival of these reefs -- we are not only risking the extinction of the entire coral species , the warm water corals , we &apos;re not only risking a fourth of all fish species which are in the oceans , but we are risking the very lives and livelihoods of more than 500 million people who live in the developing world in poor countries .
you can &apos;t put the self-driving car before the roads .
so let &apos;s explore this .
film can bring visions of the future to us here in the present .
Hom@@ ar@@ o C@@ ant@@ u : and I &apos;m Hom@@ ar@@ o .
so here &apos;s the next challenge .
the bumper of the car hit my throat , slicing it open .
at that point , I had gained four pounds , so I was 68 pounds .
( Laughter ) So eventually , what went on is , they decided that , well , I need to learn to speak .
every time I approached the corner or the curb , I would panic .
eventually I became a published cartoonist , writing and drawing comic books for a living .
but again , I was wrong .
for instance , after I finished a problem on the board , I &apos;d clap my hands , and the board would magically erase .
a lot of innovative teachers began bringing comics into their classrooms to experiment .
now , I imagine that there are some Stephen King fans in the audience here , and I &apos;m one of them .
31 minutes .
but if you take into consideration that at the peak of the victory garden movement last century , 40 percent of all produce was coming from gardens .
we &apos;re in the midst now of talking about another stimulus package .
first , universal access : forget about it .
that &apos;s the method , basically .
you look for a statistically significant sample , and then try to figure out what the health impact of the medicine is in different locations , in different demographic groups ...
one very important hurdle here , politically , is that we have to make sure that we have long-term visibility for innovators , that innovators know that the money is actually there , and so we need governments to fund the Health Impact Fund , because only governments can make predictable commitments for a long period of time .
and of course consider images that can be sensory patterns , visual , such as you &apos;re having right now in relation to the stage and me , or auditory images , as you are having now in relation to my words .
we own our minds .
this , of course , is a visual map that I &apos;m showing you , but this applies to any kind of map -- auditory , for example , in relation to sound frequencies , or to the maps that we construct with our skin in relation to an object that we palp@@ ate .
so what about with our approach , adding the code ? and you can see that it &apos;s much better . not only can you tell that it &apos;s a baby &apos;s face , but you can tell that it &apos;s this baby &apos;s face , which is a really challenging task .
so one of the things you can do to our icons , just like paper , is crease them and fold them , just like paper . remember , you know , something for later .
a commitment device is a decision that you make with a cool head to bind yourself so that you don &apos;t do something regre@@ t@@ table when you have a hot head .
whereas if the present self saves a lot , the future self is delighted , where the income is close up near 100 percent .
the legs were swollen and the knees were stiff , so he needed a long preparation .
I met Mahmoud one year later .
I said , &quot; Okay . &quot;
that was my story . Thank you very much .
I &apos;ve spent the last decade subjec@@ ting myself to pain and humiliation , hopefully for a good cause , which is self-@@ improvement .
I was like a gla@@ zed doughnut for most of the year .
and as Dan Bu@@ ett@@ ner can tell you , having a strong social network is so crucial to our health .
so thank you very much .
as I was approaching my late 40s , when I would wake up in the morning , my first six thoughts would all be negative .
you realize you &apos;re still yourself -- maybe even more so .
this upward ascen@@ sion can happen even in the face of extreme physical challenges .
my own view , by the way , ladies and gentlemen , is that this is unlikely to be done by spawning more U.N. institutions .
when we read non-@@ fiction books , we &apos;re really being fed stories .
no , it has to be a conspiracy , people plotting together , because in a story , a story is about intention .
so let &apos;s not rely too much on others when we live on a continent that is filled with untapped talent .
the second stage was completed at the Penn State University main campus lab , which is where I extracted the chemicals , changed the P@@ H so I could run it through the equipment and separated the compounds I needed from the rest of the chicken .
and that is where the research began .
but if each one of us takes initiative in our own home , in our own school and in our own workplace , we can make a huge difference in air quality .
now four CO@@ M IS@@ A@@ F &apos;s later , we hear a different message : &quot; this cannot be won milit@@ arily .
prime Minister Rab@@ in said when he engaged the Oslo process , &quot; You don &apos;t make peace with your friends , you make peace with your enemies . &quot;
it &apos;s their right to fight . &quot;
I didn &apos;t want to believe her and at first , I didn &apos;t .
back at work , I handed over the urgent things that needed to be done while I was having more tests to see if my cancer had spread .
and I &apos;m pleased to say that the uptake of the toolkit is increasing .
making solid nuclear fuel is a complicated and expensive process .
by logical extension of this , if music is this universal force , then surely groups of musicians -- let &apos;s call them orchestras -- should reflect every aspect of the community .
we need your help , we need the global community to help us deliver this dream , so that this orchestra can be full steam ahead by summer 2012 .
it &apos;s seen as hypocrisy .
but today , in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page , that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page , in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer .
but it turns out to be illegal to print a child &apos;s drawing of Mic@@ ky Mouse onto a plate of sugar .
and policing copyright violations for children &apos;s birthday cakes was such a hass@@ le that the College B@@ ak@@ ery said , &quot; You know what , we &apos;re getting out of that business .
and you &apos;d think that would be a pretty big problem for a law , but Congress seems not to have let that bother them too much .
that was the level of rhetoric .
you don &apos;t have millions and millions of dollars , but you can call your representatives , and you can remind them that you vote , and you can ask not to be treated like a thief , and you can suggest that you would prefer that the Internet not be broken .
there was also recently a study done with CEOs in which they followed CEOs around for a whole week .
now choosing not to buy a jar of jam is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist@@ lines -- but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us even in very consequential decisions .
they &apos;re always worried they &apos;re going to lose shelf space .
the third technique : categor@@ ization .
I have talked about four techniques for miti@@ gating the problem of choice overload -- cut -- get rid of the ex@@ tran@@ eous alternatives ; concre@@ tize -- make it real ; categorize -- we can handle more categories , less choices ; condition for complexity .
it turns out that music@@ ologists -- a famous composer by the name of Arnold Scho@@ enberg -- thought of this in the 1930s , &apos; 40s and &apos; 50s .
( Laughter ) When you &apos;re listening to this piece of music , I im@@ pl@@ ore you : try and find some repetition .
( Applause )
the field of aviation uses more fuel than just about every other combined . we need to find an alternative .
well , I &apos;m not quite sure .
there is something about what it means to be you which defines you , and it &apos;s kind of permanent and un@@ changing .
the most kind of crude way in which we have it , are things like hor@@ os@@ copes .
you are the individuals you are , and you have this kind of core .
you have desires , maybe for a cookie , maybe for something that we don &apos;t want to talk about at 11 o &apos;clock in the morning in a school .
what it means is we have to understand what it is as something which has a history , has certain things that keep it together , but it &apos;s a process , it &apos;s fluid , it &apos;s forever changing .
so if we put this to work today , it would be very interesting .
and what the ac@@ equ@@ ia is is a sharing system for scarce water .
and contrary , with all due respect , to what L@@ le@@ w &#91; Cla@@ as@@ en &#93; said when he talked about blockchains and crypto@@ currencies yesterday , there is no tragedy of the commons .
and he also said that &quot; the great powers of the world have done wonders in giving us an industrial and military look , ... &quot;
but it &apos;s very hard to create that in standard ways .
I &apos;m not sure about you guys , but I &apos;ve had experiences when I &apos;ve walked into a store and I &apos;ve know exactly what I &apos;ve wanted and I &apos;ve searched everywhere for that perfect lamp that I know where I want to sit in my house and I just can &apos;t find the right thing , or that perfect piece of jewelry as a gift or for myself .
and I couldn &apos;t forgive myself for the countless , countless hours I had lost in negative thought -- all the time I had spent beating myself up for losing my marriage and not stopping the sexual abuse when I was a kid and career moves and this and this and this .
and I had all kinds of counting systems ready there in English , followed by German , followed by Spanish , followed by French .
and I knew I could do it .
first of all , you &apos;re going to hit obstacles .
I didn &apos;t pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do , which was call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself .
&quot; do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat ? &quot;
Oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes .
and the problem with escaping your day-to-day life is that you have to come home , eventually .
I had left ABC news and a career I loved at the age of 30 for business school , a path I knew almost nothing about .
and that was actually an excellent business , because we provided jobs for women all around our neighborhood .
because , as the World Economic Forum noted , smaller gender gaps are directly correlated with increased economic competi@@ tiveness .
and finally , there is no society anywhere in all the world that is not changed except by its most exceptional .
( Laughter ) &quot; You will find a job . take the leap . &quot;
it is time for us to aim higher when it comes to women , to invest more and to deploy our dollars to benefit women all around the world .
but we didn &apos;t realize just how pervasive this way of thinking extended to other functions in the warehouse .
but what effectively this approach is doing inside of the DC is turning it into a massively parallel processing engine .
here &apos;s a warehouse and we &apos;re thinking about parallel processing supercomputer architectures .
we think it &apos;s a more fulfilling way to fill orders .
and most of the time , he told me this story I &apos;m going to share with you now .
I stand for this soldier who suffered partial hearing loss and sustained permanent injuries to her leg , when she was hit by a rocket on a mission in Afghanistan .
it takes hard work , often behind the scenes .
Thank you very much .
because maybe we can g@@ lean information , not just how to move people up to the average , but move the entire average up in our companies and schools worldwide .
and if we can change the lens , not only can we change your happiness , we can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time .
and the first surgery of the day happened to be an ob@@ ste@@ tri@@ cal case .
and so it &apos;s not going to break very easily , but if it does , virtually every piece in this machine can be swapped out and replaced with a he@@ x wr@@ ench and a screw@@ driver .
well the answer is , if I drew it on a normal curve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that I &apos;m trying to graph , the graphs look sort of silly .
and there &apos;s nothing preceden@@ ted in the history of technology development of this kind of self-@@ feeding growth where you go by orders of magnitude every few years .
and we know that it just doesn &apos;t make too much sense to think out 30 , 50 years because everything &apos;s going to be so different that a simple extrapol@@ ation of what we &apos;re doing just doesn &apos;t make any sense at all .
some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin , and it went around sort of creating its little DNA information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because bacteria communicate .
and I think that that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of curve .
frankly , I felt trapped .
( Applause ) This is made possible because today , with design for manufacture and assembly , which uses light gauge steel frame construction , shipped and assembled on-site , we can decrease construction costs by 20 percent and environmental waste by 15 percent , saving time , money and keeping tons of waste out of landfills .
we shared the photo with our families like everyone does and soon after , my mom showed up at our house with a bag filled -- I &apos;m not exaggerating , it was like this high and it was filled , over@@ flowing with pink clothes and toys .
I want a balanced environment for her to explore and make sense of in her own way .
and we do all this in hopes that we model a healthy and empowered relationship with gender for our kid .
it &apos;s to be the mentor . you &apos;re not Luke Sky@@ walker , you &apos;re Yoda .
so this is where it gets kind of interesting : every tick mark here is when he made them laugh .
and so I feel like there &apos;s people in this room -- you got those little Su@@ av@@ itos baking spices and you &apos;re just like , &quot; You know , It &apos;s not that big a deal . &quot;
but my point is , if liberal democracy is the end of history , then there &apos;s a massive paradox or contradiction here .
the first is that people can &apos;t get access to these technologies because they can &apos;t afford them .
well , you can &apos;t just go into a community and pretend to change it , you need to look at a lot of factors .
now both of these kinds of cells can make the place cells fire .
now , there &apos;s a bunch of reasons why we send military personnel , rather than police , to do these jobs .
and since we &apos;ve already had so many problems with police use of nonlethal weapons in various ways , I thought it would be a good idea to look at some of those things and relate it to the military context .
now , when they introduced OC spray in Queensland , they were really explicit .
so I looked at all of the police shooting figures .
there were , in fact , only a couple of people who got shot in this episode .
she could come to work in her pajamas and nobody would care .
life necess@@ it@@ ates a universal world , however , we believe in the security of having a local identity .
sports teams work together : that magic , those game-@@ saving plays .
this is where I &apos;ve done a lot of my research over the years .
of course , in teaming , the stakes aren &apos;t always life and death .
for me to succeed , you must fail .
and you all know that if you are going to determine whether you &apos;re related to your brother or your sister , you can &apos;t do it by looking at differences .
but they did look at these three and they said , &quot; These are three different dinosaurs , and D@@ rac@@ ore@@ x is probably the most primitive of them .
when you have a little museum , you have little dinosaurs .
so Tor@@ osaurus is extinct .
if you &apos;re just going to be there for a short time , then you should exploit .
but there &apos;s another group of experts who perhaps thought even harder about this problem , and they would say one of these questions is more important than the others .
you have limited capacity , and you need to try and get in there the things that you &apos;re most likely to need so that you can get to them as quickly as possible .
these aren &apos;t the con@@ c@@ essions that we make when we can &apos;t be rational -- they &apos;re what being rational means .
having learned that , I was intrigued .
I already had a profession as a teacher , but I went ahead anyway and sent an email off to the program , explaining that I was a teacher of the deaf , wondering if I could take a few classes with them and perhaps share their lessons with my students .
on Fridays , there would be field training -- labs -- off-@@ campus , and occasionally , we would have weekend training at a military base .
every cade@@ t has a mentor .
I &apos;ve given him this sign because of the scar he has here .
he is the highest-@@ ranking military officer and principal military advisor to President Obama and Secretary of Defense Gates .
I could take the classes , audit them , and that &apos;s all .
we &apos;ve taken this title of &quot; leader &quot; and treat it as something that one day we &apos;re going to deserve .
as soon as I did , you got this incredibly severe look on your face , looked at my mom and dad and said , &apos; Look at that ! look at that !
that &apos;s a four-@@ fold increase .
scientists agree now .
but we also start out as aquatic organisms .
never heard of it .
and , by God , film was expensive .
so , as you can see I &apos;ve been thinking this way for many years .
fancy one more drawing ?
here we go . right .
they &apos;re also harmless plan@@ k@@ ton@@ -@@ feeding animals .
so they were incredibly important animals .
probably the best-@@ documented basking shark fishery in the world is that from A@@ chill Island .
whereas I &apos;m a field person , I get panic attacks if I have to spend too many hours in a lab with a white coat on .
so , L@@ es No@@ ble in A@@ ber@@ de@@ en kind of found this a bit unbelievable , really .
so he did another study using micros@@ at@@ ellit@@ es , which is much more expensive , much more time-consuming , and to his surprise , came up with almost identical results .
so what it tells us , actually , is that there &apos;s actually a risk of extinction of this species because its population is so small .
I don &apos;t know . I don &apos;t believe it .
but Haiti provided us with something else unprecedented .
it has been used to signal early warning in advance of weather@@ -related disasters .
so they decided to call it oil sands .
I hope that you will all , if you &apos;ve been moved by this presentation , join with the growing international community to get Canada to step up to its responsibilities , to convince Canada to go back to being a climate change champion instead of a climate change villain , and to say no to the tar sands , and yes to a clean energy future for all .
the lightbulb , for all practical purposes , is more or less round .
and they &apos;ll be able to restore their al@@ t@@ ars and to worship their gods in their own way , in their own place .
and it enters now another story .
and so in Isa@@ i@@ ah , we have the wonderful texts giving all the credit of this , not to Mar@@ duk but to the Lord God of Israel -- the Lord God of Israel who also called Cyrus by name , also takes Cyrus by the hand and talks of him shepher@@ ding his people .
( Laughter ) Have at it you radical ba@@ stards . the field is yours .
and we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient Indian epic &quot; The Maha@@ b@@ har@@ ata . &quot;
and I don &apos;t mean wizards and dragons , I mean the kind of childhood magic , those ideas that we all har@@ bored as children .
this is a map that grows and glows and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book .
so let &apos;s think about how we manage our money .
no one .
what is the default setting if people do nothing , if they keep procrastinating , if they don &apos;t check the boxes ?
they &apos;re really mad .
this is a real difference .
this is just one example .
how many of you feel you have a solid plan for the future when it comes to post-@@ retirement decisions .
all the adults knew the risks .
but I do remember the lights on the oil rig off the Malay@@ sian coast and the young man who collapsed and died , the journey &apos;s end too much for him , and the first apple I tasted , given to me by the men on the rig .
first@@ borns across history have tended to be bigger and healthier than later borns , in part , because of the head start they got on food in an area in which it could be scarce .
K equals the number of people in your household , and X equals the number of dy@@ ads .
this overpopulation of relationships makes fights unavoidable .
there &apos;s several examples up on the screen of situations where doctors are looking to implant devices inside of people , and all of these devices now , it &apos;s standard that they communicate wirelessly , and I think this is great , but without a full understanding of trustworthy computing , and without understanding what attac@@ kers can do and the security risks from the beginning , there &apos;s a lot of danger in this .
now you might say , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s silly . &quot;
they were able to compromise every single one of the pieces of software that controlled every single one of the wireless capabilities of the car .
what was interesting is , by videot@@ aping on a bus , they were able to produce exactly what people on their smartphones were typing , and then they had a surprising result , which is that their software had not only done it for their target , but other people who accidentally happened to be in the picture , they were able to produce what those people had been typing , and that was kind of an accidental artifact of what their software was doing .
( music ) So &quot; N@@ yan Cat &quot; is a lo@@ oped animation with lo@@ oped music .
and eventually , the deep sea floor would come into view .
and so what did we find ?
and as I say , it could be a much larger number .
now there are a group of scientists living in Texas , working in the Gulf of Mexico who decided really as a labor of love to pull together all the knowledge they could about biodiversity in the Gulf of Mexico .
if we look at distributions , in fact distributions change dramatically .
if you were to suck all the water out of the ocean , this is what you &apos;d be left behind with , and that &apos;s the biomass of life on the sea floor .
we actually know the fishes better than we do any other group in the ocean other than marine mammals .
and this is about shifting baseline .
the bottom is transformed from , in this case , a hard bottom or soft coral into a mu@@ ddy mess .
we transform the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
they become rarer because we fish them .
that &apos;s all true .
so when does this transition begin ?
we see the Occupy protests , we see spiraling debt crises , we see growing inequality , we see money &apos;s influence on politics , we see resource constraint , food and oil prices .
after the bombing of Pearl Harbor , it just took four days for the government to ban the production of civilian cars and to redirect the auto industry , and from there to ra@@ tioning of food and energy .
when we think about the future I paint , of course we should feel a bit of fear .
we have achieved remarkable things since working out how to grow food some 10,000 years ago .
( Applause )
we truly are living in an extraordinary time .
and on this curve , riding on Moore &apos;s Law , are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies available to all of us .
but the King of Si@@ am , he was fed with aluminum utensils .
he took a famous photo . what was it called ?
last month , I had the pleasure of announcing with Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m Foundation something called the $ 10 million Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m Tri@@ cor@@ der X Prize .
so his algorithm essentially tells these robots how to autonomously build cubic structures from trus@@ s-@@ like elements .
so I couldn &apos;t figure out for the life of me why we were supposed to be so row@@ dy , or why we had to spell this word incorrectly .
we sat in rows of desks like this , and we did most of our work pretty autonomously .
now , of course , this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating -- and case in point , is Steve Wo@@ z@@ ni@@ ak famously coming together with Steve Jobs to start Apple Computer -- but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people it is the air that they breathe .
much better for everybody to go off by themselves , generate their own ideas freed from the distor@@ tions of group dynamics , and then come together as a team to talk them through in a well-@@ managed environment and take it from there .
( Applause ) Another round of applause for José Andr@@ és .
I actually learned about this from my grandmother .
and I remember this just like it happened yesterday .
and then she said , &quot; I just need you to promise me three things , Bryan . &quot;
I said , &quot; Okay , Mama . &quot;
we &apos;re looking at some very interesting developments in our work .
that when we actually don &apos;t care about these difficult things , the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated .
I gave her my whole rap , and when I finished she looked at me and she said , &quot; M@@ mm mmm mmm . &quot;
( Applause ) And I put in my motion that there was prosecu@@ torial mis@@ conduct and police mis@@ conduct and judicial mis@@ conduct .
sometimes you can make some horrible choices with them .
yet , on the surface it just seemed to be depic@@ ting his historical lineage of what went on .
here were all these seemingly disparate events and dialogues that just were chron@@ ologically telling the history of him , but underneath it was a constant , a guid@@ eline , a road map .
it can &apos;t be artificially ev@@ oked .
here at age two and a half years , he thinks he can protect his two and a half-@@ day-@@ old little sister .
pro@@ curing software usually takes a couple of years .
and that &apos;s great news , because , it turns out , we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
and like a lot of people , I thought government was basically about getting people elected to office .
so one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; opos@@ sum in my tr@@ ash@@ can . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
and what &apos;s under that is what we call bureaucracy .
and those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better .
we all defend our social justice education because we learned about Martin Luther King Jr .
WG : every day , we are still blown away by people &apos;s experiences , by the complexity of our collective racial reality .
here &apos;s a video showing -- ( Laughter ) yes , we did that ! -- showing the first few seconds of conflicted belief , where people could feel for a moment what -- ( Laughter ) Yes !
( Applause )
this still happens to me standing right here .
the entire human race , in many ways , is like my family .
&quot; well , I &apos;m interested in this . &quot;
I love you more than Mary , Jane , Susie , Pen@@ elope , In@@ grid , Gertrude , Gre@@ tel -- I was on a German exchange program then .
but then , there are some of you who , in spite of all these excuses , you will find , you will find your passion .
but then , you were born . &quot;
your brain is made out of 100 billion cells , called neurons .
so what if we do an experiment ?
( music ) &#91; How many universes are there ? &#93; sometimes when I &apos;m on a long plane flight , I gaze out at all those mountains and deserts and try to get my head around how vast our Earth is .
it doesn &apos;t . it &apos;s actually the opposite .
I want to take you from shallow water down to the deep water , and hopefully , like me , you &apos;ll see some things that get you hooked on exploring planet Earth .
there &apos;s 47 other people , the teamwork on that ship , making sure that these people are okay .
look at that thing , just fla@@ iling his arms around .
when I tell people that I &apos;m trying to develop a contraceptive pill for men , the response usually varies along gender lines .
a tool like this , coupled with a male contraceptive , could greatly increase the role for men in preventing unintended pregnancy .
E@@ rat@@ os@@ thenes was the third librarian at the great Library of Alexandria , and he made many contributions to science .
this was F@@ iz@@ e@@ au &apos;s solution to sending discrete pulses of light .
JH : so note how Brad@@ ley &apos;s petty , mor@@ alistic self just dies on the way up the staircase .
the main argument against group selection has always been that , well sure , it would be nice to have a group of cooper@@ ators , but as soon as you have a group of cooper@@ ators , they &apos;re just going to get taken over by free-@@ riders , individuals that are going to exploit the hard work of the others .
every man is a piece of the continent , a part of the main . &quot;
you can see all types of resolution . from here , I can slowly pan the image over .
shame is that thing .
how many of you would be willing to say that ?
it &apos;s not a profound philosophy , but it works for us .
we call the resulting parts &quot; fair@@ ings , &quot; because they &apos;re named after the panels on a motorcycle that turn it from a mechanical thing into a sculptural thing .
the proof of concept works great , we &apos;re finding it ; we &apos;ll get there .
he nailed that part .
so think about it .
it &apos;s a complex operation .
it &apos;s having the imagination to try and predict or project where the building or where the urban space or where the landscape is going to be located , how it &apos;s going to be used , what are the operations , what are the activities that are going to take place in that space .
they &apos;re symbolic , they seem emb@@ le@@ matic with modernity and development .
and here you can see methane , if that &apos;s the way you &apos;re going to go , that there &apos;s plenty of methane -- natural gas is methane , methane and natural gas are inter@@ changeable -- but if you decide that you &apos;re going to use some methane -- and I &apos;m gone , so it &apos;s up to you -- but we do have plenty of methane hydrates .
you cannot do a wind deal under six dollars an M@@ C@@ F .

whatever it is you are struggling to remember , it is not poised on the tip of your tongue , not even lurking in some obscure corner of your sp@@ leen .
who could whis@@ k away the thought of the one unlikely mouse p@@ adding along a cold water pipe behind the fl@@ oral wall@@ paper , gripping a single wooden match between the needles of his teeth ?
and who could fail to notice , lit up in the blazing insulation , the tiny looks of wonder@@ ment on the faces of his fellow mice -- one-time inhabitants of what once was your house in the country ?
and we have some wizard technology which I think has worked really well , and over the course of the time I &apos;ve worked in intensive care , the death rate for males in Australia has halved , and intensive care has had something to do with that .
one in a hundred .
you know , historically , we didn &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s an amazing picture .
so that &apos;s the little idea .
I want to make it absolutely crystal clear to you all , I hate euthan@@ asia . I think it &apos;s a side@@ show .
it depri@@ ves euthan@@ asia of its oxygen supply .
so this is what happens in the world , if we play the entire world .
well , you see the nice story of getting richer and getting healthier -- everyone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide .
there is no one who has done it so far .
Micro@@ -@@ credits gave her the bicycle , you know .
on the global level , we have to have more than our own thing .
so today , I work at the New York Times .
so we built this system called Open Pa@@ ths , which lets people upload their iPhone data and broker relationships with researchers to share that data , to donate that data to people that can actually put it to use .
because what we do in the tool , inadvertently , is we put these pieces of data into a human context .
Vol@@ ta &apos;s battery works at room temperature .
it is this that caught and held my attention to the point that I became obsessed with inventing a battery that could capture this gigantic economy of scale .
I felt the thrill of realization when I knew I &apos;d come upon the answer .
you know , I &apos;ve got to tell you , one of the greatest benefits of being a professor : colored chalk .
what I didn &apos;t tell David at the time was I myself wasn &apos;t convinced it would work .
we call that the pizza .
now these two ideas are connected more than you may realize , because when you remove the fear of failure , impossible things suddenly become possible .
and in part , that testing feels an appropriate part of achieving something great .
it can hover and rotate .
this is the first time a human has controlled a robot with thought alone .
this green goo is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life .
they were able to work together because they &apos;re connected by the Internet .
and more so than most , he saw the highs and the lows , the celebrations and the disap@@ pointments .
I have a couple of questions .
I wish to go to school . &quot;
and for the next three years , her fate will be having sex with him every day , as a favor for getting her in school .
teen prostitution is at its peak .
several years ago , a few friends of mine decided we needed to bridge the disconnect between our generation and the generation of young women .
but not only did they do that , they went to those who were running for seats to ask them , &quot; What is it that you will give the girls of this community when you win ? &quot;
and when the girls started engaging him , he was very hostile towards them .
( Laughter ) But wait , this is actually my favorite project .
( Applause )
there are tales of creation and loss , death and resurrection , and obstacles that must be overcome .
so the other type of access : financial .
a lot of people say , &quot; Well , you know , we should make the world a better place , &quot; or , &quot; Yeah , we should all feel good now . &quot;
it needs to be -- and this is where it gets exciting in terms of working s@@ warm@@ wise -- it needs to be inclusive .
obviously , not everything went according to plan , but that &apos;s a different thing .
so , having fun is more than just having a pin@@ ball machine in the office .
I &apos;m a woman who loves getting texts who &apos;s going to tell you that too many of them can be a problem .
they text and shop and go on Facebook during classes , during presentations , actually during all meetings .
human relationships are rich and they &apos;re messy and they &apos;re demanding .
and we clean them up with technology .
and as that woman took comfort in her robot companion , I didn &apos;t find it amazing ; I found it one of the most wrenching , complicated moments in my 15 years of work .
and I ask myself , &quot; Why have things come to this ? &quot;
because the moment that people are alone , even for a few seconds , they become anxious , they panic , they fid@@ get , they reach for a device .
if we &apos;re not able to be alone , we &apos;re going to be more lonely .
that we listen when technology says it will take something complicated and promises something simpler .
so descend into Hu@@ au@@ t@@ la Pl@@ ateau in Mexico .
we would not do this today unless we were doing it for film .
now I remember that term really well for two reasons .
for those who have never seen this story , Jim Cameron produced a really wonderful IM@@ A@@ X movie couple of years ago , called &quot; Ali@@ ens of the Deep . &quot;
this is part of DE@@ PT@@ H@@ X &apos;s mission .
the next step after that is to test it in Antar@@ tica and then , if the funding continues and NASA has the resolution to go , we could potentially launch by 2016 , and by 2019 we may have the first evidence of life off this planet .
it will leave us no further along in the general expansion of humanity into space than we were 50 years ago .
there is a place where you can .
if we &apos;re going to get that , and make that gas station possible , we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space .
we &apos;re living in one of the most exciting times in history .
talk about space always seems to be hung on ambi@@ gui@@ ties of purpose and timing .
we &apos;re in the middle of the process .
and sure enough , somebody from M@@ CA Universal calls our legal department to see if they can maybe look into buying the rights to the image , just in case they might want to use it .
so we learned the majority of anatom@@ ic classes taught , they do not have a cada@@ ver dissection lab .
then it &apos;s going to show inside .
we &apos;ve literally consumed an entire river in North America for irrigation .
how do we feed a growing world without destroying the planet ?
sounds like the r@@ ust of shack@@ les locking their way onto my degree .
and I handed out these postcards randomly on the streets of Washington , D.C. , not knowing what to expect .
F@@ W : sometimes I share that information , yeah .
this is the way bonobos do it . bonobos do everything with sex .
otherwise they wouldn &apos;t be pulling so hard .
and so they &apos;re bringing in the box .
now you &apos;re going to get a more interesting picture , because now one of the two chimps has been fed .
and so what we did in that case -- we do these studies in Thailand for Josh P@@ lot@@ nik -- is we have an apparatus around which there is a rope , a single rope .
couples like this one , and this one , and this one , and , yes , even this one .
empowering parents -- it doesn &apos;t need justification .
so , Melinda , in the last few years I &apos;ve heard a lot of smart people say something to the effect of , &quot; We don &apos;t need to worry about the population issue anymore .
I haven &apos;t got to worry about it , which is a rebirth for me .
everyone needs to understand what is assumed and what is not .
so in the end , I went after private investors , just gave up on it .
a mammalian fetus , if it loses a limb during the first tri@@ mester of pregnancy , will re-@@ grow that limb .
and that idea was that the small intestine of a pig , if you threw away all the cells , and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active , may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself .
the horse just has another nostri@@ l that &apos;s developed because of a riding accident .
and I &apos;ll show you the 15 million dollar picture .
this is clinically relevant today .
so you could go in , you could get your tum@@ my-@@ tu@@ ck .
that didn &apos;t seem to prevent the doctors from being frantically busy in their days , as he explained .
we can &apos;t guarantee that everybody will live a long and healthy life .
now a system , however , when things start to come together , you realize it has certain skills for acting and looking that way .
this was bigger than a drug .
those planets which are much closer to a star like the Sun would be so hot that our form of life wouldn &apos;t exist .
and we manipulated how much money we gave them ; some people got this slip of paper and five dollars , some got this slip of paper and 20 dollars .
people who spent money on others got happier ; people who spent it on themselves , nothing happened .
and do you know what ? it would just barely be visible .
is it one car ? two ?
you use separate lanes , dedicated lanes .
so spending much less money and doing it much faster , you can really change the way people move .
so I want to make two points here tonight about favelas .
let me get you the fleet of our waste collection trucks .
I think it &apos;s possible , if we think about that intuition , and think about that fact , that maybe that explains some of this low behavior change .
so the other thing that I think we learn here is that AIDS is not going to fix itself .
Botswana is a place with a lot of AIDS , Egypt is a place without a lot of AIDS .
and we can go and we can try to have pre-@@ emp@@ tive preventive measures there .
it &apos;s been replicated in Kenya , and Tanzania , and South Africa and many other places .
but now I want to actually also question that .
but there was actually something else that happened in Uganda in this period .
and so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hotline .
JS : again .
JS : OK . wet hands .
( Applause ) Audience : shake .
how ? as soon as it starts , you just tear it off .
JS : now , let &apos;s all say it together . shake . fold .
when we think of games , there &apos;s all kinds of things .
but we think about games as fun , and that &apos;s completely reasonable , but let &apos;s just think about this .
I said , &quot; Yeah , you can play a game , &quot; and I give her a bunch of these , and I tell her to paint them in different families .
so she gave me a look that only a daughter of a game designer would give a mother , and as we &apos;re going across the ocean , following these rules , she realizes that she &apos;s rolling pretty high , and she says to me , &quot; We &apos;re not going to make it . &quot;
it &apos;s an expression of love . it &apos;s an expression of -- God , I &apos;m totally choking up way more than I thought .
it &apos;s already taken up by landscape and by sculptures .
also last year , BMW announced this carbon fiber electric car , they said that its carbon fiber is paid for by needing fewer batteries .
Au@@ di claimed it &apos;s going to beat them both by a year .
but first we ought to be capturing bigger , cheaper savings that are normally ignored and are not in the textbooks .
and this sort of thing gives utility executives the he@@ e@@ be@@ e-@@ je@@ e@@ bees and it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams .
in contrast , the net addi@@ tions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity and the orders behind those keep fading because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk .
in fact in this country , no new nuclear power plant has been able to raise any private construction capital , despite seven years of 100-@@ plus percent subsidies .
so how else could we replace the coal-fired power plants ?
that is how , for example , four German states in 2010 were 43 to 52 percent wind powered .
big discoveries are protected by public incre@@ dul@@ ity . &quot;
both of them , after all , are in exactly the same stage of life .
I think psychological value is great , to be absolutely honest .
you have to go in and have a cost-benefit analysis , a feasibility study , an RO@@ I study and so forth .
try this quick thought experiment : imagine a restaurant that serves Michel@@ in-@@ star@@ red food , but where the restaurant smells of sewage and there &apos;s human feces on the floor .
that &apos;s like trying to improve the food in a restaurant that stin@@ ks .
but I &apos;m British ; that &apos;s the way we like it .
and when it finds one of those phrases , it grabs the sentence up to the period , and then automatically tries to de@@ duce the age , gender and geographical location of the person that wrote that sentence .
and I &apos;ll show you a glimpse of how this information is then visualized . so this is We Feel Fine .
the next movement is called mobs .
and then if I go over here , the list begins to scroll , and there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected .
and it &apos;s kind of the ze@@ itgeist view at this level of the world &apos;s current mythology over the last couple of months .
and in fact , as man began to understand more his complex and ambi@@ valent nature , harmony grew more complex to reflect it .
what happens when the music stops ?
and what &apos;s more , I &apos;m really lucky , because I get to share that with millions of people worldwide .
and eventually we got lucky .
but at 15,000 feet , it &apos;s tough .
some of the world &apos;s astronomers have telescopes nearby .
you can smell the o@@ at@@ meal rais@@ in cookie that he &apos;s about to shovel into his mouth .
at the other end of the spectrum , I met this guy .
this is Kim Pe@@ ek , he was the basis for D@@ us@@ tin Hoff@@ man &apos;s character in the movie &quot; Rain Man . &quot;
these technologies have made our modern world possible , but they &apos;ve also changed us .
and I was fascinated , I wanted to know how do these guys do it .
the person who was told his name is Baker is less likely to remember the same word than the person was told his job is a baker .
let &apos;s say that you &apos;ve been invited to TED center stage to give a speech , and you want to do it from memory , and you want to do it the way that C@@ ic@@ ero would have done it , if he had been invited to TEDx@@ Rome 2,000 years ago .
they work because they &apos;re based on some pretty basic principles about how our brains work .
how do you celebrate entrepreneurship when everything &apos;s free ?
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t believe our species can survive unless we fix this .
it &apos;s effectively the default page when you ask a website for something and it can &apos;t find it .
why did we set up these experiments ?
so , guess what ?
I mean -- I don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s 75 percent .
so most of us put ourselves above average on most of these abilities .
the average likelihood is only 30 percent , &quot; the next time around they would say , &quot; Well maybe my likelihood is about 35 percent . &quot;
so you see that because of the way we perceive quantities , as the war drags on , the number of soldiers committed to it and the casualties will increase not lin@@ early -- like 10,000 , 11,000 , 12,000 -- but exponentially -- 10,000 , later 20,000 , later 40,000 .
the repeated infection will scar your eyelids so that they contract and they turn inside out .
but of course , that only gives them temporary respite , because they just grow back more vicious than before .
it took us three years , but we went through 29 countries , and we taught local health workers to go district by district , and they examined the eyelids of over two and a half million people .
these are mainly countries which are in conflict -- places like Yemen , South Sudan -- where it &apos;s very difficult to work .
and a couple of months before I met her , she &apos;d had the operation .
as a college student , I went on an expedition across the Atlantic with a team of scientists using a high-powered laser to measure microscopic algae .
but nobody had paid much attention to it until we launched a nationwide study to understand the problem .
Colorado became the first state in the nation to limit methane pollution ; California followed suit , and the public joined in .
I remember one day my best friend Brian was working on a project .
then through a series of steps , he &apos;d move them and they &apos;d be standing in the doorway with the door open , and they &apos;d be looking in there .
about that time , he was at the d@@ .@@ school at Stanford taking classes .
and they will return to their communities and model the best of human flourishing .
often the queens mate more than once .
it &apos;s not due to the experience of older , wiser ants .
and they can use that tas@@ k-@@ specific odor in cu@@ tic@@ ular hydrocarbons -- they can use that in their brief anten@@ nal contacts to somehow keep track of the rate at which they &apos;re meeting ants of certain tasks .
twelve years ago , I was in the street writing my name to say , &quot; I exist . &quot;
and we keep sending more every day .
they really make Inside Out their own project .
these projects took thousands of actions in one year , making hundreds of thousands of people participating , creating millions of views .
so , I &apos;m going to start off with kind of the buzz@@ kill a little bit .
now , there was nothing particularly special about 2010 , because , on average , 31 and a half million people are displaced by natural disasters every single year .
the bottom line is that from their tin@@ y-@@ scale existence , these tiny microbes have a very large-scale power to control how our ocean smells , how it tastes , how it feels and how it looks .
the basic idea behind microflui@@ dic@@ s is that you can use nan@@ of@@ abri@@ cation techniques to recreate or mimic the conditions bacteria experience at their own tiny scale in the ocean .
the colored tu@@ bing is where bacteria and seawater flow in and out of the device .
but is that really the case ?
in my organization we now do this on a regular basis to identify the causes of outbreaks that are unclear exactly what causes them .
and while the hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological dark matter are really only in their infancy , there &apos;s a very , very exciting possibility that exists : that buried in this life , in this genetic information , are signatures of as of yet uni@@ denti@@ fied life .
so we were careful with that .
this is in 1960 .
( Applause ) And these are countries from United States here , with $ 40,000 per capita , France , Russia , Iran , Mexico , Turkey , Algeria , Indonesia , India and all the way to Bangladesh and Vietnam , which has less than five percent of the income per person of the United States and the same amount of babies per woman .
it has happened across the world .
they are quite useful for educational purposes .
each card box is one billion people .
then the old will die .
and let me show you something else .
but you know what ? you don &apos;t have to take my word for it .
in Thailand people who use drugs , or are merely suspected of using drugs , are placed in detention centers , like the one you see here , where they are supposed to clean up .
Re@@ pe@@ aling a law isn &apos;t easy , and it &apos;s particularly difficult when it relates to tou@@ chy subjects like drugs and sex .
the law , on the other hand , can seem remote , ar@@ cane , the stuff of specialists , but it isn &apos;t .
and the important thing to remember is that this simulation is a good one .
so I couldn &apos;t wait to get started to work on this , so I could introduce Kevin to my robot .
we started working with Pi@@ eter and his students .
and how do we make these tools , these editors , something that are just as fun as the game itself ?
we have very simple weather systems , simple geology .
so here &apos;s our little solar system , as we pull away from our melted planet here .
and now , because I &apos;m actually the one here , I can get out of the UF@@ O and walk up , and they should be wor@@ shipping me at this point as a god .
and I think by giving kids toys like this and letting them replay dynamics , very long-term dynamics over the short term , and getting some sense of what we &apos;re doing now , what it &apos;s going to be like in 100 years , I think probably is the most effective thing I can be doing to help the world .
that &apos;s how wide the plantation would have to be , given these assumptions .
it &apos;s actually a bigger footprint if we take into account the embodied energy in the stuff we import into our country as well .
up and to the right : bigger population density and higher per capita consumption .
so , for example , the middle line there , 0.1 watts per square meter , is the energy consumption per unit area of Saudi Arabia , Norway , Mexico in purple , and Bangladesh 15 years ago .
so , let &apos;s now say why this is relevant .
so here come some renewables .
here &apos;s a photograph of a consultation exercise in full swing in the little town of Pen@@ ic@@ u@@ i@@ k just outside Edinburgh , and you can see the children of Pen@@ ic@@ u@@ i@@ k celebrating the burning of the eff@@ i@@ gy of the windmill .
well , the laws of physics are written up there , which describe how the power consumption for heating is driven by the things you can control .
this was the most difficult question I &apos;ve been asked .
they said the stores who sold the guns and the owners who bought them were responsible should anything bad happen .
I don &apos;t know . listen , I &apos;m no gun control expert .
please teach your family , teach your community , your city council , your state legisl@@ ature .
( Applause ) Now , let &apos;s think about this for a minute .
only then would my peers see that I deserved to be there as much as they did .
I found that he , like me , believed in creating a more just society .
and the next thing you know , there were hands on her , and she was being moved out of the way .
so my fellow women and our gentle men , as we are here together within this particular window of this large-scale movement towards women &apos;s equality , and as we envision a future that does not yet exist , we both have different invitations .
but really , fundamentally , safety comes in the design of the system that you &apos;re going to fly people on , and so we &apos;ve been working for years , actually , almost a decade , on this technology .
he doesn &apos;t have to say a word .
( Laughter ) What &apos;s the business logic of doing this when you invested all that in that incredible technology , and now you &apos;re just going to something much bigger . why ?
we could have tossed that engine and built an entirely new engine for the Falcon 9 .
( Laughter ) CA : I mean . G@@ w@@ yn@@ ne , come on , this is awesome , but it &apos;s crazy , right ?
but under the surface was a very different reality .
( Applause ) Now people have raised some real concerns about what the rise of Islamist parties means for women .
but really , it means &quot; excellence . &quot;
and with that , I thank you .
I mean , who knows , but suppose it happens .
and I kept waiting for the Men in Black to show up . right ?
they &apos;re not building transmitters .
they &apos;re the ones you find on the kitchen counter@@ top .
well , let me suggest to you that SETI obviously can &apos;t solve the problem , but it can address the problem .
so that &apos;s one thing . the other thing is , it &apos;s exciting science .
I remember when a guy came to our high school , actually , it was actually my junior high school . I was in sixth grade .
in fact , my last comments to these kids , at the end I said , &quot; You know , you kids are smarter than the people I work with . &quot; now - ( Laughter ) They didn &apos;t even care about that .
that &apos;s a Japanese ATM , the fingerprint template is stored inside the mobile phone .
and within these galaxies you get these enormous dust clouds .
and that &apos;s the purpose of the universe ; and then it flat-@@ lines , it doesn &apos;t get any better .
and by the way , as you do this , you can image it in two colors , which means you can download this information as binary code directly into a computer .
but when you see an increase of that order of magnitude in a condition , either you &apos;re not measuring it right or there &apos;s something going on very quickly , and it may be evolution in real time .
and I didn &apos;t think this when Steve G@@ ull@@ ans and I started writing together .
( Laughter ) So he sat me down , and he warned me .
the arrow shows you the long axis of the skeleton .
but the only difference is that the fibers are arranged differently .
( Laughter ) So what I want you to do when you go home is think about this , and think about how powerful our cells are .
and this pressure forces the seawater through a membrane .
and this , in terms of magnesium and the amount of water that I just mentioned , equ@@ ates to a $ 4.5 billion mining industry for Singapore -- a place that doesn &apos;t have any natural resources .
and those services can cost in excess of 60,000 to 80,000 dollars a year .
and we just can &apos;t afford that missed opportunity , because children with autism become adults with autism .
even in stories on gender@@ -based violence , men get an overwhelming majority of print space and airtime .
what we &apos;re told in terms of arguments against leaving this country is that the fate of the women is primary .
&quot; doing that , acting by design , is what we all should be doing .
the song is just a given .
it &apos;s what we &apos;re supposed to do somehow .
we &apos;re supposed to do things by design .
I did love some great designs as I was growing up : the HP 3@@ 5@@ S calculator -- God , I loved that thing . Oh God , I wish I had one .
we sat there and compared wheels and tires and spo@@ kes and tubes .
in that clinic , even today , there are two social workers for 24,000 pediatric patients , which is better than a lot of the clinics out there .
so it &apos;s a brutal winter in the Northeast , your kid has asthma , your heat just got turned off , and of course you &apos;re in the waiting room of the ER , because the cold air triggered your child &apos;s asthma .
but he said this , &quot; Rebecca , when you have a vision , you have an obligation to realize that vision .
the film that changed my life is a 195@@ 1 film by Vit@@ tori@@ o De S@@ ica , &quot; Mir@@ acle in Milan . &quot;
I had seen the film on the occasion of my father &apos;s 50th birthday .
six thousand reviews each school week v@@ ying for the honor of being review of the week .
I have an aunt who is a wonderful storyteller .
what are these gays up to ?
the U.S. Constitution is the gay agenda .
he has a 4.@@ 0 .
( Laughter ) And this one here ?
and your front foot , the way it grabs it -- I &apos;d seen someone slide on the back of the board like that , and I was like , &quot; How can I get it over ? &quot;
oops -- ( Laughter ) Mental note right there .
notice how the board flipped and spun this way , both axes .
in fact , I know this is rotten to say , they &apos;re my friends , but a couple of them actually don &apos;t look that comfortable on their board .
every single one of these guys , you look at them , you can see a silhou@@ ette of them , and you realize , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s him , that &apos;s Has@@ lam , that &apos;s Kos@@ ton , there &apos;s these guys , these are the guys . &quot;
( Applause ) So you &apos;ve really reinvented yourself in the past , from freestyle to street , and , I think it was about four years ago you officially retired .
( Laughter ) A time for in@@ conveni@@ ences , mi@@ sh@@ aps , year@@ nings .
a time for even gri@@ mmer stuff than that , like in last April &apos;s New Yorker magazine .
sure you were , because you &apos;ve prepared your entire life for this historic quad@@ ren@@ ni@@ al event that just sort of sne@@ aks up on you .
and the fourth chapter is one where a variety of things can happen .
eighty percent of the people on death row are people who had exposure to the juvenile justice system .
you don &apos;t have the pu@@ st@@ ules or the redness and inflammation .
maybe that &apos;s because you don &apos;t actually have acne .
this kid told him , you know , you gotta watch the guys , and you gotta go out and find the guys who like to walk , because getting on base by a walk is just as good , and in our healthcare system we need to figure out , is that really a good pitch or should we let it go by and not swing at everything ?
NT : I needed no models , drawings or experiments .
but that &apos;s not all what we need to do . we need to use active systems .

to understand and use it san@@ ely , as a part of the civilization yet to evolve requires a vastly larger population of scientifically trained people like you .
during 41 years of teaching biology at Harvard , I watched sadly as bright students turned away from the possibility of a scientific career or even from taking non-@@ required courses in science because they were afraid of failure .
these ma@@ th-@@ pho@@ bes deprive science and medicine of im@@ measurable amounts of badly needed talent .
I found out that advances in science rarely come upstream from an ability to stand at a blackboard and conjure images from unfolding mathematical pro@@ positions and equations .
we challenged ourselves to create an online class that would be equal or better in quality to our Stanford class , but to bring it to anyone in the world for free .
that &apos;s just what we were going for .
and it &apos;s a little bit ironic that we set about to disrupt traditional education , and in doing so , we ended up making our online class much more like a traditional college class than other online classes .
Stanford Cour@@ ser@@ a , U@@ d@@ acity , M@@ I@@ T@@ x and others have more classes coming .
it only looks like nothing &apos;s moving because , well , Saturn here is 700,000 miles away , and Titan here is 4,000 to 5,000 miles away .
they laughed . they dismissed us .
so within the company , there &apos;s no difference in the forward c@@ itation rates of their Indian subsi@@ di@@ aries versus their U.S. subsi@@ di@@ aries .
I mean I &apos;m nervous enough as it is .
pan tro@@ glo@@ dy@@ tes , the name we give him , means &quot; cave dwell@@ er . &quot;

now , conventional wisdom says , &quot; Well , hey , our intellectual property belongs to us , and if someone tries to inf@@ ringe it , we &apos;re going to get out our lawyers and we &apos;re going to sue them . &quot;
people didn &apos;t know about things .

I never struck anyone .
it &apos;s quite remarkable . think about it .
and , yeah , the amazing part is that this superconductor that you see here is only half a micron thick . it &apos;s extremely thin .
( Applause ) And again , that &apos;s not all . I can adjust its position like this , and rotate , and it freely moves in this new position .
now , while I &apos;ll let it circulate for a little more , let me tell you a little bit about super@@ conduc@@ tors .
my work with criminals and terrorists has actually been highly educational .
they also monitored the Internet and social media to monitor the progress of their attacks and how many people they had killed .
they came upon a suite on the top floor of the hotel , and they kicked down the door and they found a man hiding by his bed .
so how we use yeast in the future is going to be really interesting .
that &apos;s a lot of people .
that &apos;s what happened with my dad .
so the first thing as I show you in the video is that we may be able to control the trajectory of a sailing boat better , or we may be able to never be in ir@@ ons , so never facing the wind , we always can catch the wind from both sides .
so that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking for developing . ( Applause ) And we replace the human being -- to go , for example , for measuring radioactivity , you don &apos;t want a human to be sailing those robots -- with batteries , motors , micro-@@ controllers and sensors .
and I think you should do something unusual with them , because these are bonus minutes .
hundreds of millions of people use social games like F@@ arm@@ V@@ ille or Wor@@ ds With Friends to stay in daily contact with real-life friends and family .
you can see that in this alter ego portrait by Rob@@ bie Cooper of a gamer with his avatar .
and Stanford University has been doing research for five years now to document how playing a game with an idealized avatar changes how we think and act in real life , making us more courageous , more ambitious , more committed to our goals .
really wanting to die .
now at the time , I &apos;m thinking to myself , what is going on here ?
the game was helping us experience what scientists call post-traumatic growth , which is not something we usually hear about .
sloth , giraffe , elephant , snake . okay , let &apos;s see what we got .
what I thought about was , what caused the diabetes ?
so people are really into cleanliness , right ?
now what these transplants , these fecal transplants , or the poo tea suggest to me , and many other people have come up with this same idea , is that the microbial community in and on us , it &apos;s an organ .
J@@ ared F@@ ick@@ lin : Thank you . ( Applause ) There are 1,400 stars .
so watch closely and see what your eyes can hear .
does this sound familiar to you ?
now , we can take a map of a race track , we can take a mathematical model of a car , and with some iteration , we can actually find the fastest way around that track .
watch the mental workload , and watch the steering .
not a challenging task .
do we want our car to perhaps be a partner , a coach , someone that can use their understanding of the situation to help us reach our potential ?
&quot; they &apos;re not sure this rises to the level of harassment , and they &apos;re not set up technically to find the device . &quot;
we then talked about her coming to my lab and us performing a radio sweep of her car , but I wasn &apos;t even sure that would work , given that some of these devices are con@@ figured to only transmit when they &apos;re inside safe zones or when the car is moving .
but if you send in a fake GPS signal , another peak pops up , and if you can get these two peaks perfectly aligned , the tracking points can &apos;t tell the difference , and they get hijacked by the stronger counterfeit signal , with the authentic peak getting forced off .
people figured that it would be too complex or too expensive for some hacker to build one .
if you want to choose to punch that punch card clock , you actually age me .
all you need is a single onco@@ gene .
so , what do we do now ?
( Applause )
let &apos;s take food imports .
there is the people , and then there is the government or leaders .
it &apos;s the seat of government .
and then it will have what economists call external effects on a local economy .
that &apos;s 5,000 fewer kids dying every day , ten times you lot not dead every day , because of all of these partnerships .
and then we &apos;ve got to connect with the big crowd .
and look at the state of global politics today .
if there was an incident today where a hundred kids died in some tragedy or where , say , a hundred kids were kidnapped and then rescued by special forces , I mean , it would be all over the news for a week , right ?
this song we &apos;re doing now is called &quot; Z@@ abalaza , &quot; and it means &quot; rebel . &quot;

this is my passport from 2004 .
you &apos;re not allowed to appear on U.K. passports with electronic equipment , but I insisted to the passport office that what they were seeing was actually a new part of my body , an extension of my brain , and they finally accepted me to appear with the passport photo .
at Ver@@ du@@ n , in 19@@ 16 , over a 300-@@ day period , 700,000 people were killed , so about 2,000 a day .
we worry about the movement of illegal weapons and trafficking . above all , perhaps , we worry about human trafficking , and the awful cost of it .
Eigh@@ ty-five percent cannot read when they enter the security forces of Afghanistan .

now , looking back , the most harrowing part of that experience was not just the hospital visits -- these were very painful for my wife , understandably so .
and these were being thrust upon us by the doctors .
these are well-meaning doctors , some of them have gone on to become very good friends .
right ? it can happen in the stock market .
and therefore , there are times when you &apos;re facing the IN@@ CA , when the feedback is going to be immediate , negative , concrete and you have the sense of agency , where you &apos;re far better off taking the passenger &apos;s seat and have someone else drive .
and through camp@@ us-@@ level proce@@ edings , Title IX goes so far as to give victims equitable rights during the campus process , which means that victims can represent their own interests during proce@@ edings , rather than relying on educational institutions to do so .
it &apos;s time for accountability to become the norm after gender violence .
there &apos;s nothing done to this image .
( music ) ( Din@@ os@@ aur roaring ) ( Applause ) So then , after the fun , comes the more emotional side of what we do , because effectively , this technology allows you to see the world through someone &apos;s eyes , and for that person to be able to take a moment in time and effectively store it and tag it to something physical that exists in the real world .
on the emotional side , we have people who &apos;ve done things like send postcards and Christmas cards back to their family with little messages on them .
MM on video : one , two , three . go !
that &apos;s the real question , because this is something that &apos;s been there , part of every society that &apos;s deprived of enough resources .
often the roofs are broken , so you don &apos;t have enough darkness in the classroom to do these things .
it &apos;s a decimal machine . everything &apos;s done in decimal .

nature has been called the greatest architect of forms .

through this very simple process , we can create an astounding variety of forms .
so I &apos;m not going to spend too much time -- just to show you , refresh your memories that we are here for &quot; Africa : the Next Chap@@ ter &quot; because for the first time there really is a platform to build on .
after decades of 2 percent , we are now at 5 percent , and it &apos;s going to -- projected -- 6 and 7 percent even .
I want to remind you again -- I know you saw these statistics before -- from almost 6 billion we are now at about 18 billion .
the issue here is how do we get a partnership that involves government donors , the private sector and ordinary African people taking charge of their own lives ?
for me , the issue about aid -- I don &apos;t think that Africans need to now go all the way over to the other side and feel bad about aid .

but that is the Ministry &apos;s data . he shows 50 .
so this kind of freedom is a targeted and precise window .
and what I discovered is , what I should do is not actually replicate what they saw , is replicate what they remembered .
yeah , you all have a body , right ?
I thought what I &apos;d do is , I &apos;d use three versions of physical thinking to make something .
they &apos;re no longer people , just pure lines , and I &apos;m going to work with them almost as objects to think with , yeah ?
if you reach with your elbow , where would it be ?
well , not exactly .
saving the lives of billions , eradicating disease , feeding the hungry , teaching kids to read ?
myths are fictions , but this one is true , true to the best of our knowledge , which is the only truth we can have .
there &apos;s still more work to do , because we &apos;re building this culture shift .
I walked away from it completely and decided to do care work .
I was documenting a bunch of street kids .
( Laughter ) &quot; E@@ w , that smells funny . what &apos;s a fu@@ fu ? &quot; they asked .
she had a love of fashion and worked in a sewing factory in lower Manhattan , until she saved up enough to open her own women &apos;s clothing store .

what you see here is two males on the left who are standing together .
first of all , you need to be impressive and intimidating and demonstrate your vig@@ or on occasion and show that you are very strong , and there &apos;s all sorts of ways of doing that .
Chris Anderson : William , hi . good to see you .
but again , I am not a farmer . I &apos;m a teacher .

so , Bob Dylan , like all folk singers , he copied melodies , he transformed them , he combined them with new lyrics which were frequently their own concoction of previous stuff .
let &apos;s hear what Jeff Han has to say about this new@@ f@@ angled technology .

today &apos;s slavery is about commerce , so the goods that enslaved people produce have value , but the people producing them are disposable .
they usher@@ ed me down a narrow set of stairs that led to this dirty , di@@ mly fluorescent lit basement .
many of them drown .
after another two hours of hiking , the winding trail abruptly ended at a clearing , and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a football field , and all of them were full of enslaved people labor@@ ing .
I truly believe , if we can see one another as fellow human beings , then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery .
these images are not of issues . they are of people , real people , like you and me , all deserving of the same rights , dignity and respect in their lives .
I hope that these images awa@@ ken a force in those who view them , people like you , and I hope that force will ignite a fire , and that fire will shine a light on slavery , for without that light , the beast of bon@@ d@@ age can continue to live in the shadows .
and my mother came up and said , &quot; What on Earth are you doing ? &quot;

I get a call from Cait@@ ria , hear the news , and start tracking the radar online to call the family back when another super@@ cell was forming in their area .
as we watched , they became frustrated and left to go find somebody to help on their own .
you can guess what happened next , right ? ( Laughter ) The outrage was so swi@@ ft , so volu@@ min@@ ous , so unanimous , that the Council of Ar@@ gy@@ ll and Bu@@ te reversed themselves the same day and said , &quot; We would , we would never censor a nine-year-old . &quot; ( Laughter ) Ex@@ cept , of course , this morning . ( Laughter ) And this brings up the question , what made them think they could get away with something like that ? ( Laughter ) And the answer is , all of human history prior to now .
so most open-source projects just held their noses and adopted the feu@@ dal management systems .
and then , 15 years after looking at Linux and figuring out how the community worked , he said , &quot; I think I know how to write a version control system for free people . &quot;

what if your employees experience a culture of bias , exclusion and worse ?
what if there &apos;s a data breach , and it feels an awful lot like a co@@ ver@@ -up than seriously addressing it ?
( Laughter ) Yeah . OK . alright . awesome .
empathy , logic , authenticity were all wob@@ bling like crazy .
but it &apos;s very important that words are at the center of politics , and all politicians know they have to try and control language .
but the third thing you can learn -- and this is the really important one , the point I want to leave you on -- is that the title , &quot; President of the United States of America , &quot; doesn &apos;t sound that humble at all these days , does it ?
we have to think like exist@@ enti@@ alists : it &apos;s not the painting we would have painted , it &apos;s the painting that we actually painted .
turns out they all know what a medical device is supposed to look like .
I &apos;ve since learned that if you really want to make a difference in the world , you have to design outcomes .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s been a lot of talk about narrative in Africa .
and this is the difficulty that I face .
have I not myself been beaten ? &quot;
can we all just close our eyes for a minute ?
can we map that space , using the language of neutrinos or cosmic rays , taking the boun@@ ding condition of the body as its limit , but in complete reversal of , in a way , the most traditional Greek idea of pointing ?
but one thing I &apos;m actually really nervous about is my hands shaking .
it &apos;s this expression of joy and humility that often gets lost in engineering , and for me it was a way to learn about hardware without having my performance anxiety get in the way .
artists can take us to a far-flung part of the city that we haven &apos;t explored , or they can take us into that building that we pass every day but we never went into .
back to Back is an Australian company of people with intellectual disabilities . I saw their amazing show in New York at the St@@ aten Island Fer@@ ry Ter@@ minal at rush hour .
so , the dialogue with the local and the global , the audience as participant and player and protagonist , the innovative use of site , all of these things come to play in the amazing work of the fantastic French company Royal de Lux@@ e .
and that simple motion of forwards and upwards , it &apos;s the most basic direction of progress we humans recognize .
just how that happened is best told through the 1960 classic by W.@@ W. Ros@@ tow .
we want to get everybody out of the hole , over the social foundation and into that green doughnut itself .

things grow , and they grow up and they mature , and it &apos;s only by doing so that they can thrive for a very long time .
we , the beneficiaries of globalization , seem to exploit these victims with every purchase we make , and the injustice feels embedded in the products themselves .

non-@@ technical , non-@@ biologist amateurs play a video game in which they visually rearrange the structure of the protein , allowing the computer to manage the atomic forces and interactions and identify structural issues .
when first reported by the media , full credit for such a feat was given to an algorithm from the New York City design firm Lo@@ cal Pro@@ jects . the truth is a bit more nuanced .

Thank you . ( Applause )
it &apos;s modular . let &apos;s say something happens that &apos;s totally unexpected to one of the modules .
well , I set up laboratories in Santa Cruz at the California Fish and Game facility , and that facility allowed us to have big seawater tanks to test some of these ideas .
we &apos;d be growing oysters and things that would be producing high value products and food , and this would be a market driver as we build the system to larger and larger scales so that it becomes , ultimately , competitive with the idea of doing it for fuels .
so the O@@ ME@@ G@@ A system will be part of this type of an outcome , and that when we &apos;re finished using it in the marine environment , we &apos;ll be using it , hopefully , on fields .
and so , in 2005 , we started the New York Ste@@ m C@@ ell Foundation Laboratory so that we would have a small organization that could do this work and support it .
I &apos;m glad that debate is happening on this .
that became , as it were , a way of confronting large businesses in the business of wasting food , and exposing , most importantly , to the public , that when we &apos;re talking about food being thrown away , we &apos;re not talking about rotten stuff , we &apos;re not talking about stuff that &apos;s beyond the pale .
so I want you to imagine that these nine biscuits that I found in the bin represent the global food supply , okay ? we start out with nine .
we fed 5,000 people all on food that otherwise would have been wasted .
it connects us to our loved ones , our family , friends and colleagues , at home and overseas .
it &apos;s a great time to be a molecular biologist . ( Laughter ) Re@@ ading and writing DNA code is getting easier and cheaper .
that &apos;s a lot more than conventional science has done .
a bio@@ hacker in Germany , a journalist , wanted to know whose dog was leaving little presents on his street ?
it actually is a Japanese beetle .
you can make a bio@@ censor out of yeast to detect pollutants in water .
so social scientists have spent a lot of time looking at the effects of our body language , or other people &apos;s body language , on judgments .
so we know that our nonverbals govern how other people think and feel about us . there &apos;s a lot of evidence .
so powerful people tend to be , not surprisingly , more assertive and more confident , more optimistic .
so it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves .
people hate this .
and the epit@@ ome was when I literally marched into the streets of Ny@@ ami@@ ra@@ mbo , which is the popular quarter of Kigali , with a bucket , and I sold all these little dough@@ nuts to people , and I came back , and I was like , &quot; You see ? &quot;
they buy it , they dry it and they bring it to this factory , which was purchased in part by , again , patient capital from No@@ v@@ arti@@ s , who has a real interest in getting the powder so that they can make Co@@ ar@@ tem .
it costs , at manufacturing point , six dollars to produce these , and it costs the establishment another six dollars to distribute it , so the market price in a free market would be about 12 dollars per net .
but what it takes is a commitment from all of us to essentially refuse tr@@ ite assumptions , get out of our ideological boxes .

the Minecraft community went bananas over this project , and Ben became an instant media celebrity .
they are doing it because of one motivation only .
and he kind of nodded , you know ?
or you change the typeface to something like this .
and I often say , well , there &apos;s something good to how things used to be done . there &apos;s something very different about it , something we should figure out what is good about how we did it , even in this new era .
you know , how do you , as the leader , scan , connect , make things happen ? so for instance , you might open up a distribution here and find the different sub@@ divisions in there , and know that you know someone in E@@ co , over here , and these people here are in E@@ co , the people you might engage with as CEO , people going across the hierarchy .
so you might want to , for instance , get a head@@ s-@@ up display on how you &apos;re interacting with them .

they put people into fMRI machines , and they showed them pictures of angular objects and round ones .
you &apos;ve probably all read about it or heard about in some incarnation . let me give you a two-@@ sentence version of it .
a lot of people look at this and they say , &quot; OK , but those are very specific , narrow tasks , and most knowledge workers are actually gener@@ alists .

so that &apos;s not all of the trials that were ever conducted on these drugs , because we can never know if we have those , but it is the ones that were conducted in order to get the marketing author@@ ization .
about half of all trials , on average , go missing in action , and we know that positive findings are around twice as likely to be published as negative findings .
this is a disaster .
but what was striking to me over the last several years was that less and less was I going out into the world , and more and more , I was sitting in front of my computer screen .
they stretch across the ocean . they &apos;re three or five or eight thousand miles in length , and if the material science and the computational technology is incredibly complicated , the basic physical process is shockingly simple . light goes in on one end of the ocean and comes out on the other , and it usually comes from a building called a landing station that &apos;s often tucked away in@@ conspic@@ u@@ ously in a little sea@@ side neighborhood , and there are ampli@@ fiers that sit on the ocean floor that look kind of like bluefin tuna , and every 50 miles they amplify the signal , and since the rate of transmission is incredibly fast , the basic unit is a 10-@@ gig@@ ab@@ it-@@ per-@@ second wavelength of light , maybe a thousand times your own connection , or capable of carrying 10,000 video streams , but not only that , but you &apos;ll put not just one wavelength of light through one of the fibers , but you &apos;ll put maybe 50 or 60 or 70 different wavelengths or colors of light through a single fiber , and then you &apos;ll have maybe eight fibers in a cable , four going in each direction .
( music ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) Thank you . it &apos;s a distinct privilege to be here .
everything , I would say -- everything that matters -- Ex@@ cept every thing , and except matter .
( Laughter ) The laws of physics : invisible , eternal , omni@@ present , all powerful .
time . nobody can see time .
which is great news for psycho@@ analysts , because otherwise they &apos;d be out of a job .
you know it &apos;s an or@@ gy .
you will recall that in 1976 , June 16 , the students of South Africa boycot@@ ted the language of Afri@@ ka@@ ans as the medium of the op@@ pressor , as they were sort of like really told that they must do everything in Afri@@ ka@@ ans -- biology , mathematics -- and what about our languages ?
so it was on the 10th of June , and they came , and they surrounded the house , and my grandmother switched off all the lights in the house , and opened the kitchen door .
I look like one person but I &apos;m two people . I &apos;m Ed@@ die who is here , and at the same time , my alter ego is a big green bo@@ xy avatar nicknamed Cy@@ ber Frank .
what &apos;s happened is , we &apos;ve changed the scale .
yes , learn , but I know you guys grew up in the days when there were actually these things called correct answers , because of the answer you gave me to the horizontal line puzzle , and you believe it will last forever .
all you do , go into the timeline , double-@@ click the item , and I &apos;ve set it to Toronto , because that &apos;s where I &apos;m from .
so my father might not understand what it is that I do for a living .
so , being naive , and being half-@@ German , I decided , &quot; Ar@@ is , why don &apos;t you build your own map ? &quot;
I &apos;d like to share three sets of examples , starting with adapting to violent storms and floods .
I think these are inspiring examples of what &apos;s possible when we feel empowered to plan for a world that will be different .
can you imagine , every human being is carrying that equipment , even Paris Hil@@ ton ? ( Laughter ) Go figure .
this isn &apos;t for the one in four . this is for the four in four .
and while we &apos;re at it , can we please stop the stigma ?
if we have a lot of shared genotypes , and a lot of shared outcomes , and a lot of shared lifestyle choices , and a lot of shared environmental information , we can start to tease out the correlations between subtle variations in people , the choices they make and the health that they create as a result of those choices , and there &apos;s open-source infrastructure to do all of this .
if I &apos;m trying to show we &apos;re a better product , I probably wouldn &apos;t do things like Gu@@ antan@@ am@@ o Bay .
so we &apos;ve got to find a different mechanism , and one of the best mechanisms I &apos;ve ever come across is the victims of terrorism .
they &apos;ll see it as freedom fighters and truth against injustice , imperialism , etc .
it self-@@ educa@@ tes both sides , enables a better understanding , reveals the strengths and weaknesses , and yes , like some of the speakers before , the shared vulnerability does lead to trust , and it does then become , that process , part of normal@@ ization .
now , I just want to end with saying , if we follow reason , we realize that I think we &apos;d all say that we want to have a perception of terrorism which is not just a pure military perception of it .
now if perception is grounded in our history , it means we &apos;re only ever responding according to what we &apos;ve done before .
BL : this is the epit@@ ome of technology . right . okay .
well , we also learned that Vas@@ ari , who was commissioned to re@@ model the Hall of the 500 between 15@@ 60 and 15@@ 74 by the Grand Duke Cos@@ im@@ o I of the Medic@@ i family , we have at least two instances when he saved masterpieces specifically by placing a brick wall in front of it and leaving a small air gap .
one that we &#91; see &#93; here , Mas@@ acci@@ o , the church of Santa Maria No@@ v@@ ella in Florence , so we just said , well maybe , V@@ is@@ ari has done something like that in the case of this great work of art by Leonardo , since he was a great admi@@ rer of Leonardo da Vinci .
there were 56 , and when our president wanted to am@@ end the constitution and remove term limits , he had to create 25 new districts , and now there are 81 .
you need W@@ emb@@ ley Sta@@ dium to host our parliament .
companies can even give control to hackers .
U.@@ K@@ .@@ -based Inter@@ flora monitored Twitter for users who were having a bad day , and then sent them a free bou@@ quet of flowers .
so it &apos;s very clear that if you look at these numbers or all the other numbers that I talk about in my book , &quot; World 3.@@ 0 , &quot; that we &apos;re very , very far from the no-@@ border effect benchmark , which would imply inter@@ nation@@ alization levels of the order of 85 , 90 , 95 percent .
maybe realizing that the number is just eight percent might help cool some of the super@@ heated rhetoric that we see around the immigration issue .
so I can tell you firsthand what it was like to have access to this leak . it was amazing . I mean , it was amazing .
that did end up with vulnerable people in Afghanistan being exposed . it also meant that the Bel@@ ar@@ us@@ sian dictator was given a handy list of all the pro-@@ democracy campaign@@ ers in that country who had spoken to the U.S. government .
well , to go back to our original story , the parents have panicked . they &apos;ve locked all the doors .
and the father says , &quot; I &apos;m very sorry . yes , it &apos;s true , I lied .
distinguished academics at the same time argued that democracies had this incredible range of side benefits .
a more modern example comes from people who try to convince us that homosexuality is immoral .
things have changed now . we have cars that we take across country .
the influence -- and if you have noticed , one of my spheres of influence is biology -- is from a gras@@ shopper .
so this simple mash@@ up reveals that donors have not financed any schools in the areas with the most out-of-@@ school children , provoking new questions . is development assistance targeting those who most need our help ?
and the government is responsive . so for instance , when it was reported on this website that 800 students were at risk because school re@@ pairs had stalled due to corruption , the Department of Education in the Philippines took swi@@ ft action .
and we found activity in a lot of brain regions .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There &apos;s magic to love !
behind each of the million children in institutions , there is usually a story of parents who are desperate and feel they &apos;ve run out of options , like Nat@@ alia in Mol@@ do@@ va , who only had enough money to feed her baby , and so had to send her older son to the institution ; or Des@@ i , in Bulgaria , who looked after her four children at home until her husband died , but then she had to go out to work full time , and with no support , felt she had no option but to place a child with disabilities in an institution ; or the countless young girls too terrified to tell their parents they &apos;re pregnant , who leave their babies in a hospital ; or the new parents , the young couple who have just found out that their first@@ born child has a disability , and instead of being provided with positive messages about their child &apos;s potential , are told by the doctors , &quot; Forget her , leave her in the institution , go home and make a healthy one . &quot;
there &apos;s spring , summer , autumn and â   Voice : my favorite season is winter@@ .@@ MT : well yeah , mine too .
so NASA wanted me to take some pictures of Moon sand , so they sent me sand from all the different lan@@ dings of the Apollo missions that happened 40 years ago .
now as I said before , bats are essential for our ecosystems to function correctly . and why is this ?
in Europe alone , by 2050 , there is going to be a 70 percent increase of individuals over 65 , and 170 percent increase in individuals over 80 .
and I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to come together at the end , we &apos;re going to have a must@@ ac@@ he@@ -@@ the@@ med party , we &apos;re going to have D@@ Js , we &apos;re going to celebrate life , and we &apos;re going to change the face of men &apos;s health . &quot;
so now I live in Los Angeles , because the Pros@@ tate Cancer Foundation of the U.S. is based there , and I always get asked by the media down there , because it &apos;s so celebr@@ ity-@@ driven , &quot; Who are your celebrity ambassadors ? &quot;
and that city can go on and inspire a state , and that state can go on and inspire a nation , and beyond that , you can create a global movement that is changing the face of men &apos;s health .
we &apos;ve been fortunate with this project to collect quite a lot of data , a lot more data of this kind than I think has ever been collected before , over 6@@ 50,000 real-time reports from over 15,000 people .
and yet it &apos;s not clear what the relationship is between our use of this ability and our happiness .
he doesn &apos;t have that same self-worth .
the dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite , out of a lump of rock . it &apos;s made up of lots of little bits .
and any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes , is touched , any time you touch a word , you use it in a new context , you give it a new con@@ notation , you verb it , you make the mobile move .
and I &apos;m not even talking about poly@@ se@@ my , which is the greedy habit some words have of taking more than one meaning for themselves .
we don &apos;t even see that there &apos;s a gap on the map .
but he found 140 comets without a telescope .
one of the things we learned was that poor communities don &apos;t buy products in bulk .
I can assure you there &apos;s deception there .
that diagonal line is the truth line . if their dot &apos;s on it , they were telling exactly the truth .
I thought , &quot; Oh , if there &apos;s no pictures , then there &apos;ll be no record . we need a record . &quot;
but the fact is , I &apos;m there , it looks like that , you have to take a picture .
then I used , tried to use the medical college girls .
( Applause )
it &apos;s a bit funny , because I did write that humans will become digital , but I didn &apos;t think it will happen so fast and that it will happen to me .
fascism denies all identities except the national identity and insists that I have obligations only towards my nation .
if today , Russians look in the fascist mirror , they will see Russia as the most beautiful thing in the world .
and in the modern age , machines became more important than land .
given 20th-century technology , it was simply inefficient to try and concentrate too much data and too much power in one place .
so , if I understand you right , you &apos;re aler@@ ting us to two big dangers here .
CA : so , putting it all together , Yuval , you &apos;ve got this unique vision .
and the devices usually available to these people are not made for that context , break down quickly , and are hard to repair .
that &apos;s where you can take a guy like me , an academic , but analyze and test and create a new technology and quanti@@ tatively determine how much better the performance is .
the smartest people in your community you don &apos;t even know , because they don &apos;t come to your public meetings .
Peter Dr@@ ucker , one of the greatest management consultants in history , died age 96 , a few years ago .
the idea of finding a different technology had absolutely taken over , and there were tiny , tiny little factories in back@@ waters .
I &apos;m a brain scientist , and as a brain scientist , I &apos;m actually interested in how the brain learns , and I &apos;m especially interested in a possibility of making our brains smarter , better and faster .
now I want to step back a bit .
that &apos;s a statement about vision .
the first way is that they &apos;re actually able to resolve small detail in the context of clu@@ tter , and though that means being able to read the fine print on a prescription rather than using magni@@ fier glasses , you can actually do it with just your eyesight .
actually , those action video game players have many other advantages in terms of attention , and one aspect of attention which is also improved for the better is our ability to track objects around in the world .
Tommy M@@ iz@@ zone : tonight we &apos;re going to play you two songs .
we &apos;re three brothers from New Jersey , and the funny thing is that , believe it or not , we are hooked on blue@@ grass and we &apos;re excited to play it for you tonight .
so 5,000 years after the invention of the wheel , we have a new wheel .
you really reduce congestion quite substantially .
so after a while they would all come back because they have sort of gotten used to charges .
and the other question , who changed their mind ?
I remember one night , one of the nurses came in , Jonathan , with a whole lot of plastic straws .
I was in my wheelchair .
they had to slide me up on the wing to put me in the cockpit .
it is a struggle to try and live a life that is set by the moral codes written in the Koran .
but the good news is that the global jihad is almost over , as bin Laden defined it .
but they have been distracted recently .
time , patience , subtle@@ ty , understanding -- these are harder to give .
contrary to what most people think , people don &apos;t pay , taxpayers don &apos;t pay , for your life when you &apos;re in prison . you &apos;ve got to pay for your own life .
so I hope that you &apos;ll think about helping in some way .
the hunger and thirst was , and still remains : how do I get people who hate poetry to love me ?
you don &apos;t read other people &apos;s poetry , and you don &apos;t got any subordin@@ ation for verbal measures to ton@@ al consideration . &quot; ( Laughter ) Now he kept on ra@@ mbling about poetry and styles and Nu@@ y@@ ori@@ can Friday nights .
dude , you go to Ri@@ ker &apos;s Island Academy .
they were developed in Japan pretty recently .
what that means is we have the tools to break the back of this epidemic .
and this is how it works : patent holders , inventors that develop new medicines patent those inventions , but make those patents available to the Medic@@ ines Patent Pool . the Medic@@ ines Patent Pool then license those out to whoever needs access to those patents .
the Medic@@ ines Patent Pool is a voluntary mechanism .
and what &apos;s of interest here is that little brain is quite cool .
so the ball leaves a little thermal shadow , and the beetle climbs on top of the ball and wi@@ pes its face , and all the time it &apos;s trying to cool itself down , we think , and avoid the hot sand that it &apos;s walking across .
but it &apos;s walking forwards , and it &apos;s actually taking a pel@@ let of dry dung with it .
my Indian cab driver showed up at the W , and I asked him to take me to the Sher@@ aton , and he said , &quot; No problem , sir . &quot;
( Laughter ) &quot; I don &apos;t know where we &apos;re going . &quot;
( Laughter ) But never like , &quot; H@@ a ha ha ha la . &quot;
( Laughter ) We like to laugh . we like to celebrate life .
if you &apos;re walking down the aisle speaking Arabic , you might freak them out -- ( I@@ mit@@ ating Arabic ) They might say , &quot; What &apos;s he talking about ? &quot;
we had to deal with composite images that were merging photos from previous storms .
and finding the source becomes more and more important -- finding the good source -- and Twitter is where most journalists now go .
no reply . like , a huge proportion of them couldn &apos;t be bothered after they had just started , they just signed up , to reply .
I have to say , this sounds awesome . ( Laughter ) I could totally have used this 10 minutes ago .
for half the people , the article included a brain image , and for the other half , it was the same article but it didn &apos;t have a brain image .
so what I &apos;m going to do is show you how to spot a couple of classic moves , dead gi@@ ve@@ a@@ ways , really , for what &apos;s vari@@ ously been called neuro-@@ bunk , neuro-@@ bol@@ locks , or , my personal favorite , neuro-@@ fl@@ ap@@ doodle .
but that &apos;s not stopping us from trying to figure it out anyway .
Thank you . ( Applause )
so I start answering this girl , and she &apos;s telling me she saw the poster and she asked her family to come , because they don &apos;t have a computer , she asked her family to come to see the poster , and they &apos;re all sitting in the living room crying .
so here are a few of them .
and they just came , and it was so much , I remember one day , Micha@@ l , she was talking with the journalist , and she was asking him , &quot; Who &apos;s gonna see the show ? &quot; and he said , &quot; Everybody . &quot;
these men were 10,000 miles from home , more than 1,000 miles from the nearest scrap of land .
our fears provoke in us a very similar form of suspense .
when the last of the survivors were finally picked up by two passing ships , less than half of the men were left alive , and some of them had re@@ sorted to their own form of cannibalism .
as we &apos;ve seen , the men of the Essex had no trouble with the artistic part .
well , there &apos;s two principle ways .
so we &apos;ve done field trials now in the C@@ ay@@ man Islands , a small one in Malaysia , and two more now in Brazil .
we &apos;ve separated the males from the females .
as you see , temples and gods play a big role in all ancient civilizations .
so if you think about this as the problem of a dysfunctional , hyper-@@ polarized institution , well , the first step is , do what you can so that fewer hyper-@@ partis@@ ans get elected in the first place , and when you have closed party primar@@ ies , and only the most committed Republicans and Democrats are voting , you &apos;re nomin@@ ating and selecting the most extreme hyper-@@ partis@@ ans .
this is where we are as a country .
&#91; &quot; finding Freedom : &apos; by creating our own stories we learn to take the texts of our lives as seriously as we do &apos; official &apos; narratives . &apos; - Davis 2009 , TEDx Women &quot; &#93; I started making work that aimed to communicate something of the joy and freedom I felt when using a wheelchair -- a power chair -- to negotiate the world .
when I was a kid , I loved to draw , and the most talented artist I knew was my mother , but my mother was addicted to heroin .
so throughout my childhood , my mother was incarcerated and I didn &apos;t have my father because I didn &apos;t even learn his first name until I was in the sixth grade .
and I would like to say that life was totally easy with them .
my grandparents , they were in the middle of it .
I &apos;d like to share with you the story of one of my patients called Celine .
however , the inequalities that exist between richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding pose a real risk for exploitation , especially in the context of extern@@ ally-@@ funded research .
Thank you .
what you learn when you go to Australia is the Australians are very competitive .
and it is , to prevent ri@@ ckets and so on .
but I also became interested in research , and in particular I became interested in this substance , nitric oxide .
so we put patients with these subjects under the UV , and their NO levels do go up , and their blood pressure goes down .
it &apos;s yes , sir ; no , sir ; no excuse , sir . &quot;
they come to respect him .
and at that moment they shut out all the other languages that they could be learning at that age , but by three months , that &apos;s her .
I don &apos;t know how many of you are New Yorkers , but there were these ten@@ ement buildings , and these women were always hanging out one of the windows , leaning on a pillow .
and so , it &apos;s so essential that we kind of put this culture back into our families , all families .
we touch every nation . every nation touches us .
but what I always have to do is stop at one of the corners and get a hot dog from the immigrant push@@ cart pe@@ dd@@ ler .
but I want to show you a different approach , and this is this robot over here , which has four legs .
so that was what happened when we had a couple of -- that &apos;s what happened when you had a couple of -- OK , OK , OK -- ( Laughter ) -- they don &apos;t like each other . so there &apos;s a different robot .
and do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie ?
now , I don &apos;t think that &apos;s the fault of popular entertainment .
what do these two have in common ?
and the thing that struck me the most , that broke my heart , was walking down the main street of Sarajevo , where my friend A@@ id@@ a saw the tank coming 20 years ago , and in that road were more than 12,000 red chairs , empty , and every single one of them symbolized a person who had died during the siege , just in Sarajevo , not in all of Bosnia , and it stretched from one end of the city to a large part of it , and the saddest for me were the tiny little chairs for the children .
Thank you very much .
so here &apos;s Allan teaching an English-speaking surgeon in Africa these basic fundamental skills necessary to do minimally invasive surgery .
we need a universal translator .
if you remember what I told you about F@@ LS at the beginning , it &apos;s knowledge and skills .
anyways , contemporary art in the 20th century is about doing something weird and filling the void with explanation and interpretation -- essentially the same as I did .
usually they sound awful . awful indeed .
the kid has already lost interest and is doing something else , but the dad alone builds ca@@ stles .
I have students like you in the class -- many who don &apos;t major in writing .
as soon as we moved to New England -- you know , that place where Connor was supposed to feel so safe -- he bought three guns .
so the only thing I can think of is say , &quot; Listen . let me tell you a story .
don &apos;t get too attached to him .
I &apos;m reminded of what the architect M@@ ies van der Ro@@ he said , and I paraphrase , when he said that sometimes , you have to lie in order to tell the truth .
and they &apos;ll then decide when to do their street interviews .
she may have possessions that she would like to trade at times she doesn &apos;t need them .
but throughout the economy , there are facilities that could likewise leverage a new generation of markets for the benefit of all of us .
these mechanisms , these facilities are not in the gift of Cra@@ ig@@ sli@@ st or G@@ um@@ tree or Yahoo , they &apos;re controlled by the state .
think of it as a regulated public utility .
it &apos;s about enshr@@ ining government &apos;s role as a publi@@ cist for these markets .
so government then exits the frame .
so this would just be one more choice among millions of Internet forums .
so I &apos;m going to let all of you control this game using your voices .
because as they learn to code , it enables them to learn many other things , opens up many new opportunities for learning .
in Scratch , you can create something called a variable .
can feel like somebody &apos;s opening a tiny little box and asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it .
( Laughter ) But I wasn &apos;t asked to define myself by my parents .
I challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being .
almost 85,000 people watched that video , and then they started emailing us from all over the country , asking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces .
because if a picture is worth a thousand words , then a picture of a face needs a whole new vocabulary .
familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy .
( Applause )
I am here today not at all to inspire you with our success story of the zi@@ pper list and the elections .
so we know very well -- I showed you earlier -- that we need this energy .
( Applause )
we can download new diagnostics .
the freedom that was won in 1990 brought about a state of anarchy in the city , while the barbar@@ ism of the &apos; 90s brought about a loss of hope for the city .
they were paying in order to skip the queue , the long queue .
we put the citizen first , and not the cler@@ ks .
we can all change the world .
it &apos;s a porous asphalt , like I said , so you have only a small amount of bin@@ der between the stones .
today I am 22 .
I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war .
all that costs money .
you go to the next country on the list , Lux@@ emb@@ our@@ g , and you can see the red dot is exactly where it is for Korea , so Lux@@ emb@@ our@@ g spends the same per student as Korea does .
in the year 2000 , Korea did already very well , but the Koreans were concerned that only a small share of their students achieved the really high levels of excellence .
and you know what &apos;s interesting ? you won &apos;t believe it , but there are countries in which the most attractive place to be is not the shopping center but the school .
high performers on PISA embrace diversity with differentiated pedago@@ gical practices .
high-performing systems also share clear and ambitious standards across the entire spectrum .
so you have the suburbs and the periphery , you have a center , like a financial district , then the core will be something like the tallest high-rise building in the center .
now remember , we started out with 600,000 nodes , so these 7@@ 37 top players make up a bit more than 0.1 percent .
and this is slowly starting .
how do they relate , and how do they conflict ?
wanting them is one thing .
but the central agent is really that piece called the imagination .
one , they have a lot of sexual privacy .
we shut one down that was going to be big .
North Pole goes to the South , South Pole goes to the North , and vice versa .
Oh , and here &apos;s one other thing .
solar flares are enormous magnetic out@@ bursts from the Sun that bomb@@ ard the Earth with high-speed subatomic particles .
so even if you flung a million of these things out of orbit , the chances that one would actually hit us is fairly remote .
of more concern , I think , is the asteroids that exist between Mars and Jupiter .
it should be noted , of course , that the United States and the U.K. are the next in line .
and what that means is that every time you discuss the future , or any kind of a future event , grammatically you &apos;re forced to c@@ leave that from the present and treat it as if it &apos;s something visc@@ erally different .
yes , by the time they retire , futu@@ reless language speakers , holding constant their income , are going to retire with 25 percent more in savings .
we want to see and measure storms -- brainstorms , that is .
so when we look at the brains of these animals , on the top panel you see the alignment of 125 cells showing what happens with the brain activity , the electrical storms , of this sample of neurons in the brain when the animal is using a joystick .
this is one of the experiments in which that robot was able to walk autonomously .
well , my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass .
and as she carried the knife , she walked toward me and she held the clitoris , and she cut it off .
so I went back and I had to go back to the tradition .
and in the village also , there is one chief , an elder , who if he says yes , everybody will follow him .
and as we speak right now , three million girls in Africa are at risk of going through this mutilation .
they said , &quot; We wanted to put our girls in a safe place . &quot;
that made sense . and they agreed .
she &apos;s an orphan . yes , we could have taken her for that .
there was massive protest . a lot of us in this room took part in the protest in different forms .
here is not like anywhere else .
you see ? but the Ministry of Finance , the Per@@ man@@ ent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance , wrote me and said to me , that information is exemp@@ t too .
we will continue to press on .
I &apos;m obsessed with insects , particularly insect flight .
they have sex . they hide from predators .
so this is the preparation that one of my former post-@@ docs , Gab@@ y Ma@@ im@@ on , who &apos;s now at Rockefeller , developed , and it &apos;s basically a flight simulator but under conditions where you actually can stick an electrode in the brain of the fly and record from a genetically identified neuron in the fly &apos;s brain .
it was a sequence taken from another post-@@ doc in the lab , Bet@@ tin@@ a Sch@@ nell .
so instead of saying , &quot; You guys go off into that bunker and come back with a cell phone or a social network , &quot; you say , &quot; You go off and come up with one element , then bring it back . let &apos;s talk about it . let &apos;s adapt . &quot;
now look , naturally there &apos;s a gap between their kind of conduct in these meetings and their behavior the rest of the week , but the truth is it didn &apos;t really bother us .
let &apos;s just take a few examples .
adaptability is fine , but we also need bedrock .
almost anybody who &apos;s looked at well-@@ run organizations has come to pretty much the same conclusion .
( Laughter ) They said , &quot; Why have you put it there ? &quot;
I published everywhere . I wrote down and measured everything , and I said , in nine months , a group of children left alone with a computer in any language will reach the same standard as an office secretary in the West .
I started experimenting with other subjects , among them , for example , pronunci@@ ation .
the scores jumped to 50 percent .
what &apos;s learning going to be like ? we know what it &apos;s like today , children pouring over with their mobile phones on the one hand and then reluctantly going to school to pick up their books with their other hand .
it &apos;s been tried all over the world , and teachers sort of stand back and say , &quot; It just happens by itself ? &quot;
it &apos;s a facility which is practically unmanned .
but there were three problems , three enig@@ mas that I could not solve , and I want to share with you those problems , but most importantly , I think I figured out a proposal for a solution .
you might take states like Iowa and Ohio -- two very important political states , by the way -- those two governors , and they would say , we &apos;re going to lead the nation in producing the wind turbines and the wind energy .
because Republican and Democratic governors love to cut ribbons .
what do we actually know about our ancestors ?
that &apos;s why we need care from our parents .
people would yell at me from their cars .
( laughing ) And I &apos;d be , like , &quot; This is my job . &quot;
and it comes out and it sells about 25,000 copies in the first few weeks , and the label considers this a failure .
we have never understood it .
all of that grass is now covering the soil as dung , urine and litter or mul@@ ch , as every one of the gardeners amongst you would understand , and that soil is ready to absorb and hold the rain , to store carbon , and to break down methane .
let &apos;s look at some results .
our river is flowing and healthy and clean .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , Chris .
Allan Sav@@ ory : well , we have done this for a long time , and the only time we have ever had to provide any feed is during mine re@@ clamation , where it &apos;s 100 percent bare .
Ed@@ ith W@@ id@@ der ( on video ) : Oh my God . Oh my God ! are you kidding me ? other scientists : Oh ho ho ! that &apos;s just hanging there .
this is South Los Angeles . ( Laughter ) Li@@ qu@@ or stores , fast food , vacant lots .
and then somebody complained .
and at the same time we were being told what we were , we were being asked , &quot; What do you want to be when you grow up ? &quot;
when I was a kid , I wanted to be a man .
( Laughter ) When I was a kid , I wanted to shave .
and they said , &quot; Cho@@ ose something realistic . &quot;
well , you put those five things together -- you can &apos;t use money to lure talent away from the for-profit sector ; you can &apos;t advertise on anywhere near the scale the for-profit sector does for new customers ; you can &apos;t take the kinds of risks in pursuit of those customers that the for-profit sector takes ; you don &apos;t have the same amount of time to find them as the for-profit sector ; and you don &apos;t have a stock market with which to fund any of this , even if you could do it in the first place -- and you &apos;ve just put the nonprofit sector at an extreme disadvantage to the for-profit sector , on every level .
well , like most fana@@ tical dogma in America , these ideas come from old Pur@@ itan beliefs .
because they were labeled &quot; overhead . &quot;
who cares if the bake sale only has five percent overhead if it &apos;s tiny ?
but can an organism like a fruit fly , which is -- it &apos;s a great model organism because it &apos;s got a small brain , it &apos;s capable of complex and sophisticated behaviors , it breeds quickly , and it &apos;s cheap .
what can we do ? it &apos;s not so easy .
so three important ones that I can think of are persistence , gra@@ d@@ ations in intensity , and valence .
and this is one of the great things about fruit flies .
you see , you want to work on protecting the animals out there .
for number-@@ crun@@ chers like us , that is the ero@@ genous zone , and it &apos;s fair to say that I am , by now , sexually aroused by the coll@@ ating of data .
but there &apos;s a vaccine for that too .
and we had actually tried to get into original content back in 2005 , when we were on DVD only and buying films at Sund@@ ance -- Maggie Gy@@ ll@@ en@@ ha@@ al , &quot; Sher@@ ry@@ baby , &quot; we published on DVD -- we were a mini studio .
( Laughter ) CA : but clearly , from the Barry D@@ ill@@ ers and others in the media business , it feels like from nowhere , this company has come and has really revolutionized the business .
it looks like Netflix employees , compared to your peers &apos; , are basically the highest paid for equivalent jobs .
and the least likely to want to leave .
we do the opposite , which is : everybody gets all the information .
everyone would rate &quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler &apos;s List &quot; five stars , and then they &apos;d rate Adam Sand@@ ler , &quot; The D@@ o-@@ Over &quot; three stars .
&#91; &quot; paper speakers &quot; &#93; What we &apos;re seeing here is just a piece of paper with some copper tape on it connected to an mp@@ 3 player and a magnet .
so for a few hours , it all passed through China .
they have an informed opinion , but it &apos;s changing so quickly that even the experts don &apos;t know exactly what &apos;s going on .
even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant .
so as a result , the energy usage is very low , and it has the most advanced battery pack , and that &apos;s what gives it the range that &apos;s competitive , so you can actually have on the order of a 2@@ 50-@@ mile range .
em : typical le@@ ases are 20 years , but the value proposition is , as you &apos;re sort of allu@@ ding to , quite straightforward .
em : it was a close call . things almost didn &apos;t work out .
so we must solve this problem in order to become a space-@@ far@@ ing civilization .
so I think that &apos;s an important thing to do , and then also to really pay attention to negative feedback , and soli@@ cit it , particularly from friends .
and that &apos;s the main theme of what I want to say to you this morning .
how does that play out in terms of application to a disease ?
the normal cell , if you looked at it under the microscope , would have a nucleus sitting in the middle of the cell , which is nice and round and smooth in its boundaries and it looks kind of like that .
you probably know , if you &apos;ve been paying attention to some of the science literature that you can now take a skin cell and encourage it to become a liver cell or a heart cell or a kidney cell or a brain cell for any of us .
and it has cells in between that allow you to see what happens when you add a compound .
everything is covered in invisible ecosystems made of tiny lifeforms : bacteria , viruses and fungi .
our bodies are home to trillions of microbes , and these creatures define who we are .
the microbes in your gut can influence your weight and your moods .
another fac@@ et of how microbes get around is by people , and designers often cluster rooms together to facilitate interactions among people , or the sharing of ideas , like in labs and in offices .
what you &apos;re looking at is a signature of bacterial communities in the outdoor air , and how they vary over time .
a lot of buildings are operated this way , probably where you work , and companies do this to save money on their energy bill .
and much to my surprise , they were noticed .
so as part of the demonstration , what I have is a pair of gloves , and we &apos;ve coated one of the gloves with the nanotechnology coating , and let &apos;s see if you can tell which one , and I &apos;ll give you a hint .
the un@@ informed player doesn &apos;t know , but they know that the informed player knows .
that means that the brains are syn@@ ced up more closely in terms of simultaneous activity , and the arrows flow clearly from left to right .
so 14@@ 4,000 are called L@@ ester , which means about .@@ 05 percent is named L@@ ester .
now , what can we say about this democracy in US@@ A-@@ land ?
but I don &apos;t buy it .
there &apos;s nothing we can do . &quot;
because if you do , then what the hell are you , what are the hell are we doing ?
when Ben Franklin was carried from the constitutional convention in September of 17@@ 87 , he was stopped in the street by a woman who said , &quot; Mr. Franklin , what have you w@@ rought ? &quot;
( Applause ) Dan won his prize in medicine for demonstrating that high-@@ priced fake medicine works better than low-@@ priced fake medicine .
so there goes my theory of necro@@ phi@@ lia .
so I hope to see you next year in Rotterdam , the Netherlands , for Dead D@@ uck Day .
so instead of looking at large amounts of energy needed for each person in this room to get around in a city , now you can look at much smaller amounts and more sustainable transportation .
the next part I want to show you is something about positive motivation .
Thank you very much .
and then you shake it randomly and it starts to error correct and built the structure on its own .
but most importantly , we can use this same software for the design of nanoscale self-assembly systems and human scale self-assembly systems .
one , because playing &quot; Jeopardy &quot; is a great time .
people playing computers on game shows was the kind of thing I always imagined would happen in the future , and now I could be on the stage with it .
I had taken some artificial intelligence classes .
there was a big Watson logo in the middle of the stage .
and a lot of law firms are getting rid of paralegals because there &apos;s software that can sum up case laws and legal bri@@ efs and decisions .
now when facts come in handy like that -- I love that story because it shows you the power of one fact , one remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time -- normally something that &apos;s easier to see on game shows than in real life .
and on the other hand , we have the potential to be living in some gloomy dyst@@ opia where the machines have taken over and we &apos;ve all decided it &apos;s not important what we know anymore , that knowledge isn &apos;t valuable because it &apos;s all out there in the cloud , and why would we ever bother learning anything new .
that &apos;s the problem that we &apos;re trying to solve at Rom@@ o@@ tive -- that I and the other 20 nerds at Rom@@ o@@ tive are obsessed with solving .
and you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser , which is what you see Romo doing on the left .
SP : we like to give these insur@@ gents a fair chance .
and they wait until pretty much everybody &apos;s gone .
so when I talk about a disconnect , it &apos;s not only for maybe those people who don &apos;t know a soldier , which there obviously are . you know , these days , it &apos;s not like World War II , where there was a war front and a home front , and everybody seemed involved .
and really do give them a hug .
and it has been for 50 years an experiment .
and so we began to work on that , for years in the &apos; 60s .
quite frankly , you &apos;re talking about Americans .
because so many students are bored in class .
Aristotle said , &quot; Ex@@ cell@@ ence is never an accident .
he said , &quot; Choice , not chance , determines your destiny . &quot;
you look busy . how are you ?
now , I &apos;ve had two examples I want to quickly share with you of this kind of care customization on my own journey .
so these three pillars of personal health , care anywhere , care networking , care customization , are happening in pieces now , but this vision will completely fail if we don &apos;t step up as caregivers and as patients to take on new roles .
and it &apos;s in that spirit that I want to introduce you to one last friend , very quickly .
let &apos;s talk dirty .
it &apos;s a very potent weapon of mass destruction .
it &apos;s got nutrients in it .
they &apos;re cutting down on deforestation , and they &apos;ve found a fuel supply that is inexhaustible , infinite and free at the point of production .
some visitors came , using various behavioral change tricks like putting out a plate of food and a plate of shit and watching the flies go one to the other .
Abed would say , &quot; I &apos;m sorry . &quot;
I &apos;d been told that in an Arab town , one need only mention the name of a local and it will be recognized .
&quot; yes , I suffered . &quot;
&quot; well , &quot; he said , &quot; I once went 60 in a 40 . &quot;
yes , contrast .
so I quit my company and started a career as a professional performer .
so this is very much like choosing the correct station on the radio dial .
so we now know how to find these trouble@@ makers and tell them , &quot; G@@ ent@@ le@@ men , that &apos;s enough .
so what we &apos;ve decided to do is we &apos;re going to try to tur@@ bo@@ charge the memory circuits in the brain .
can we get those areas of the brain to use glucose once again ?
it &apos;s much less reflective -- very different from writing .
now what if we could achieve that historic two-@@ percent growth for the next 70 years ?
but I &apos;m now going to give you an experiment .
hurricane Sandy caused a lot of people to lose the 20th century , maybe for a couple of days , in some cases for more than a week , electricity , running water , heating , gasoline for their cars , and a charge for their iPhones .
your challenge is , can you match what we achieved ?
but I really like that , so I wrote a book called &quot; The La@@ ws of S@@ impli@@ city . &quot;
last year at TED , these were all my titles . I had a lot of titles .
I feel kind of bad about that .
the three keys are easy to eat , so this is an@@ ago , cooked already , so easy to eat .
it &apos;s such a joy to sort of experience everything in the world .
sure . it &apos;s the computer .
we shape our destiny , and just as the earlier generations of managers needed to redesign their factories , we &apos;re going to need to reinvent our organizations and even our whole economic system .
today , millions of Americans do have faster , cheaper , more accurate tax preparation , and the founders of In@@ tu@@ it have done very well for themselves .
there is no Photoshop involved .
if an artwork is to touch someone , it must be the result of not only technique , but also the artist &apos;s thinking and struggle in life .
plugging all those electrons and the energy it takes to hold them in the correct place for you to see the video , into that formula , we can figure out that one minute of YouTube video increases the mass of your computer by about 10 to the negative 19th grams .
when I started working at Google in 2006 , Facebook was just a two-year-old , and Twitter hadn &apos;t yet been born .
he said , &quot; You know in &apos; Tom and Jerry , &apos; when Jerry wants to escape , and then Tom locks the door and swal@@ lows the key and you see it bul@@ ging out of his throat as it travels down ? &quot;
and of course , I really could see the image that he was describing , and I really did connect with the feeling that he was trying to convey , which was one of doom , when you know there &apos;s no way out .
and because violent extremism isn &apos;t confined to any one language , religion or ideology , the Re@@ direct M@@ eth@@ od is now being deployed globally to protect people being cour@@ ted online by violent ide@@ ologues , whether they &apos;re Islamists , white supre@@ m@@ acists or other violent extremists , with the goal of giving them the chance to hear from someone on the other side of that journey ; to give them the chance to choose a different path .
that means we &apos;re actually losing spaces online to meet and exchange ideas .
&quot; break a leg at TED ! &quot;
right now I can see you , and I can gauge how what I &apos;m saying is landing with you .
that means that we can have dialogue between people with different politics , different worldviews , different values .
( Applause ) Thank you .
now , multiple AMI constructs can be created for the control and sensation of multiple prosthetic joints .
when the bionic limb moves , the AMI muscles move back and forth , sending signals through the nerve to the brain , enabling a person wearing the prosthesis to experience natural sensations of positions and movements of the prosthesis .
for example , one day in the lab , he accidentally stepped on a roll of electrical tape .
in this 21st century , I believe humans will become superheroes .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m actually tracking the carbon dioxide you exhale in the room right now .
we broadcast a chemical signature of our emotions .
you may think that &apos;s impossible .
I mean , they &apos;re Newtonian objects .
they can have a precise idea of where they are , and sort of a vague idea of where the other cars are .
I can tell you exactly what happens .
( Applause )
like the ladies in Nashville , the detective thinks that vultures circling in the sky will lead him to the body .
I also went through my experiences with trapping and GPS tagging vultures .
you &apos;re not likely going to see the vultures at the crime scene .
but what about the pop-up menu where you put in your state ?
there &apos;s the definition as you type .
double click the word .
you can just type over it .
you &apos;ll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking , and in the way that you do , you &apos;ll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas .
it &apos;s about perfecting something old , and bringing something old into the 21st century .
that &apos;s someone who is designing a habitat on another planet &apos;s dream .
it &apos;s either poverty , low attendance , negative peer influences ...
it &apos;s the connection . it &apos;s the relationships .
very few things went to the market .
and one day photography made a total invasion in my life .
I have seven sisters . I &apos;m one of the only men in my family , and they made together the decision to transfer this land to L@@ é@@ ila and myself .
we created an incredible amount of pictures , and the result -- L@@ é@@ lia did the design of all my books , the design of all my shows . she is the creator of the shows .
and so there &apos;s companies like fac@@ e@@ .com that now have about 18 billion faces online .
and if that &apos;s true , then what we want to do is we want to go through four lessons from the Greeks and one lesson from a Latin American .
and that , of course , is what we are all now threatened with today because of electronic tattoos .
you know , I grew up in the inner city , and there were kids who were failing in schools 56 years ago when I first went to school , and those schools are still lousy today , 56 years later .
you say , who@@ o ! so I heard about that in &apos; 75 when I was at the Ed School at Harvard .
right ? this idea , zero to three .
you &apos;re going to go and teach this year .
because in my older years , I &apos;ve become somewhat of a cl@@ air@@ voy@@ ant .
so here &apos;s the other issue that I just think we &apos;ve got to be concerned about .
we &apos;ve got to give them all of these opportunities .
JL : well , thank you Dr. Canada .
what struck me was that IQ was not the only difference between my best and my worst students .
but then , they were very surprised when I graduated from high school .
and we created the San Fer@@ nando Institute for Ap@@ p@@ lied Media .
now one response you can make to this , and I sometimes have done this in talks , is people can talk about , there are benefits for these programs in reducing special ed and remedi@@ al education costs , there are benefits , parents care about preschool , maybe we &apos;ll get some migration effects from parents seeking good preschool , and I think those are true , but in some sense they &apos;re missing the point .
I learned new characters every day during the course of the next 15 years .
I march down hallways cleaned up after me every day by regular janitors , but I never have the dec@@ ency to honor their names .
( Laughter ) Because whoever thought of that title gets irony .
from an economic point of view , this is good math , isn &apos;t it , that we should do this ?
the trouble is , it &apos;s all going in the wrong direction .
now , they rank number one across the board , in reading , math and science , and one of the keys to Shanghai &apos;s incredible success is the way they help teachers keep improving .
building this system will also require a considerable investment .
the impact for teachers would be phenomenal .
I rarely actually quote anything , so I &apos;m going to try and find a piece of paper if I can , &#91; in &#93; which somebody , at the end of last year , ven@@ tured the thought about what for that individual , as a kind of important observer , analyst , writer -- a guy called Thomas Friedman , who wrote in the Her@@ ald Tri@@ bun@@ e , about 2006 .
hence my motto : green is the new red , white and blue . &quot;
it &apos;s another subject . it &apos;s another conversation .
that story , in terms of buildings , started in the late &apos; 60s , early &apos; 70s .
now Alex walked into her first session wearing jeans and a big slou@@ chy top , and she dropped onto the couch in my office and kicked off her fl@@ ats and told me she was there to talk about guy problems .
so when we think about child development , we all know that the first five years are a critical period for language and attachment in the brain .
nothing happens .
it &apos;s funny , someone just mentioned Mac@@ Gy@@ ver , because that was , like , I loved it , and when I was seven , I taped a fork to a drill and I was like , &quot; Hey , Mom , I &apos;m going to O@@ live Garden . &quot;
this is a little piano circuit right in here , and this is an ordinary paintbrush that I smashed it together with . ( be@@ eping ) And so , with some ketchup , - ( musical notes ) - and then I can kind of - ( musical notes ) - ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And that &apos;s awesome , right ?
we should all be participating in changing the way the world works together .
I &apos;m not a geri@@ atri@@ cian .
it &apos;s true .
in both cases , last days are about quiet reassurance .
tape a set to your refrigerator .
woman : this is it . we &apos;re on in two minutes .
it was like cell phones strapped to your head .
as I thought , that &apos;s most of you .
it does help us to put perspective on our situation .
this is the website of the Bill &amp; amp ; Melinda Gates Foundation , and if you look at the words on the top right-hand side , it says , &quot; All lives have equal value . &quot;
here &apos;s one risk of extinction that we all became aware of recently , when an asteroid passed close to our planet .
so , when I was in art school , I developed a shake in my hand , and this was the straigh@@ test line I could draw .
I was making all these scribble pictures .
I had this horrible little set of tools , and I felt like I could do so much more with the supplies I thought an artist was supposed to have .
so about a year and a half ago , we started working on a project called Wiki@@ House , and Wiki@@ House is an open-source construction system .
like , never designing a piece that can &apos;t be lifted up .
what happens to education in that context ?
so eight minutes and an embedded computer seemed to be all that we needed there .
basic Windows functions , browsing , painting , chatting and email , games and educational material , music downloads , playing video .
and such a set of spec@@ s should produce the technology to address remoteness , values and violence .
I might look successful and happy being in front of you today , but I once suffered from severe depression and was in total despair .
and the preservation is , again , like those insects in &#91; amber &#93; , phenomenal .
so you have teeth , bones with blood which look like blood , you have hair , and you have intact carcasses or heads which still have brains in them .
and using state-of-the-art clean room technology , we &apos;ve devised ways that we can actually pull these D@@ NA@@ s away from all the rest of the gun@@ k in there , and it &apos;s not surprising to any of you sitting in the room that if I take a mammoth bone or a tooth and I extract its DNA that I &apos;ll get mammoth DNA , but I &apos;ll also get all the bacteria that once lived with the mammoth , and , more complicated , I &apos;ll get all the DNA that survived in that environment with it , so the bacteria , the fungi , and so on and so forth .
it feels like you &apos;re re@@ tic@@ ent there , and yet you &apos;ve given us a vision of it being so possible .
I think it &apos;s just that we have to think very deeply about the implications , ramifications of our actions , and so as long as we have good , deep discussion like we &apos;re having now , I think we can come to a very good solution as to why to do it .
but then there was another wonderfully pret@@ entious article that came out in The New Republic , so pret@@ entious , by Li@@ el Lei@@ bo@@ vit@@ z , and it said , &quot; MoMA has mistaken video games for art . &quot; again .
so it &apos;s so fantastic to see how these feathers that were ru@@ ff@@ led , and these reactions , were so ve@@ he@@ ment .
interestingly , I learned that it &apos;s considered that in design and in the design collection , what you see is what you get .
Thank you very much .
what &apos;s going on with men ? why do so many men rape women in our society and around the world ?
it &apos;s called kill the messenger .
in the end , what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends .
it &apos;s scary , when you think about it , how many years .
and harnessed correctly , it can be a powerful force for good .
I satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians . &#91; &quot; correspondence in the Family of F@@ ou Le@@ i &quot; &#93; I found my role model of an independent woman when Confucian tradition requires obedience . &#91; &quot; Jane E@@ y@@ re &quot; &#93; And I learned to be efficient from this book . &#91; &quot; cheaper by the Do@@ zen &quot; &#93; And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these .
&quot; the Good Earth &quot; is about Chinese peasant life .
so I thought , well , if comparative reading works for research , why not do it in daily life too ?
and last year , the president of the United States came out in favor of gay marriage .
( Laughter ) We have to think about how we feel about cures altogether .
and ultimately , I feel that in the same way that we test fla@@ me-@@ retar@@ dant pajamas in an infer@@ no to ensure they won &apos;t catch fire when our child reaches across the stove , so these stories of families negotiating these extreme differences reflect on the universal experience of parenting , which is always that sometimes , you look at your child , and you think , &quot; Where did you come from ? &quot;
what I &apos;m studying is how much love there can be , even when everything appears to be going wrong . &quot;
I thought a lot about the mother of one disabled child I had seen , a severely disabled child who died through caregiver neglect .
police officers were taking bribes from haw@@ kers who were haw@@ king on the streets .
don &apos;t forget the key principles : naming , shaming and jail@@ ing .
CA : so someone sued you in court , and they took you there , and you were in rem@@ and custody for part of it , and you did that deliberately .
I mean , everybody has their hazard .
we know that their brain-@@ to-@@ body ratio , which is a physical measure of intelligence , is second only to humans .
now , researchers have actually measured whistle complexity using information theory , and whistles rate very high relative to even human languages .
they might do it in captivity , but in the wild -- So we built a portable keyboard that we could push through the water , and we labeled four objects they like to play with , the scarf , rope , sargassum , and also had a bow ride , which is a fun activity for a dolphin . ( whistle ) And that &apos;s the scarf whistle , which is also associated with a visual symbol .
but as we decode their natural sounds , we &apos;re also planning to put those back into the computerized system .
and if you go back about 50 years , Bill and Ted were leading remarkably similar lives .
the school stopped in third grade , so then I entered the public school system , and it felt like I had been sent to the G@@ ul@@ ag .
but this last time , just coming round , right now , suddenly , there &apos;d be huge changes in the environment , in the concentration of people , and it was just unbelievable , the amount of -- all the change in it .
( Laughter ) ( P@@ aper ru@@ stling ) Well , that &apos;ll be all the slides .
( Laughter ) Narrator : and He@@ li@@ os now begins the process of turning her back to the sun , to maximize the power from her solar array .
( Laughter ) Okay , this one will be a left turn .
yet this is the kind of movie that I wanted to make ever since I was a kid , really , back when I was reading some comic books and dreaming about what the future might be .
I did &quot; Mars et Av@@ ril &quot; for only 2.3 million .
his career I admire a lot .
how do you get something that you can &apos;t afford ?
and this guy is another guy I admire a lot , and I wanted him to be involved in the movie as a production designer .
so here I was with one of my childhood heroes , drawing every single frame that &apos;s in the film to turn that into Montreal in the future .
a lot of people stop believing anyone at all and this is even more dangerous .
when we see something interesting , it &apos;s often automatic .
look at other sites .
it &apos;s the only way to stop this culture of fake news .
and when you show up to play baseball , nobody needs to talk about what we &apos;re going to do or how this baseball game might be good for us .
you just take your position and play the game .
well , you have pizza when you &apos;re hungry for pizza .
you may even negotiate it .
so I &apos;m scared we won &apos;t have enough robots .
it &apos;s got a little bit of basic common sense , goes and picks the objects .
and so three days later , driving very fast , I found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell , capable of producing grape@@ fru@@ it-@@ size hail and spectacular tornadoes , although only two percent actually do .
using this pointer , made out of reflective markers , I can point to where I want the quad to be in space a fixed distance away from me .
in this instance , this knowledge allows us to design novel machine architectures or to design clever algorithms that gracefully handle damage , just like human athletes do , instead of building machines with redundancy .
mathematical models are used to continuously re-@@ plan a cooperative strategy 50 times per second .
you may not recognize me because I used to part my hair differently there .
they find me up on the top terrace .
let &apos;s see how we can bring people back to the process .
and that means very soon drones will tell humans what to look at , not the other way around .
they &apos;ll know their mission objective , and they &apos;ll react to new circumstances without human guidance .
now if responsibility and transparency are two of the corner@@ stones of representative government , autonomous robotic weapons could undermine both .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , I think there are tons of great uses for unarmed civilian drones : environmental monitoring , search and rescue , logistics .
and every citizen should be able to download an app that shows the population of drones and autonomous vehicles moving through public spaces around them , both right now and historically .
a courageous woman , her name is Naj@@ la Har@@ ir@@ i , she &apos;s a Saudi woman in the city of Je@@ dd@@ ah , she drove a car and she announced but she didn &apos;t record a video .
it strips it away of its strongest weapon : fear .
I &apos;m pretty sure when I was in jail , everyone saw titles in the international media something like this during these nine days I was in jail .
well , perhaps because , in the last 15 years we have come out of our ivory tower , and started to publish ex ante -- and I stress the term ex ante , it means &quot; in advance &quot; - before the crash confirmed the existence of the bubble or the financial exc@@ esses .
I want you to select one of them and note the position of that house and keep that in your head .
if you get a red cross , well , I &apos;ve looked carefully around the room and it &apos;s not going to make much difference to this crew .
and before you get offended and leave , I &apos;ve got to say that being too old , in this case , means that pretty much everyone in the room , I think , is over five years of age .
well , first thing we do , we get showers working .
well over 1,000 people use those toilets .
&#91; DIY Ne@@ ur@@ os@@ cience &#93; So what makes the dragonfly one of the most successful predators in the animal kingdom ?
look at that , but it &apos;s only in one direction .
GG : both were there , but like most kids , they choose not to eat the broccoli , and they go switch to something swee@@ ter .
the rural areas are no longer producing as much food as they did .
what will happen if the billion people today who live on less than one dollar a day rise to three billion in the next 30 years ?
this is not something that happens far away to people that we don &apos;t know .
this disease is called sudden wealth syndrome . ( Laughter ) It &apos;s an amazing phenomenon .
when we had almost eradicated smallpox , it came back again , because the company town of T@@ at@@ anag@@ ar drew laborers , who could come there and get employment .
clearly I have a German mother somewhere .
all the while , we also wanted to give back to the local tech community that helped us grow Ushahidi and supported us in those early days .
it acts as a backup to the Internet so that , when the power goes out , it fails over and connects to the nearest G@@ SM network .
so I started to steal from food carts in illegal markets .
textbooks and the library were not my playground .
we &apos;ve allowed Judaism to be claimed by violently messi@@ anic West Bank settlers , Christianity by hom@@ ophobic hypo@@ cr@@ ites and misogy@@ n@@ istic bi@@ g@@ ots , Islam by suicide bombers .
this isn &apos;t faith .
and as she did , other ones came to mind .
it was in the skating r@@ ink .
if we make a protest , if we protest against the Iraq War , nothing changes , so why bother ?
and this included fishing nations , like China , Japan , Spain , Russia .
but most important , I was left with these three burning questions that wouldn &apos;t go away : how did this happen to me if I was supposedly doing everything right ?
now , imagine we thought bruises were the problem , and we evolved a giant medical establishment and a culture around treating bruises : masking cre@@ ams , painkillers , you name it , all the while ignoring the fact that people are still banging their sh@@ ins into coffee tables .
getting the cause and the effect right makes all the difference in the world .
we know that 30 million obese Americans in the United States don &apos;t have insulin resistance .
I have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this , but I &apos;m wide open to others .
I &apos;d say , as a doctor , I delivered the best clinical care I could , but as a human being , I let you down .
in general , that seems like a funny cartoon , but let &apos;s look what online survey I did .
( Laughter ) So in dealing with humor in the context of The New Yorker , you have to see , where is that tiger going to be ?
with respect to idea drawings , nowhere in the contract is the word &quot; cartoon &quot; mentioned .
no . Nah . no .
now , I &apos;m not suggesting we want to raise our babies in our stomach , but I am suggesting it &apos;s possible we might want to manage ga@@ stri@@ c secre@@ tion in the gut .
and then we took the dead nucleus from the dead tissue of the extinct frog and we inserted those nuclei into that egg .
it would &apos;ve kept the curator very happy , but it wasn &apos;t going to keep us happy .
I &apos;ve been to Tasmania .
as far as I &apos;m concerned , this is why we &apos;re trying to do these kinds of de-@@ extinction projects .
we are trying to restore that balance of nature that we have upset .
are we brave enough to welcome it ?
I need to think about this more . &quot;
and of all the places in the solar system that we might go to and search for answers to questions like this , there &apos;s Saturn . and we have been to Saturn before -- we visited Saturn in the early 1980s -- but our investigations of Saturn have become far more in-@@ depth in detail since the Cassini spacecraft , traveling across interplanetary space for seven years , gli@@ ded into orbit around Saturn in the summer of 2004 , and became at that point the farthest robotic out@@ post that humanity had ever established around the Sun .
now , the Saturn system is a rich planetary system .
and then , here &apos;s a beautiful composite of the Whir@@ l@@ pool Galaxy , taken by the Hubble Space Telescope .
it can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills , down into the low@@ lands . so stop and think for a minute .
and I just want to emphasize how significant an event this is .
but as if that weren &apos;t brilliant enough , we can spot , in this beautiful image , sight of our own planet , cra@@ dled in the arms of Saturn &apos;s rings .
who here can &apos;t remember thinking , well , looking and finding shapes in the clouds when they were kids ?
( Laughter ) Or maybe you see a top@@ less sun@@ ba@@ ther .
but I wondered , what if there could be no boundary at all ?
first , I created this tool which penetrates into the digital space , so when you press it hard on the screen , it transfers its physical body into pixels .
( music ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) ( Music ends ) ( Applause ) TM : Thank you very much .
remember that 80 percent is destined to be lost .
and it is through this structure that mutual exchanges will occur .
if you recall the graphs I showed you earlier , 85 percent of phosphorus is lost in the soil , and the plants are unable to access it .
and in some cases , in Cuba , Mexico and India , the dose can be reduced to 25 percent , and in several other cases , there &apos;s no need to add any phosphorus at all , because the mushrooms are so well adapted to finding phosphorus and drawing it from the soil .
a recent study by the World Bank looked at 200 cases of corruption .
and now forgive me , I &apos;m going to read the next bit because it &apos;s a very live issue , and our lawyers have been through this in some detail and they want me to get it right .
that &apos;s the change .
I &apos;m just going to focus on a few of them , and let &apos;s start with fire , because I think fire is probably the first one that you &apos;re all thinking about right now .
not long ago , we didn &apos;t have self-driving cars .
this is the definition of artificial general intelligence -- AGI , which has been the holy gra@@ il of AI research since its inception .
( Laughter ) We invented the car , screwed up a bunch of times -- invented the traffic light , the seat belt and the airbag , but with more powerful technology like nuclear weapons and AGI , learning from mistakes is a lousy strategy , don &apos;t you think ?
I &apos;ve been very interested in understanding the nature of the intelligence of dolphins for the past 30 years .
we used to think this was a uniquely human ability , but we learned that the great apes , our closest relatives , also show this ability .
we are not alone .
so the dolphins could hit a key , a symbol , they heard a computer-generated whistle , and they got an object or activity .
and the possibility of making a web server for a dollar grew into what became known as the Internet of Things , which is literally an industry now with tremendous implications for health care , energy efficiency .
( Laughter ) And what I had found was an article that listed a database of over 8,000 different proteins that are found when you have pancreatic cancer .
( Laughs ) You start with some water , pour in some nanotubes , add antibodies , mix it up , take some paper , dip it , dry it , and you can detect cancer .
you can see that the stream is still represented in the bottom third of the page , but notice what &apos;s missing in the top two thirds .
whether or not we understand it is a different story .
( Gro@@ wling ) Thank you for listening .
and eight months after my house burned down , I ran into a friend who taught at a local high school , and he said , &quot; I &apos;ve got the perfect place for you . &quot;
that means identifying and quantifying our assets .
we simply have to find the momentum happening in our city .
they are where the One Per@@ cent was 30 years ago .
one of the reasons , I think , is a sort of boiled frog phenomenon .
and why stop at just playing the global political and economic system as it exists to your own maximum advantage ?
why ?
her name is J@@ ini Kim .
remember , the ho@@ ws are the key results .
what really matters is the why that we pour into those vessels .
if we think of the world-changing goals of an Intel , of a N@@ una , of Bono , of Google , they &apos;re remarkable : ubiquitous computing , affordable health care , high-quality for everyone , ending global poverty , access to all the world &apos;s information .
what keeps you up at night ?
eventually , exhaustion catches up with all of us .
this clock , or cir@@ cadian rhythm , is also sensitive to light , so avoid bright lights at night to help tell your body that it &apos;s time for sleep .
there &apos;s three particular things that I &apos;ve done , and I &apos;ll just describe those first , and then talk about some of my work .
( scratching ) So I have a cross@@ f@@ ader , and I have the two dec@@ ks .
you care about science , philosophy , music , art , whatever -- it &apos;s no good if you &apos;re a zombie or in a coma , right ?
right ? the liquidity is not an extra juice squir@@ ted out by the H@@ 2@@ O molecules .
or is it ob@@ ser@@ ver-@@ relative ?
either a conscious agent is carrying out the computation , or he &apos;s got a piece of machinery that adm@@ its of a computational interpretation .
and you know , it was not a failure for ourselves in itself , but it was a failure that will impact his full life .
he was looking at us .
and we thank you so much , all of you .
I &apos;m five years old , and I am very proud .
so we take the pizza , our very first pizza , and we dev@@ our slice after slice as the deli@@ ver@@ yman stands there and stares at us from the doorway .
and now , these days , she eats organic food and she sleeps on an orthopedic bed with her name on it , but when we pour water for her in her bowl , she still looks up and she w@@ ags her tail in gratitude .
( Applause )
I grew up in a small neighborhood in Jerusalem .
the other is more flexible , vibrating only in the presence of longer wavelength , low-frequency sounds .
that &apos;s a sea sponge that has a fiber optic .
that &apos;s very exciting for fuel cells -- to be able to do that without platinum .
that &apos;s a ball of water , and those are dirt particles .
that is , those organisms that have not been able to figure out how to enhance or swee@@ ten their places , are not around to tell us about it .
we are unique . we are irreplaceable .
what I would like to do now is to tell you a little bit about how I work . let &apos;s take &quot; The Lion King . &quot;
I start with the notion of the ide@@ ograph .
three strokes , you get the whole bamboo forest .
and you see the mechanics .
Sebastian : draw thy sword .
I prefer you to see people moving , and you &apos;re going , &quot; Whoa , what was that ? &quot;
it &apos;s right there in the palm of both of our hands , of all of my company &apos;s hands .
we streamed data from the bedside instruments in their pediatric intensive care so that we could both look at the data in real time and , more importantly , to store the data so that we could start to learn from it .
now , in motor racing , we &apos;re all a little bit ambitious , audacious , a little bit arrogant sometimes , so we decided we would also look at the children as they were being transported to intensive care .
so we have a very ambitious program .
we have an approach which , if it &apos;s successful , there &apos;s no reason why it should stay within a hospital .
he was disgusted when talking to me , as if he was saying to himself , &quot; If this was the last girl on Earth , I wouldn &apos;t look at her ! &quot;
it definitely hurts !
should I forget all my culture , thoughts , intellect and all my memories ?
they &apos;d go back to being consumers , clu@@ eless consumers , like we are most of the time .
so when we say , &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; each one of you draws a specific image in their own mind , there are specific feelings of a specific day in a specific historical period .
second , there are many other things that we can do .
and I &apos;m still on that mission .
and the thing is , I &apos;m a bit older and wiser now , and I know that there &apos;s some noises I &apos;ll never be able to make because I &apos;m he@@ mmed in by my physical body , and there &apos;s things it can &apos;t do .
but if you want to do something a little bit more immediate , something that you can &apos;t achieve with live lo@@ oping , there &apos;s other ways to layer your voice up .
there &apos;s no samples . there &apos;s no synthe@@ sizers .
what do I win if I convince you that utilit@@ arianism isn &apos;t really the right framework for thinking about ethical theories ?
and one more thing .
what did you gain , cognitively , from convincing me ?
but I have some suggestions .
( video ) Jin@@ so@@ p Lee : Hey , my name &apos;s Jin@@ so@@ p , and today , I &apos;m going to show you what riding motor@@ bikes is like from the point of view of the five senses . Hey !
and that &apos;s what this theory taught me about my field .
here &apos;s the experience you all had while listening to the TED Talks .
some logos designed by my students .
so it &apos;s a speci@@ al-@@ interest writing system .
next door , in Sierra Leone , the Men@@ de also developed a syllab@@ ary , but theirs reads from right to left .
I just realized this is going to be recorded , isn &apos;t it ? right . okay .
this is a photo of you , Derek , playing at the Bar@@ bi@@ can with the Royal Phil@@ harmonic P@@ ops .
DP : &quot; Chop@@ sticks . &quot;
so this is one of Derek &apos;s heroes .
over two million people became refugees .
we built 50 units to do that as a monitoring test for the dur@@ ability and moisture and termites , so on .
and he said , &quot; Oh God , are you crazy ?
then I wonder , what is a permanent and what is a temporary building ?
for instance , we &apos;re taught to say &quot; the theory of evolution . &quot;
( Laughter ) As life evolves , it also goes extinct .
but nowhere else anyway .
and then subsequently , &quot; Never Mind the Bol@@ locks , Here &apos;s the Sex Pi@@ st@@ ols , &quot; the word bol@@ locks , the police decided was a rude word and so we were arrested for using the word bol@@ locks on the Sex Pi@@ st@@ ols &apos; album .
you know , the alternative , communism , has not worked .
it &apos;s got to be consistent .
and so , therefore it &apos;s -- Sorry .
this is donated by a social scientist , and they said they didn &apos;t know what it was or indeed , how to use it , so -- ( Laughter ) Sorry .
but what you must be so aware of is that alcohol doesn &apos;t provide sleep .
so a quick show of hands .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) OK .
look at it here : 39 digits long , proven to be prime in 18@@ 76 by a mathematician called Lucas .
Lucas again , in 18@@ 76 , showed us ( 2 ^ 67 ) - 1 , 21 digits long , was not prime .
we live in an age where some of the great breakthroughs are not going to happen in the labs or the halls of academia but on laptops , desk@@ tops , in the palms of people &apos;s hands who are simply helping out for the search .
the first annual all-@@ wom@@ en@@ -and-@@ girls race for empowerment , which is one of its kind in the region , has just taken place only a few weeks ago , with 4,@@ 5@@ 12 women , including the first lady , and this is only the beginning .
and also , there &apos;s way more cells in your brain than the number of straws in a typical haystack .
are we going to bring back the fear memory for the first box into this completely new environment ?
anyone ?
yeah . me too .
it primes you to do things that strengthen close relationships .
it seems amazing to me that a belief about stress can make so much difference to someone &apos;s life expectancy .
and so I would say that &apos;s really the best way to make decisions , is go after what it is that creates meaning in your life and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows .
I was as reckless and foolish as only young men can be .
and I found myself sort of scratching at the walls of life , as if I was trying to find a way out into a wider space beyond .
one of the many post-@@ rational excuses made by the Japanese government for killing whales is that they said , &quot; Well , the number of fish and krill will rise and then there &apos;ll be more for people to eat . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t try to produce a he@@ ath or a meadow or a rain forest or a kelp garden or a coral reef .
my grandfather was a cab driver for 40 years .
and we tell the stories of being inside the towers through that same audio collage , so you &apos;re hearing people literally talking about seeing the planes as they make their way into the building , or making their way down the stair@@ wells .
so suddenly what is this un@@ differentiated , anonymous group of names springs into reality as an individual life .
one of the reasons I agreed to give this talk today was that I was hoping that Lo@@ is would be here so I could introduce you to her and publicly thank her .
in 1974 , the great Ray Kurzweil , the American inventor , worked on building a machine that would scan books and read them out in synthetic speech .
in no other Latin American country are there more than a couple of thousand .
I don &apos;t know what a plot means .
and then I want to tell you that this is a map .
so -- and that &apos;s a song about how everybody &apos;s miserable because , you know , we &apos;re from Russia .
( Laughter ) And I would like to run it for them .
so anyway , let me change pace a little bit .
using the email address , the telephone number and the GPS data , on the left you see an advert for a BMW that one of our cybercriminals is selling , on the other side an advert for the sale of sp@@ hy@@ n@@ x kittens .
this woman was Maria , and Maria is the wife of one of our cybercriminals .
interesting idea .
so Frank is sitting at a desk .
for example , the cocktail effect : you &apos;re in a party , having conversations with someone , and yet you can recognize your name without realizing you were listening to that .
once a guy had a hole in his pocket , and that was rather trauma@@ tizing for me .
put your hand up a little bit higher , but watch it close .
I mean , opening a door , you don &apos;t require much precision .
if you take a robot arm , it &apos;s a very well-@@ defined set of rigid links and motors , what we call actuators , they move the links about the joints .
there &apos;s over 20,000 species of bees in the world , and they &apos;re absolutely gorgeous .
now this society has no central authority .
and we started growing larger and larger crop mono@@ cultures .
if one of these ne@@ onics , we call them , is applied in a high concentration , such as in this ground application , enough of the compound moves through the plant and gets into the pollen and the nectar , where a bee can consume , in this case , a high dose of this neuro@@ toxin that makes the bee twitch and die .
we can &apos;t really afford to lose that many more .
and they &apos;re looking at energy technology and nuclear fusion .
there &apos;s another one about personal health and nutrition .
what if , instead of starting with a complex and sentient animal , we started with what the tissues are made of , the basic unit of life , the cell ?
this process does no harm , and Daisy the cow can live a happy life .
cities endure the ages .
no head of state would be permitted by their security details to do it , nor be in a position to do it .
and we asked other people , how fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other ?
I have to get out of here actually . I have to go read .
so I &apos;d say the model we want to take is not that we start out kind of ignorant and we get some facts together and then we gain knowledge .
they were things like , why is the largest city of a state rarely the capital ?
and if we find that a person is competent in the relevant matters , and reliable and honest , we &apos;ll have a pretty good reason to trust them , because they &apos;ll be trustworthy .
so in the end , I think what we are aiming for is not very difficult to discern .
it &apos;s a massive problem .
that &apos;s the stigma .
the first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one .
so he says , &quot; All right . &quot;
he &apos;s not going to fight him that way . why would he ?
Goliath is a sitting duck . he doesn &apos;t have a chance .
is she really saying that these people live with the bodies of their dead relatives ?
and that &apos;s exactly what I &apos;m saying .
so again , I started doing some math .
in fact , he didn &apos;t even bother looking at the menu .
and I guess the one variable that I haven &apos;t considered is the competition .
she listed her job as &quot; teacher . &quot;
so I created 10 fake male profiles .
so this is a word cloud highlighting the most popular words that were used by the most popular women , words like &quot; fun &quot; and &quot; girl &quot; and &quot; love . &quot;
the first one has to do with making sound visible .
the Apollo program was the greatest peace@@ time mobilization in the history of the United States .
here &apos;s a question we need to rethink together : what should be the role of money and markets in our societies ?
imagine that you are the head of a major school system , and someone comes to you with this proposal .
MS : now , let &apos;s see if there &apos;s someone who favors , who thinks it &apos;s worth trying this .
now these are controversial questions , and so we tend to shrink from them .
but once we see that markets change the character of goods , we have to debate among ourselves these bigger questions about how to value goods .
but I think at this moment , we &apos;ve been at this for quite a while .
it &apos;s capitalism as it was ultimately meant to be , meeting important needs , not incrementally competing for trivial differences in product attributes and market share .
the governments that are making the most progress are the governments that have found ways to enable shared value in business rather than see government as the only player that has to call the shots .
and the lesson from New York over the past six years is that you can update this asset .
so we worked hard to change that balance , and probably the best example of our new approach is in Times Square .
and I work for a data-driven mayor , as you probably know .
you can have fun with paint .
since we &apos;ve launched the program , three million trips have been taken .
the eb@@ bs and flows of hostility have not shifted with ideological ze@@ al , but rather with changes in the geopolitical landscape .
and I gave his parents some guidance to follow .
if you look at the first slide there , that &apos;s the temporal lobes , frontal lobes , pari@@ etal lobes , OK -- the lobes that constitute the brain .
believe it or not , even with internal visc@@ era .
it &apos;ll pat his brother on the shoulder , it &apos;ll answer the phone when it rings , it &apos;ll wave goodbye .
he &apos;s going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving , right ?
&quot; Oh my God , oh my God , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;
and I said , &quot; Derek , does this bother you ? &quot;
C sharp is blue , F sharp is green , another tone might be yellow , right ?
this is called synesthesia . Galton called it synesthesia , a ming@@ ling of the senses .
so , if there &apos;s a gene causing this tri@@ mming and if that gene mutates , then you get deficient tri@@ mming between adjacent brain areas .
but I landed in a refugee situation that had a million refugees in 40 camps , and there were six of us doctors .
and then we asked the question , well what really predicts a case of violence ?
but of course , the funders said , &quot; Wait a second , do it again . &quot;
when this woman falls to her death .
Elli@@ ott told me later she wrote the whole thing with her thumbs .
things like Invisible Obama or the famous &quot; bin@@ ders full of women &quot; that came up during the 2012 election cycle , or even the fan fiction universe of &quot; West W@@ ing &quot; Twitter in which you have all of these accounts for every single one of the characters in &quot; The West W@@ ing , &quot; including the bird that taps at Josh Ly@@ man &apos;s window in one single episode . ( Laughter ) All of these are rapid iterations on a theme .
however , through a network of state-@@ owned enterprises , the Chinese have been able to go into these rural areas , using their companies to help deliver on these healthcare solutions .
just to illustrate , I went into my ann@@ als of myself .
I bring this to you to tell you that in 40 years , I &apos;ve gone from not being recognized as a human being to standing in front of the illu@@ stri@@ ous TED crowd today to talk to you about my views .
ultimately , it &apos;s about transforming the world and making it a better place .
and there &apos;s an alternative .
so these are the three arguments that I &apos;m going to give you quickly today .
working families , which are defined as earning between 20,000 and 50,000 dollars a year in America are spending more now on transportation than on housing , slightly more , because of this phenomenon called &quot; drive till you qualify , &quot; finding homes further and further and further from the city centers and from their jobs , so that they &apos;re locked in this , two , three hours , four hours a day of commuting .
twenty-five percent of young men and 40 percent of young women are too heavy to enlist in our own military forces .
we have the first generation of children in America who are predicted to live shorter lives than their parents .
I believe that this American healthcare crisis that we &apos;ve all heard about is an urban design crisis , and that the design of our cities lies at the cure .
expecting some metabolic or DNA factor at work , they were shocked to learn that the only difference between the subjects that they could figure out was the amount they were moving , and that in fact those who gained weight were sitting , on average , two hours more per day than those who didn &apos;t .
Tul@@ sa : 14 per 100,000 .
their very purpose was to perform a mechanical function .
and this is an approach that &apos;s used all over the world , including in our lab .
now , at the time that we did this , this received a lot of attention in the press , because it was a really nice way of generating new bone , and we got many , many contacts from different people that were interested in using this .
and actually we know that those cells in the body , in the embryo , as they develop can form a different kind of tissue , cartilage , and so we developed a gel that was slightly different in nature and slightly different chemistry , put it in there , and we were able to get 100 percent cartilage instead .
and this approach works really well , I think , for pre-@@ planned procedures , but it &apos;s something you do have to pre-@@ plan .
like Makoko and the Tor@@ re David , throughout the Z@@ ab@@ baleen you &apos;ll find all the same facilities as in any typical neighborhood .
Thank you .
because it &apos;s impossible to know where these things are coming from .
Facebook -- Zuckerberg said much the same thing at Congress , when pressed about how they were going to moderate their stuff .
these issues of accountability and agency , of op@@ acity and complexity , of the violence and exploitation that inherently results from the concentration of power in a few hands -- these are much , much larger issues .
JB : thanks very much . cheers .
only jerk wasn &apos;t the word I used .
he was a Chinese scholar who later , in his 60s , got a Ph.D. in Chinese history .
it &apos;s a strong word , isn &apos;t it ?
the people are leaving . they &apos;re playing instruments .
to another group of subjects , we told them , &quot; Stu@@ dents and faculty will see your answers . &quot;
we can send emails that can only be read by the intended recipient , not even the NSA .
right now , many of us do not even know that the fight is going on , but it is , whether you like it or not .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) HP : okay . so this imitation business does come with risk .
did Africa feed itself ?
I am here to tell you that change is in the air .
but once it arrived , if no buyer was to be found , or if prices suddenly dropped , farmers would incu@@ r tremendous losses .
so all of this will transform farmers .
the last parliament of our century opened with our president announcing to the country that this was the most important economic initiative for the country today .
so be decisive on these issues .
so the message here is , measure what you care about and lead the change , and don &apos;t wait a hundred years .
ten years ago , say you &apos;re F@@ ox@@ con@@ n setting up an iPhone factory , by chance .
each little box is about a billion dollars , and you see that I pay an awful lot of attention to Nigeria sitting there in the middle .
fragile democracies is the be@@ i@@ ge color .
Jason and the Argonauts passed by their shores , barely avoiding their deadly arrows .
I don &apos;t know what cat gut is , but let &apos;s assume it &apos;s formidable .
when we feel jealous , we tell ourselves a story .
and this is the story he starts to tell himself , and from then on , Proust writes that every fresh charm S@@ wan@@ n detects in his mistress , he adds to his &quot; collection of instruments in his private torture chamber . &quot;
jealousy likes details .
our calculation shows that quantum tunneling of the Higgs field is not likely to occur in the next 10 to the 100 years , and this is a very long time .
and third is that their image has nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia .
but the question was how we could do a multi@@ story , contemporary building with these principles .
and it &apos;s nor@@ th-@@ south , because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and then a natural ventilation .
you and I can experience things without a story .
what happens when that arrow goes a@@ wry ?
now everybody agrees that thyroid cancers are sky high , and that Chernobyl evacu@@ ees suffer the trauma of relocated peoples everywhere : higher levels of anxiety , depression , alcoholism , unemployment and , importantly , disrupted social networks .
I find the stigma especially ironic , because I strongly believe that sanitation workers are the most important labor force on the streets of the city , for three reasons .
they have cultivated a brand of profession@@ alism , business acumen and innovation .
and so , differences aside , what these three organizations share is on the one hand , a very clear understanding that institutions cannot be imposed from the top , but rather they are built from the bottom up one interaction at a time .
in this case , this is in Peru .
and bridges are enormous features in our landscape -- not just enormous , sometimes there &apos;s small ones -- and they are really significant features , and I believe we have a duty to make our bridges beautiful .
in our world of construction , the changes seem positively glacial .
this is using Mess@@ ina Bridge as an example .
but if it &apos;s ugly or just dull , it will always be ugly or dull .
to reach clinical fru@@ ition rapidly , it was obvious : I had to think about the problem differently .
immediately , the paralyzed rat can stand .
the robot is transparent , just like you would hold a young child during the first insecure steps .
I would like you all to take a moment and dream with me .
and this is a radically new concept that may apply to other neurological disorders , what I termed &quot; personalized neuro@@ prosthetics , &quot; where by sensing and stimulating neural interfaces , I implanted throughout the nervous system , in the brain , in the spinal cord , even in peripheral nerves , based on patient-@@ specific impairments .
and every single one of these companies denies .
and there &apos;s more evidence supporting this theory as well .
all right , how many Swedish decision@@ makers and politicians and business leaders use , every day , U.S.@@ -based services , like , you know , run Windows or O@@ S@@ X , or use Facebook or LinkedIn , or store their data in clouds like i@@ Cloud or Sky@@ drive or Dro@@ p@@ Box , or maybe use online services like Amazon web services or sales support ?
part of it might be , and there are terrorists , but are we really thinking about terrorists as such an existential threat that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them ?
what am I sending to worry about this ? am I sending naked pictures or something ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So , what is there to be done ?
should we worry . no , we shouldn &apos;t worry .
we should be angry , because this is wrong , and it &apos;s rude , and it should not be done .
by building together open , free , secure systems , we can go around such surveillance , and then one country doesn &apos;t have to solve the problem by itself .
now , if we continue this process , we &apos;ll generate rectangles of the form 13 by 21 , 21 by 34 , and so on .
and besides , it &apos;s not like I was the first person ever to lose their sight .
and then I was also surprised by the city &apos;s propensity for kindness and care as opposed to indifference or worse .
if you &apos;re blind , you don &apos;t drive . ( Laughter ) They don &apos;t like it when you drive . ( Laughter ) If you design a city with the blind in mind , you design a city with a robust , accessible , well-@@ connected mass transit system that connects all parts of the city and the region all around .
blind people want to work too .
if we do not include young people in the growth of our cities , if we do not provide them opportunities , the story of wai@@ thood , the gateway to terrorism , to violence , to gangs , will be the story of cities 2.0 .
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings , Mohamed Moham@@ oud , a fl@@ orist .
he forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity .
and then they shot him .
there was no bailout on the horizon .
so I thought it was kind of cool when they came out with these positive lists and we were on there .
you know , these are cities that , typically , you &apos;re not embarrassed to be associated with .
( Laughter ) The national media gravit@@ ated toward this story immediately , and they really could have gone with it one of two ways .
but fortunately , the consensus was , &quot; Look , this is a problem in a lot of places .
we &apos;re going to try and get all , something like , I don &apos;t know , 1,500 thumbs in this room connected in a single node .
any Star Wars fans ?
I didn &apos;t see anybody sending text messages or checking their email while we were playing , so you were totally content to be playing .
common sense , a rare idea in the law , but here it was . common sense -- ( Laughter ) -- R@@ evol@@ ts at the idea . common sense .
digital technology is the opportunity for the revival of these vocal chords that he spoke so passionately to Congress about .
one side builds new technologies , such as one recently announced that will enable them to automatically take down from sites like YouTube any content that has any copy@@ ri@@ ghted content in it , whether or not there &apos;s a judgment of fair use that might be applied to the use of that content .
they live life knowing they live it against the law .
sometimes , we fly the drone in a law@@ n@@ mo@@ wer@@ -type pattern and take pictures of that area , and those pictures can be processed to produce a map of that forest .
and in a way , they are right .
they actually thrive from peer recognition .
take for example the case of lions .
that &apos;s how far the lion can see in all directions until his or her view is obstruc@@ ted by vegetation .
this is how we see a rainforest , in k@@ al@@ ei@@ dos@@ copic color that tells us that there are many species living with one another .
with our system , we &apos;re able to see the carbon stocks of tropical forests in utter detail .
my second question : how do we prepare for climate change in a place like the Amazon rainforest ?
and in a place like Kruger , the soaring elephant densities are a real problem .
Sar@@ ge Salman : all the way from Los Altos Hills , California , Mr. Henry E@@ vans .
and we said , what if we wanted to cover an area spanning around 140 square kilometers ?
and of course , we &apos;re talking about drones , right , a technology that &apos;s not only unpopular in the West but one that has become a very , very unpleasant fact of life for many living in poor countries , especially those engaged in conflict .
those tribal societies , which constitu@@ ted all human societies for most of human history , are far more diverse than are our modern , recent , big societies .
that sinister expression means that if hospital resources are limited , for example if only one donor heart becomes available for transplant , or if a surgeon has time to operate on only a certain number of patients , American hospitals have an explicit policy of giving preference to younger patients over older patients on the grounds that younger patients are considered more valuable to society because they have more years of life ahead of them , even though the younger patients have fewer years of valuable life experience behind them .
another reason is our American emphasis on the virtues of self-@@ reliance and independence , so we instinctively look down on older people who are no longer self-@@ reliant and independent .
most of our current voters and politicians have no personal experience of any of those things , but millions of older Americans do .
I want to see what happens with those words .
we can be in the middle of a meeting , listen to somebody &apos;s presentation , evaluate it , decide whether or not we like it , ask follow-up questions .
we &apos;re going to write it down , and when you get home , pull out those notes and think about them and end up practicing over time .
everything we do is an approximation of sophistication .
so a primate that eats eight hours per day can afford at most 53 billion neurons , but then its body cannot be any bigger than 25 kilos .
it made me so happy .
and this leads to the third element , which is new , and that &apos;s flexibility .
so where does this leave us ?
we &apos;ve met thousands , possibly millions of people , who want the opportunity to invest in social change .
it helps the body develop , makes the hips widen , and thic@@ kens the womb &apos;s lining , preparing the body for menstruation or pregnancy .
the primary function of the endocrine system is to regulate our bodily processes , not control us .
there are other things like genetic differences in populations that may lead to at-risk populations that are at risk of having an adverse drug reaction .
and no , I &apos;m not a meter maid , and I &apos;m not an under@@ taker .
so RO@@ V stands for Re@@ m@@ ote Oper@@ ated Ve@@ hic@@ le , which in our case means our little robot sends live video across that ultra-@@ thin tether back to the computer top@@ side .
we kept prototyping , and eventually , we decided we wanted to go to the cave . we were ready .
( Applause )
I am sure , I am optimistic , that they will make cities better than our most ambitious dreams .
shipping is as crucial to us as it has ever been .
we traveled through five seas , two oceans , nine ports , and I learned a lot about shipping .
( Laughter ) So we have these very multinational , global , mobile crews on ships .
we were no longer allowed on deck .
we know about man &apos;s impact on the ocean in terms of fishing and overfishing , but we don &apos;t really know much about what &apos;s happening underneath the water .
how do you cast mud ?
so how do you map a cave ?
and of course , in those days , there were no antidepressant drugs , and it became very , very popular .
this reason really is that I am a man who , almost 30 years ago , had his life saved by two long courses of electros@@ ho@@ ck therapy .
he asked to meet with the senior staff , and they agreed to meet with him , because he was very well thought of in that place .
they thought this was a temporary change .
and if had been a horror movie , people in the audience would have started saying , &quot; Don &apos;t go in there . don &apos;t go in there . &quot; ( Laughter ) And of course , the crocodile was in the shadows .
the cro@@ c again continues to shake me .
halfway up the bank , a young teenage elephant came in behind her , and he pro@@ pped his trunk underneath her , and he began to shovel her up the bank .
the next day I watched again as the matriarch broke a branch and she would put it in her mouth , and then she would break a second one and drop it on the ground .
you know , he used to go to a rugby match and we would win .
I used to watch a children &apos;s news program at the time , and this was the era of space exploration .
they work like this .
and the pursuit of fame is as widespread and popular now as it ever was , and in our digital age , it &apos;s even easier to achieve .
he argued that the fear of death is natural , but it is not rational .
( Laughter ) NASA &apos;s been expecting to see an interstellar comet pass through the solar system since the 1970s , but until now , we &apos;d never seen anything .
well , the impact energy depends on the square of the velocity times its mass , and the mass depends on how big it is and what it &apos;s made of .
nothing else in our solar system looks like this .
( Applause ) Je@@ did@@ ah Is@@ ler : thanks , Karen .
will future technologies like the Large Sy@@ no@@ p@@ tic Survey Telescope help us detect these things sooner ?
so what is this industrial Internet ?
St. Luke &apos;s Medical Center in Houston , Texas , which has deployed industrial Internet technology to electronically monitor and connect patients , staff and medical equipment , has reduced bed turnaround times by nearly one hour .
the list goes on , and it will grow fast , because industrial data are now growing exponentially .
but think about it : just as a child can easily figure out how to operate an iPad , so a new generation of mobile and intuitive industrial applications will make life easier for workers of all skill levels .
they say that all the grow@@ th-@@ enhancing innovations are behind us .
I would come home and I would see the red light flashing on my answering machine , and instead of being thrilled to hear from my friends , I would think , &quot; What a lot of people that is to have to call back . &quot;
and I also started reck@@ oning with this terrible question : if I &apos;m not the tough person who could have made it through a concentration camp , then who am I ?
I went a few years ago to a conference , and on Friday of the three-@@ day conference , one of the participants took me aside , and she said , &quot; I suffer from depression and I &apos;m a little embarrassed about it , but I &apos;ve been taking this medication , and I just wanted to ask you what you think ? &quot;
but then I discovered something .
they don &apos;t cry like they used to , and they don &apos;t fight like they did .
things keep on changing , the way I dress , the way I feel , the way I act .
I feel more , in fact , I think , because I can feel sadness without n@@ ull@@ ity .
while you hide from it , it grows .
so at D-@@ Re@@ v , we &apos;ve done some other projects , and we looked at three things that we really believe gets technologies to customers , to users , to people who need it .
and most medical devices , we &apos;ve learned , as we &apos;ve dug in , are really designed for Westerners , for wealthier economies .
he &apos;d made a cos@@ mesis .
not only have I tried four times , but the greatest swim@@ mers in the world have been trying since 1950 , and it &apos;s still never been done .
the box jellyfish , the deadliest venom in all of the ocean , is in these waters , and I have come close to dying from them on a previous attempt .
you can &apos;t see the front of your hand , and the people on the boat , Bonnie and my team on the boat -- they just hear the sl@@ apping of the arms , and they know where I am , because there &apos;s no visual at all .
and as you think about that experience , I want you to ask yourself : how might that experience of being a privileged player in a rigged game change the way you think about yourself and regard that other player ?
( Laughter ) And over the course of 15 minutes , we watched through hidden cameras what happened .
&#91; video &#93; RP : are those pretzels a trick ?
( Laughter ) the drivers &apos; tendencies to break the law increased as well .
no one put a curse on my mother &apos;s uterus , and I didn &apos;t get it because my parents are first cousins , which they are .
( Laughter ) And you &apos;re like , &quot; God , can &apos;t I just be a little disabled ? &quot;
( Laughter ) G@@ rowing up , there were only six Arabs in my town , and they were all my family .
( Laughter ) Summer vacations often consisted of my father trying to heal me , so I drank deer &apos;s milk , I had hot cups on my back , I was dun@@ ked in the Dead Sea , and I remember the water burning my eyes and thinking , &quot; It &apos;s working ! it &apos;s working ! &quot;
I was a girl with CP .
my dream was coming true .
and actually , we have current data that does show that there is an actual drift towards complexity over time .
and then what we see in the singularity , that prophe@@ sized by Kurzweil and others -- his idea that technology is accelerating evolution .
and it &apos;s actually a way of playing the game , of playing all the games .
and even if they could have access to the banking infrastructure , they wouldn &apos;t necessarily be considered viable customers , because they &apos;re not wealthy enough to have bank accounts .
( Applause )
( Laughter ) But I thought I needed to lose weight , and when I gained it back , of course I blamed myself .
we would love to think that your brain could tell whether you need to lose weight or not , but it can &apos;t .
we talked to pharmaceutical companies .
so , can I build time machines ?
you can reconstruct that journey , visualize it in many different ways .
but it speaks to a larger vision for a music industry that &apos;s sometimes struggled to find its footing in this digital age , that they begin to see these new technologies not simply as ways of adding bells and whistles to an existing model , but to dream up entirely new ways for people to interact with and experience music .
small actions can make a big difference .
and the WHO has figures that suggest about 1.3 million deaths per year take place due to cross-@@ contamination with need@@ le@@ stick injuries .
what we do is when we apply the Nanopatch to the skin as so -- ( Cli@@ ck ) -- immediately a few things happen .
and as a scientist , I love that and I love science .
right , which , I admit , I do . right ? I &apos;ve talked about it before .
it &apos;s such an extraordinarily artificial color .
I realized this was an elephant that had absolutely nothing to do with a majestic march across the Ser@@ en@@ ge@@ ti .
the label had told me that these pieces were made by the S@@ è@@ v@@ res Man@@ u@@ factory , made of por@@ cel@@ ain in the late 17@@ 50s , and designed by a designer called Jean-@@ Clau@@ de D@@ up@@ less@@ is , actually somebody of extraordinary distinction as I later learned .
it &apos;s all about information , analysis , decision-making and planning .
whatever that means .
audience : sex .
this is not a question of individual concern , this is a matter of family honor , and in particular , men &apos;s honor .
if you are feeling very cold , you come near a fire , it &apos;s so wonderful .
and also , when things go wrong , we try to fix the outside so much , but our control of the outer world is limited , temporary , and often , ill@@ us@@ ory .
a kind of sense of inner freedom as opposite to intense grasping and obsession .
the scientific embar@@ go -- a paper has been submitted to &quot; Nature , &quot; hopefully , it will be accepted .
it &apos;s something that is totally out of the bell curve .
from our brains to our hearts , our lungs , our joints .
and the second is that we aren &apos;t taking what we have learned , and routinely applying it in clinical care .
we have the technology to make the diagnosis .
all three women have something very important in common .
and these genes are activated mainly by estrogen .
but if you ask the question , your doctor will very likely go looking for the answer .

everything has to change .
7,@@ 200 is also a big number .
&quot; honey , come over for dinner . &quot;
with instant feedback , the computer grades exercises .
my colleague Ed Ber@@ t@@ sch@@ inger , who heads up the physics department at MIT , has this to say about instant feedback : he indicated that instant feedback turns teaching moments into learning outcomes .
before that , I &apos;d been a criminal prosecutor , first in the Manhattan district attorney &apos;s office , and then at the United States Department of Justice .
and when I talk to judges around the United States , which I do all the time now , they all say the same thing , which is that we put dangerous people in jail , and we let non-@@ dangerous , nonviolent people out .
so fascinated , in fact , that I started a weekly YouTube series called &quot; G@@ ross Science , &quot; all about the sli@@ my , smelly , creepy underbelly of nature , medicine and technology .
but there &apos;s another layer to why we define stuff as gross .
I think at a certain point , kids really begin to internalize this link between disgusting things and im@@ morality .
what the model told us is that , in a nutshell , each bat knows a few other colony members as her friends , and is just slightly more likely to ro@@ ost in a box with them .
I was greatly influenced by art , and I wanted to incorporate it in everything I did , even my business .
now a lot of people ask me , why is your business eco-friendly ?
so when I started my business , I knew two things : all of my items had to be eco-friendly , and 10 to 20 percent of the profits I made went to local and global charities and environmental organizations .
but a small percentage of those who experience trauma have persistent problems - sometimes vanishing temporarily only to re@@ surface months later .
we don &apos;t completely understand what &apos;s happening in the brain , but one theory is that the stress hormone cortisol may be continuously activating the &quot; fight-@@ f@@ light-@@ freeze &quot; response while reducing overall brain functioning , leading to a number of negative symptoms .
sadness is indicated by the inner corners of the eyebrows being drawn inwards and upwards , dro@@ oping eyes , and a down@@ turned mouth .
&quot; look , &quot; he told us , &quot; my initial advice to you is clearly bad , so my official recommendation is that Tra@@ vis go back on the medication until he can find someone more competent to wean him off . &quot;
I altern@@ ated between cooling my fe@@ ver@@ ish head against the ceramic tiles and trying violently to throw up despite not having eaten anything in days .
my dependence on opioids was entirely predictable given the amount that I was prescribed and the duration for which I was prescribed it .
( Applause ) Six@@ ty-four percent . now , how did we get there ?
it says all the same stuff as all the other ones you &apos;ve seen .
this is the growth rate of CO2 in the atmosphere .
here &apos;s some data from actually just 10 days ago , which shows this year &apos;s minimum of the Arctic Sea ice , and it &apos;s the lowest by far .
cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military , not the cost of medical care .
and we could do that by perfectly sensible things like conservation , and wind power , nuclear power and coal to CO2 capture , which are all things that are ready for giant scale deployment , and work .
and different people will have different places they want it set .
so I &apos;m going to try and describe some of the experiences that we &apos;re looking for through each of the works .
and you immediately see how the un@@ steady nature of the video suggests the presence of an observer and a subjective point of view .
you observe that , over the course of the millennia , Earth is continually bombarded with asteroids up until a point , and that at some point , corresponding roughly to our year , 2000 AD , asteroids that are on a collision course with the Earth that otherwise would have collided mysteriously get def@@ lected or they deton@@ ate before they can hit the Earth .
the machines would rise up against us .
now there will be those who will argue that this could all too easily drift into a form of censorship , albeit self-@@ censorship , but I don &apos;t buy that argument .
the most ar@@ dent of liber@@ t@@ arians might argue that Dono@@ gh@@ ue v. Stevenson should have been thrown out of court and that Stevenson would eventually have gone out of business if he &apos;d continued to sell ginger beer with snails in it .
it is hard to say what shape this inten@@ sification will take , because it largely depends on social and technical innovations , which are by definition difficult to predict .
I don &apos;t have any inherent value .
I mean , I have things at the back of my refrigerator that have been there for years , all right ?
you need , like , an air@@ less environment to prevent the degrading that would happen naturally .
well I &apos;d say , &quot; You &apos;re looking at the wrong problems . &quot;

Cal@@ PE@@ RS is the pension fund for public employees in California , and with assets of 24@@ 4 billion &#91; dollars &#93; , they are the second largest in the U.S .
this is why we are concerned with ESG . &quot;
the one that just really gets under my skin is , &quot; If you want to do something about that , just make money , give the profits to charities . &quot;
it &apos;s not such an ominous thing .
and then I saw William typing a message on his device .
but a lot remains to be done in two years .
but of course I explained to her , &quot; You can &apos;t do that ; it &apos;s not allowed . &quot;
that confidence was based on two pillars .
but you know what , that &apos;s the point of a matching scheme .
imagine what we could do with 40 percent more funding .
this would be a good outcome for energy . and of course , by now , you &apos;re probably saying to yourself , &quot; Sel@@ f , I thought I came to a talk about energy and here &apos;s this guy talking about biology . &quot;
that means that despite corporate training programs , off-@@ sites , assessments , coaching , all of these things , more than half the companies had failed to grow enough great leaders .
I &apos;m going to go off script and make Chris quite nervous here by making this audience participation .
I see one guy there .
CA : Thank you . communicated powerfully . thanks a lot .
one of my most memorable grenade tosses was at my sister &apos;s wedding .
( Laughter ) It was the first time that many in attendance knew I was gay , so in doing my maid of honor duties , in my black dress and heels , I walked around to tables and finally landed on a table of my parents &apos; friends , folks that had known me for years .
for one thing , and this is where I get excited , flight is about to get a lot more personal .
but what if you could fly over it ?
and that gives you redundancy and safety .
are we that far away from a time when lots of people have one of these in their garage and just kind of , go direct to their friend &apos;s house ?
it &apos;s happening across the globe , and one of my favorite examples is from Mexico City , where earlier this year , the Mexico House of Representatives entered into a contract with a software development firm to build an app that legislators would use to track bills .

almost two years ago , I was driving in my car in Germany , and I turned on the radio .
if over 70 percent of a country &apos;s population under the age of 35 is unemployed , of course this has a huge impact on the economy today and even more so in the future .
most of the cost was the commission to the sales@@ men .
it was about falling transaction costs breaking up value chains and therefore allowing dis@@ intermedi@@ ation , or what we call deconstruc@@ tion .
this , I would suggest , perhaps it will take a while , but this will drive a revolution in medicine .
but there &apos;s one thing that doesn &apos;t get much attention .
and so now I &apos;m working on , how can I get these mental images in my mind out to my computer screen faster ?
what happens to matter if you chop it up very fine ?

so what might this look like ?
now , you might have noticed something else about the animals when they were running over the rough terrain .

CA : Ed , one response to this whole debate is this : why should we care about all this surveillance , honestly ?
beyond that , it &apos;s a part of our cultural identity , not just in America , but in Western societies and in democratic societies around the world .
es : Dick Ch@@ eney &apos;s really something else .
CA : so I &apos;d actually like to get some feedback from the audience here , because I know there &apos;s widely differ@@ ing reactions to Edward Snowden .
( Applause ) Tim , good to see you . come up there .
es : absolutely . there &apos;s really no question , the principles that have been the foundation of this project have been the public interest and the principles that under@@ ly the journalistic establishment in the United States and around the world , and I think if the press is now saying , we support this , this is something that needed to happen , that &apos;s a powerful argument , but it &apos;s not the final argument , and I think that &apos;s something that public should decide .
if you could encapsul@@ ate it in a single idea , what is your idea worth spreading right now at this moment ?
and in the astronaut business , we have a saying , which is , there is no problem so bad that you can &apos;t make it worse .
how do you get around it , though ?
the comeback on that is a couple of things : one , that he certainly believes that as a contractor , the avenues that would have been available to him as an employee weren &apos;t available , two , there &apos;s a track record of other whistleblowers , like &#91; Thomas Andre@@ ws Drake &#93; being treated pretty harshly , by some views , and thirdly , what he was taking on was not one specific flaw that he &apos;d discovered , but programs that had been approved by all three branches of government .
I think there &apos;s also an amazing arrogance to the idea that he knows better than the fra@@ mers of the Constitution in how the government should be designed and work for separation of powers and the fact that the executive and the legislative branch have to work together and they have checks and balances on each other , and then the judicial branch , which over@@ sees the entire process .
but it &apos;s also used by people who are working against us and our allies .
they think of it as a momentous invention of humanity , kind of on a par with the Gu@@ tenberg press , for example .
what we don &apos;t need to be transparent about , because it &apos;s bad for the U.S. , it &apos;s bad for all those other countries that we work with and that we help provide information that helps them secure themselves and their people , it &apos;s bad to expose operations and capabilities in a way that allows the people that we &apos;re all working against , the generally recognized bad guys , to counter those .
and so it &apos;s being picked up by people as a marketing advantage , and it &apos;s being marketed that way by several countries , including some of our allied countries , where they are saying , &quot; Hey , you can &apos;t trust the U.S. , but you can trust our telecom company , because we &apos;re safe . &quot;
they &apos;re approved by the attorney general and constitu@@ tionally based .
CA : much has been made of the fact that a lot of the information that you &apos;ve obtained through these programs is essentially metadata .
you &apos;re probably aware that there have been a sp@@ ate of those directed against the U.S. financial sector since 2012 .
or do you think that is not a legitimate reaction , that it &apos;s only because it &apos;s now come out publicly , that they really knew exactly what you were doing with the powers they had granted you ?
I &apos;ll def@@ er to them .
LP : yeah , absolutely .

those gravitational waves in the structure of space are totally invisible for all practical purposes .
this is a theory , an idea , that has been around for a while , and we never thought we we &apos;d really see it .
and so we picked those two things , and everything the foundation does is focused there .
you should look at , what was your goal ?
we can do better than venture capital , I think , including big hits like this .
BG : no , I &apos;m kidding . MG : Oh , you mean , the employees didn &apos;t go away .
and part of the reason I &apos;m so optimistic is because I do think philanthropy is going to grow and take some of these things government &apos;s not just good at working on and discovering and shine some light in the right direction .
( Applause )
and he said to me on that very day , he said that New York was projected to grow from eight to nine million people .
and we can see how nature &apos;s ingenious devices work , and perhaps we can even imitate them .
and by tracking markers on an insect &apos;s wings , we can visualize the air flow that they produce .
we think we know most of the animal kingdom , but there may be millions of tiny species waiting to be discovered .
tiny chemical machines of the future can one day , perhaps , repair DNA .
and you will fall , and you will die . dangerous .
you go to the future back , back , back , back , like that .
the only rule is , we have not to have any idea about the next story .
prosthe@@ tists still use conventional processes like molding and casting to create single-@@ material prosthetic so@@ ckets .
she understands everything , but the communication is just very difficult because when you look at the picture , the part of your brain where those communication centers are are on the left side of your head , which is where the bullet passed through .
everybody , including Gabby , talked you into going back , and you did end up taking .
you &apos;ve got to find a replacement for me . &quot;
I have to share this video of your most recent adventure .
P@@ 2 : and she &apos;s behind you 100 percent no matter what happens here .
there was no physical evidence against Brendan at all .
and treating juveniles as though they &apos;re adults in interro@@ gations is a problem , because literally hundreds of psychological and neuroscienti@@ fic studies tell us that juveniles do not think like adults , they do not behave like adults , and they &apos;re not built like adults .
LM : so he sums it up pretty beautifully there : &quot; they got into my head . &quot;
parents experience more stress than non-@@ parents .
we are all the custo@@ dians of their self-esteem .
the DBC will also be valuable when placed in strategic areas around the world , for rapid response to disease outbreaks .
but I &apos;ll tell you what is easy : avoiding CO2 emissions to begin with .
so knowing that direct air capture is one front in our fight against climate change , imagine that we could invest 20 percent , 20 billion dollars .
our dependence on liquid fuels makes these emissions really difficult to avoid .
we &apos;ll see something like that , a slightly blurry picture of the Earth , because we &apos;re a fairly small telescope out at the orbit of Mars .
that will change everything when we see that .
it limited the number of fonts you could get on your type@@ setting system at any one time .
what had started as a technical exercise became an aesthetic exercise , really .
but I stayed because I realized I was witnessing what &apos;s so rare to glimpse , that difference between success and mastery .
painter Paul C@@ é@@ zanne so often thought his works were incomplete that he would deliberately leave them aside with the intention of picking them back up again , but at the end of his life , the result was that he had only signed 10 percent of his paintings .
in the ocean , you can extract the fuel for about one thousandth of a cent per kilowatt@@ -hour , so that &apos;s very , very cheap .
now , the particle speed is a measure of the temperature .
the liquid metal absorbs all the neutrons and no neutrons hit the wall , and therefore there &apos;s no damage to the machine .
so what the idea is is to use the idea of an impact .
so it &apos;s going to be a big machine , about three meters in diameter , liquid lead spinning around , big vortex in the center , put the plasma on the top and on the bottom , pi@@ ston hits on the side , bang ! , it com@@ presses it , and it will make some energy , and the neutron will come out in the liquid metal , going to go in a steam engine and make the turbine , and some of the steam will go back to fire the pi@@ ston .
well , you see self-organizing patterns that spontaneously occur in this board game .
we got a small seed grant , just to see if folks would be willing to work with us on this ; we &apos;re very excited about the future possibilities for that .
these are ways of doing self-organization -- of doing entrepreneurship -- that are gentle , that are egalitarian .
so this takes that ban@@ ding idea , takes that ban@@ ding idea , it &apos;s highly visible , provides a highly disruptive profile , and is intended to prevent the shark from considering that you would be ordinary food , and potentially even create confusion for the shark .
second iteration is the cryptic wetsuit , or the one which attempts to hide the wear@@ er in the water column .
and the satellite imagery we have of it today is old .
we &apos;ve used modern production techniques so we can build large numbers of them , I think for the first time .
some of the atomic motion in the hot object is transferred to the surroundings , and it cools down .
but so far , none of these has provided as much physical stability for data storage and transmission .
say , a red cross volunteer going into an earthquake zone .
but autism is not a single condition .
has that number been increasing dramatically over time ?
as a result of that , more individuals were diagnosed and got access to the resources they needed .
the next question everyone wonders is , what caused autism ?
pretty accurate , isn &apos;t it ?
don &apos;t do that .
HW : right , right .
( Laughter ) DK : so we actually have technologies that prevent people from trying to use this device to monitor somebody without their consent .
( beeps ) That &apos;s the entire finish of the race .
so I consulted biomechanics experts to find out how much slower it is to run on cin@@ ders than synthetic tracks , and their consensus that it &apos;s one and a half percent slower .
today , one in 10 men in the NBA is at least seven feet tall , but a seven-@@ foot-@@ tall man is incredibly rare in the general population -- so rare that if you know an American man between the ages of 20 and 40 who is at least seven feet tall , there &apos;s a 17 percent chance he &apos;s in the NBA right now .
my arm span is exactly equal to my height .
we think of Kenyans as being great marath@@ on@@ ers .
Kenyans think of the Kal@@ en@@ jin tribe as being great marath@@ on@@ ers .
to put Kal@@ en@@ jin running success in perspective , consider that 17 American men in history have run faster than two hours and 10 minutes in the marathon .
( Laughter ) With a sweat@@ shirt there tied around his waist .
we &apos;d have to run our equipment from petrol power generators .
we set about replacing traditional hospital equipment , which is bulky , expensive and fragile , with smartphone apps and hardware that make it possible to test anyone in any language and of any age .
and there &apos;s lots of different ways to kick the system .
the question you have to ask is whether a model tells you more information than you would have had otherwise .
how do air pollution and climate coexist ?
and so the idea that there are questions that I &apos;ve never seen that my people are going to answer , and some of these characters have been with me for ages , some of them don &apos;t even have names , I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen .
okay , next question . ( Applause ) What are your top five favorite songs right now ?
you know what I &apos;m saying ?
I don &apos;t care if the present is the new future .
AB : 93 squared .
volunteer : 0 , 7 , 9 , 0 , 4 , 4 .
audience : 1959 .
Mt : in other words , if we do not yet have the technological solutions , would illusions serve the same purpose ?
we bled , we died , and we killed to stop that organization from the violence that they were putting largely against the Iraqi people .
and he says , &quot; They &apos;re their personnel records . &quot;
we &apos;re not alone , though .
you can think of my router sort of like a security guard , compulsively logging all the network packets as they entered and left the smart home .
and this was just , like , really hard to remember first thing in the morning , before you have had your caffeine .
and I &apos;ve had people send in what are clearly homework questions they &apos;re trying to get me to do for them .
so I decided to try to figure this out myself .
Google has to reveal how much they spend , in general , and that lets you put some caps on how many data centers could they be building , because a big data center costs a certain amount of money .
so what I did , I went through all of this information , spent a day or two researching .
this is the song from the TED Talks online .
Ma : I &apos;m going to do so in a way that tells a story .
control fraud is what happens when the people who control , typically a CEO , a seemingly legitimate entity , use it as a weapon to de@@ fraud .
so this was an incredibly early warning , 2000 .
and our exam@@ iners said , they are making loans without even checking what the borro@@ wer &apos;s income is .
we had incredibly early warnings of it , and it was absolutely unambiguous that no honest lender would make loans in this fashion .
by 2006 , 40 percent of all the loans made that year , all the home loans made that year , were liar &apos;s loans , 40 percent .
it is the sil@@ liest story you can conceive of , and so they go and they prosecute the hair@@ dress@@ ers , and they leave the bank@@ sters alone entirely .
this is where most folks stand before taking their lives .
after about an hour of speaking with Jason , he asked us if we knew the story of Pandora &apos;s box .
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago , and I received an email from a lady that I &apos;d like to read you her letter .
Kevin decided on his own that day to come back over that rail and give life another chance .
this is what suicide does .
in my career , I &apos;ve responded to and been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge .
I said , &quot; Why do you have treat us like cattle ?
Bob believes in heart counts , and it &apos;s much more difficult to simply reduce the heart count .
you notice some details very , very , very accurately and other things drop out .
it &apos;s hormon@@ ally supported .
half a second later , I heard du@@ t-@@ du@@ t-@@ du@@ t-@@ du@@ t-@@ duh .
it was the first round , the first burst of an hour-@@ long fire@@ fight .
just think about the math on that .
&quot; Ma &apos;am , I miss almost all of it . &quot;
he &apos;s not a psychopath .
it didn &apos;t bother him .
the worst thing that happened to him in Afghanistan was one of his men was hit in the head with a bullet in the helmet , knocked him over .
we do need new ways of telling history , and this year , for example , we started a new online project that is called 196@@ 8@@ Dig@@ it@@ al@@ .com , and that is an online documentary series that gives you an impression of that year , 1968 , a year marked by global social change that , in many ways , created the world as we know it now .
ordinary people matter .
and now I &apos;m old with regret , wish@@ in &apos; I could hold you and just forget .
this is India and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in India .
and the beauty of this is that you don &apos;t need to form bri@@ quettes -- it comes ready made .
I mean the world where women spend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat .
and we need to think about how we can do that effectively .
Thank you .
the other thing is you have to do things with a long time frame , as , you know , you can &apos;t expect to get something done in a year or two years ; you have to be looking five or 10 years ahead .
anything below eight percent sweetness is not sweet enough ; anything above 12 percent sweetness is too sweet .
Howard loves the Y@@ id@@ dish expression &quot; To a worm in hor@@ ser@@ a@@ dish , the world is hor@@ ser@@ a@@ dish . &quot;
when we talked about &quot; authentic tomato sauce &quot; in the 1970s , we talked about Italian tomato sauce , we talked about the earliest Rag@@ ù@@ s , which had no visible solids , right ?
you can track it back to the factory . once you can track it back to the factory , you can look at the manufacturing processes that were used to make it , and if it &apos;s virtuous , you can label it that way . or if it &apos;s not so virtuous , you can go into -- today , go into any store , put your scanner on a palm onto a barcode , which will take you to a website .
some people get a number stuck in their head , you may recognize a certain name or a tune , some people get nothing , but four in the morning was in me now , but mildly , like a gro@@ in injury .
I always assumed it would just go away on its own eventually , and I never talked about it with anybody , but it did not , and I totally did .
this is a college student &apos;s suggestion for what a &quot; four in the morning &quot; gang sign should look like .
at one point , it went , &quot; Guys and Dol@@ ls : the M@@ usi@@ cal , &quot; &quot; Last T@@ an@@ go in Paris , &quot; &quot; Di@@ ary of a W@@ imp@@ y Kid , &quot; &quot; Por@@ n Star : legend of Ron Jeremy . &quot;
she was already smoking hot , she was super dor@@ ky , and we had a Dec@@ emb@@ er-@@ May romance , meaning we started dating in December , and by May , she had graduated and became my one that got away .
as a scientist , and also as a human being , I &apos;ve been trying to make myself susceptible to wonder .
they spend the vast majority of their lifetime , up to two years , in this lar@@ val form .
but what &apos;s the point to being so conspic@@ uous ?
it took many millions of years before these bright lights evolved into a smart communication tool that could be used not just to ward off potential predators but to bring in potential mates .
now , I &apos;m not going to share them with you , but this is the place that most people have looked for pheromones .
if you &apos;re a mammal , the most dangerous time in life is the first few hours after birth .
as far back as we can go , we &apos;ve seen an increase in the amount of food we &apos;ve been able to harvest from our oceans .
when these countries step in and they put in sustainable fisheries management policies , the fisheries , which are always crashing , it seems , are starting to come back .
it &apos;s already a big part of our diet , but it can be a bigger part of our diet , which is a good thing , because we know that it &apos;s healthy for us .
let &apos;s take them all , and let &apos;s pull them back a little bit by those that are known to have severe symptoms , where the parents , the child , those around them would know that they &apos;d gotten sick , and let &apos;s go ahead and then frame them again by those parts of the genes where we know that there is a particular alter@@ ation that is known to be highly penetr@@ ant to cause that disease .
the folds are apart when we &apos;re breathing , but when we speak , they slam shut .
in January of this year , I went to Myanmar to interview political prisoners , and I was surprised to find them less bitter than I &apos;d anticipated .
and that &apos;s what they did .
but if seeking meaning matters more than finding meaning , the question is not whether I &apos;d be happier for having been bullied , but whether assigning meaning to those experiences has made me a better father .
I know many heterosex@@ u@@ als who have equally happy marriages and families , but gay marriage is so breath@@ ta@@ kingly fresh , and gay families so exhilar@@ atingly new , and I found meaning in that surprise .
one government biologist , he explained this war on animals like the bear by saying that they no longer had a place in our advancing civilization , and so we were just clearing them out of the way .
so we &apos;ve gone hands-on and we can &apos;t ever take our hands off , and that &apos;s a hell of a lot of work .
normally , you wouldn &apos;t be able to see him , but the augmented reality system lets you know .
( Applause )
sometimes we know who they are , sometimes we don &apos;t , but there is that feeling , the shared experience , the shared bond where we know that that experience and that chapter of our life , while it might be closed , it &apos;s still not over .
so , when things aren &apos;t working out , I tend to take a step back , apply my business toolkit to figure out why , and to fix it .
now , I can &apos;t promise you &apos;re going to end up with house plants .
and this can be done for any expression .
young people can stay on a parent &apos;s plan until they turn 26 .
and one of the tools we plan to release is called Re@@ ality Def@@ ender , which is a web-@@ browser plug-in that can flag potentially fake content automatically , right in the browser .
right now , if I stand like this , I have no clue that there &apos;s this whole side of the room .
( Laughter ) I am a fun kid , and she &apos;s the one missing out .
( Laughter ) ( Audience ) You do , you do !
I &apos;m a social psychologist , which basically means I &apos;m a professional people wat@@ cher .
well , to investigate this question , we conducted a simple experiment .
we told participants in our experiment about a new surgical procedure , and we randomly assigned them to one of two conditions .
but then we added a twist : we told participants in the first group , &quot; You know , you could think of this as a 30 % failure rate . &quot;
so , think about the economy .
let &apos;s say you get to an unfamiliar place and you see this .
and so I wanted to create an image of a silent catastrophe .
and what I want to do is not show a realistic scene .
what have I done to offend the gods that they would abandon me so ?
well they say , write what you know .
occasionally on a really important ship , they &apos;d get a member of the royal family to come , Duke of Edinburgh , Princess Anne or somebody .
I &apos;m not very happy with her .
and I wave my flag even more vigorously .
and so here I am at TED , I suppose to tell that story , and I think it &apos;s appropriate to say the obvious that there &apos;s a symbiotic and intrinsic link between storytelling and community , between community and art , between community and science and technology , between community and economics .
it &apos;s a puzzle , and I &apos;ve discussed it with dozens of experts from different disciplines over the past three decades .
a 2010 study showed that an octopus in captivity can recognize different humans .
communication across space -- that &apos;s a fourth barrier .
some say a summer civilization did colonize the galaxy and seeded Earth with life ...
there could be a trillion planets in the galaxy .
Thank you very much .
the guy says , &quot; You &apos;re a rabbi , how can you not believe in God ? &quot;
it be@@ devils our decision-making in important ways .
it &apos;s about the Garden of Eden and the Fall and the Bi@@ blical story of the Fall , in which sex as we know it and death and guilt come into the world at the same time .
and out@@ worn usages like &quot; smack &quot; for &quot; kiss &quot; or &quot; hit &quot; can help us see how our un@@ acknowledged assumptions can make us believe we are bad , either because sex is sin@@ ful or because we tolerate so much sexism .
( Applause )
they ain &apos;t got that power .
so as these movements continue on , and as freedom struggles around the world continue on , let &apos;s remember that not only are they interconnected , but they must support and enhance each other for us to be truly victorious .
and these images , there are lots of them out there , they are what we call inspiration porn .
the lies we tell ourselves are lakes , over@@ flowing their banks , flooding our speech with waters , caus@@ tic and rank .
more than your killer Katrina D@@ anz@@ i@@ ger .
it &apos;s time we strike a new note .
Bar@@ nab@@ y Jack could have easily turned into a career criminal or James Bond villain with his knowledge , but he chose to show the world his research instead .
she was pretty and she could roller@@ blade , but being a hacker , that made her powerful .
this is what Khal@@ il did .
frustrated with the exchange , he took to use his own discovery to post on Mark Zuckerberg &apos;s wall .
since then , they &apos;ve gone after many targets .
when we round every corner and eliminate every sharp object , every po@@ key bit in the world , then the first time that kids come in contact with anything sharp , or not made out of round plastic , they &apos;ll hurt themselves with it .
there is a world of interesting things inside your dishwasher .
now this cloud is an inherent part of research , an inherent part of our craft , because the cloud stands guard at the boundary .
so my vision is that , just like every scientist knows the word &quot; atom , &quot; that matter is made out of atoms , every scientist would know the words like &quot; the cloud , &quot; saying &quot; Yes , and , &quot; and science will become much more creative , make many , many more unexpected discoveries for the benefit of us all , and would also be much more playful .
and I won &apos;t name names , but you know who you are .
we are not a language academy .
I do not listen to my own likes and dis@@ likes about the English language .
neither is better than the other , nor are they equally good .
imagine a world in which every choice you face is an easy choice , that is , there &apos;s always a best alternative .
but as soon as I get to a place of real quiet , I realize that it &apos;s only by going there that I &apos;ll have anything fresh or creative or joyful to share with my wife or bosses or friends .
and in an age of distraction , nothing is so luxurious as paying attention .
and in an age of constant movement , nothing is so urgent as sitting still .
and architecture is a mirror of those changes .
it looks like an immense glider , landing on the ground .
both those two buildings flir@@ t with light .
you see , while the Industrial Revolution did a great deal to improve humanity , it eradicated the very skill that my grandfather loved , and it atro@@ phi@@ ed craftsmanship as we know it .
let &apos;s move on to supply chain and the risk there .
I mean , with all different races and cultures of people , how do you boil it down to one thing ?
but more importantly , we want to remind people in Charleston , South Carolina , of the black bodies , because when you go to Charleston today , the Con@@ feder@@ acy is celebrated , probably more than any other city , and you don &apos;t have a sense of blackness at all .
and then the pattern was changed : triangle , square .
so we used a service called Amazon Mechanical Turk , and this is a service where you can post a small job online that takes a minute , a few minutes , an hour , and pay people , a penny , ten cents , a few dollars , to do a task for you , and then you pay them through Amazon@@ .com .
all right , so now we had 5,000 passwords , and so we had much more detailed information .
so we tested password meters that were different sizes , shapes , colors , different words next to them , and we even tested one that was a dancing bun@@ ny .
( Laughter ) Most of the password meters were actually effective , and the dancing bun@@ ny was very effective too , but the password meters that were the most effective were the ones that made you work harder before they gave you that thumbs up and said you were doing a good job , and in fact we found that most of the password meters on the Internet today are too soft .
( Laughter ) And this quil@@ t has the 1,000 most frequent passwords stolen from the Rock@@ You website .
but then , something extraordinary happened : the Scientific and Industrial R@@ evolu@@ tions .
I believe it is .
well ...
over time , smoke also damages nerve-@@ endings in the nose , causing loss of smell .
so , if even scientists themselves have to make a leap of faith outside their own fields , then why do they accept the claims of other scientists ?
so an important example of this comes from the Copernican model , which ultimately replaced the Ptole@@ ma@@ ic system .
and they asked the question , what set of variables put into a model will reproduce what we actually see in real life ?
and who judges ?
of course , these people don &apos;t really look like scientists , because they &apos;re much too happy .
over time , the two merged to give us the English we know today , though the divide between lords and peasants can still be felt in synon@@ ym pairs such as cow and beef .
this third one is a rat@@ che@@ t-like interaction , so let me turn it up .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s really happening that much anymore .
this is &quot; G.@@ I.@@ R. &quot; from Texas , &quot; R.@@ I.@@ K. &quot; I don &apos;t know why it &apos;s these three-@@ letter names today , Los Angeles .
or , I can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet .
or to make that a bit larger , what would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously and consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound ?
by 20 hours , the pieces started to come together very slowly - ( Laughter ) - and I was pretty sure I was going down the wrong path at this point , but I wasn &apos;t going to give up .
the last piece of the puzzle is understanding how that code controls your battery .
all of this can be done in a matter of hours , whereas the same process would have taken months in the past .
( Laughter ) And that - ( Applause ) - In the depths of a very severe economic recession , I think that there &apos;s a really important lesson there , that if you can remember your international obligations whilst you are trying to rebuild your own economy , that &apos;s really something .
this is not what it &apos;s all about .
countries like China and Russia and India , which is down in the same part of the index , well , in some ways , it &apos;s not surprising .
do I want to come from a country where the government , in my name , is doing things like that ?
Thank you .
scrap dealers recover copper , aluminum , steel , glass , plastic and printed circuit boards .
( Applause ) My AI talk , however , went off brilliantly .
but what &apos;s more serious than the loss of jobs is the loss of meaning , because the work ethic in the Industrial Age has brainwashed us into thinking that work is the reason we exist , that work defined the meaning of our lives .
she found that facing death , nobody regretted that they didn &apos;t work hard enough in this life .
( Applause ) So I can be back at TED again to share with you that I have changed my ways .
( Applause )
so often they &apos;re rational and useful , but sometimes they &apos;re irrational , they give the wrong answers , and other times they lead to pla@@ in@@ ly immoral consequences .
well - ( Applause ) - I am the grandson of immigrants from Japan who went to America , boldly going to a strange new world , seeking new opportunities .
I was four years old when Pearl Harbor was bombed on December 7 , 1941 by Japan , and overnight , the world was plunged into a world war .
and Facebook transmitting the photos , messages and stories of over 1.@@ 23 billion people .
so step one ...
we now have a very clear image of the fingerprint and the police can run it through the database .
I believe this is also a new era for criminal profiling .
there &apos;s a Jewish saying that I love .
soldiers have forced her to watch as her husband was tortured and killed .
so here &apos;s another tale of passion , and this is a sad one .
in a matter of five or six years , they have a forest , the soil is enriched , and the village is saved .
I can promise you that women working together -- linked , informed and educated -- can bring peace and prosperity to this for@@ sa@@ ken planet .
so when it costs millions of dollars to do something substantial , what you would do is you &apos;d get an MBA who would write a plan and get the money from V.@@ C.@@ s or big companies , and then you &apos;d hire the designers and the engineers , and they &apos;d build the thing .
so at the Media Lab , we don &apos;t just do hardware .
we do all kinds of things .
I goo@@ gle desperately , and thankfully that day I find out that Maria was not the victim , though sadly , another Afghan prosecutor was gun@@ ned down on his way to work .
I &apos;m probably much less famous than George , so when he called it the Negroponte switch , it stuck , but the idea of things that came in the ground would go in the air and stuff in the air would go into the ground has played itself out .
okay . read it . ( Laughter ) &#91; &quot; Nicholas Negroponte , director of the MIT Media Lab , predicts that we &apos;ll soon buy books and newspapers straight over the Internet . uh , sure . &quot; - Cli@@ ff@@ ord St@@ oll , News@@ week , 1995 &#93; You must admit that gives you , at least it gives me pleasure when somebody says how dead wrong you are .
so these are the various places it happened .
now , because of this , people have now more and more problems that they are not choosing anything .
( Laughter ) I looked at this woman in shock .
now , we delivered the conference in such a way .
and we wanted to take it to the next level , to give people the tools to take action , to take care of it .
and let &apos;s look here in the port of Vancouver .
there are no truly easy problems with consciousness .
so I think we &apos;re at a kind of impas@@ se here .
well I say , more power to him .
in the time remaining , I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think may have some promise .
well , on the pan@@ psych@@ ist view , you can leave the equations of physics as they are , but you can take them to be describing the flux of consciousness .
it &apos;s there right at its heart .
the first time I stood in the operating room and watched a real surgery , I had no idea what to expect .
because what &apos;s the difference ?
that first day in the operating room I never expected to find myself on the other end of a tro@@ car .
allow yourself to be fascinated , because there are so many lives to save .
I would take things like high@@ lighter pen , mix it with water , pump it through plastic tu@@ bing , creating these glowing circulatory systems for people to walk through and enjoy .
many of these pieces are later on shown in museums , bi@@ enni@@ als , tri@@ ennial exhibitions around the world .
( Applause ) Ne@@ ed@@ less to say , we got the banking license .
she mortg@@ aged her gold and took the loan .
one day I asked Kerabai , &quot; How did you end up singing ? &quot;
I was really surprised to see an untouchable , coming from the village , having a big cut@@ out at the entrance of the village .
it doesn &apos;t like it dry .
as such , it has been mathematically modeled , algorithmically analyzed .
( Laughter ) Okay .
to open up this thing and show how it works and why it works and what it is .
and she &apos;s being eaten ; there &apos;s a shark .
I mean , look inside yourself and figure out what is inside you .
&quot; lost &quot; ! I had no idea !
this is something online ; six years ago , they did this .
the stuff that I was lucky and begging for to get when I was a kid is now ubiquitous .
universities are expensive ; we all know it .
every week , when they go into the classroom , they find the lecture notes of the week , the reading assignment , the homework assignment , and the discussion question , which is the core of our studies .
when adults are worried about math , the children around them start worrying , too .
but then I changed how I studied .
but for that change to happen , we need more researchers creating animations , and toward that end , I brought together a team of biologists , anim@@ ators and programmers to create a new , free , open-source software - we call it Mo@@ le@@ cular F@@ lip@@ book - that &apos;s created just for biologists just to create molecular animations .
in 1989 , more than 90,000 employees worked for the Stasi .
the net of spies was really broad .
if you have the occasion , do visit the former Stasi prison in Berlin and attend a guided tour with a former political prisoner who will explain to you how this worked .
the consequence was that despite all the information , the regime couldn &apos;t analyze its real problems , and therefore it couldn &apos;t solve them .
H@@ K : Oh , that &apos;s a difficult question , but if you ask me , and if I answer honestly , I would give him the asylum , because I think it was really brave what he did , and he destroyed his whole life and his family and everything .
it &apos;s clunky , but you can get away with it , because over time I &apos;ve developed this loop@@ hole method of using speech where right at the last minute you change the thing and you trick your brain .
singing for me is sweet relief .
I was the first non-@@ family investor in Amazon@@ .com .
but I am actually pretty good at a couple of things .
I see pitchforks , as in angry mobs with pitchforks , because while people like us plutocrats are living beyond the dreams of av@@ ar@@ ice , the other 99 percent of our fellow citizens are falling farther and farther behind .
it &apos;s just that that &apos;s all that those entrepreneurs &apos; customers can afford .
balancing the power of capitalists like me and workers isn &apos;t bad for capitalism .
however , the conversation becomes a little bit more complex when the more difficult questions need to be asked .
because I remember , being the front-@@ desk specialist , and when I went to the office of equity to start working , I was like , &quot; Is that why they asked us to ask that question ? &quot;
now I know that data that we have at the front desk translates into research that eliminates disparities and finds cures .
( Applause )
&quot; about two . &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; Okay , so you are telling me that my chances go from a 0.@@ 1-@@ percent chance to a 0.@@ 2-@@ percent chance . &quot;
audience : show me the data !
we &apos;re seen as the organization that is the bucket for failed social policy .
second , we added verbal de-@@ escal@@ ation skills into the training continuum and made it part of the use of force continuum .
let me be clear on what &apos;s going on here , though .
I was more concerned with touching the screen on my Apple than actually feeding him one .
perhaps it &apos;s never been more important at any time in our lifetimes .
catalog all the skills you had to deploy , how to negotiate , how to advocate , how to frame issues , how to navigate diversity in conflict , all those skills that enabled you to bring folks on board and to overcome resistance .
I invite you to literally share the narratives that you create on our Facebook page for Citiz@@ en University .
I want you to think about both sides of that .
we re@@ vel in the fact that we have this wonderful free speech .
well , that chance encounter inspired my imagination , and I created the Lunch Lady graphic novel series , a series of comics about a lunch lady who uses her fish stick n@@ un@@ chuc@@ ks to fight off evil cyborg substitu@@ tes , a school bus monster , and mutant ma@@ th@@ le@@ tes , and the end of every book , they get the bad guy with their hair@@ net , and they proclaim , &quot; Justice is served ! &quot;
and coast to coast , all of the lunch ladies told me the same thing : &quot; Thank you for making a superhero in our li@@ k@@ eness . &quot;
there are always remnants of the perished ones that are more durable than their fragile bodies and our selective and fading memory of them .
( music ) Ladies and gentlemen , we give you with pleasure the Sou@@ l Re@@ bel horn .
everybody in the building say , &quot; Rock it , don &apos;t stop it . &quot;
the first one is the R@@ ci@@ f Pla@@ za , which sits actually right on top of the river , which you can see here in dotted lines .
we devise agr@@ onomic algorithms which tell us how much rainfall a crop needs and when .
lab rats pluck themselves too .
eventually , Bo@@ on@@ lu@@ a wound up at an elephant facility , and the keepers really decided to take him under their wing , and they figured out what he liked , which , it turned out , was mint Men@@ tos and R@@ hin@@ o@@ ceros beetles and eggs .
he was extremely happy to be with this rabbit .
I don &apos;t think that we can not anthropomorphi@@ ze .
and even antidepressants were first tested in rabbits .
they want to know how often your dog gets outside .
and it &apos;s now not just the nuclear threat ; in our interconnected world , network break@@ downs can cascade globally ; air travel can spread pandemics worldwide within days ; and social media can spread panic and rumor literally at the speed of light .
but scientists should surely be precau@@ tionary about experiments that generate conditions without precedent in the natural world .
so in 17@@ 81 , an English composer , technologist and astronomer called William Her@@ sch@@ el noticed an object on the sky that didn &apos;t quite move the way the rest of the stars did .
now , distance and changes in our universe - distance equ@@ ates to time , as well as changes on the sky .
he drifted away , and today I don &apos;t know where to find him .
science is best when everyone is generating lots of exciting data .
and there are hundreds of cell types that use these genes in different combinations .
and this lets me introduce a very important idea about design : designers are the biggest synthe@@ sizers in the world .
but it ranged from such items as a complete de-@@ mining equipment to these kind of water-@@ steri@@ lizing straws , so it was really wide-@@ ranging .
and the truth is that there are very different kinds of luxury , and there &apos;s luxury that is relative for people that don &apos;t have that much .
but that &apos;s because of the kind of strangeness of the market itself .
many of you might know that the Pot@@ ato Chi@@ p C@@ hair by Charles and Ray Eames comes exactly from that kind of instance : fiber@@ glass was available for civilian use all of a sudden .
freedom : I don &apos;t have to prove anything anymore .
I keep telling my super@@ ego to back off and let me enjoy what I still have .
she has been in a wheelchair for six years after a terrible car accident .
the other day , one of my coworkers asked me if I could save that file as a PDF , and I said , &quot; Well , of course , &quot; and he said , &quot; Awesome . &quot;
ladies and gentlemen , here are 10 things that are truly awesome .
Woo@@ d@@ stock , 1969 : rolling Stone Magazine said this changed the history of rock and roll .
maybe you &apos;re a scientific atheist or an un@@ scientific atheist , and you don &apos;t believe in God , and you &apos;re not happy with it .
so we have these two extremes now .
honey , gar@@ lic , cu@@ min , ac@@ ac@@ ia leaves , ce@@ dar oil .
so recently , some white guys and some black women swapped Twitter avatars , or pictures online .
I &apos;m not talking about the kind of colorful debates that I think are healthy for our democracy .
( Laughter ) Up until our mother asked him to leave and not come back , Bageye had been a terrifying o@@ g@@ re .
they determined that they would send me to a private school , but my father worked at V@@ au@@ x@@ hall Motors .
I was so fascinated that I decided to learn this methodology by joining his team as a volunteer .
but what if we tried ?
it &apos;s a term many of you are familiar with .
and she says back , &quot; I &apos;m going to find out who or what is throwing these children in the water . &quot;
part of the reason that we have this con@@ und@@ rum is because there are not nearly enough upstreamists in the healthcare system .
medical schools , nursing schools , all sorts of health professional education programs can help by training the next generation of upstreamists .
we need many more of them in the healthcare system if we &apos;re truly going to have it be effective , to move from a sick@@ care system to a healthcare system .
broccoli ! it &apos;s a head of broccoli .
so I was the first subject .
your face metamor@@ phos@@ ed .
we might need to get a little hurt , just not too hurt .
in 1985 , we started to tour all over the world a little bit , and I started my company , called ST@@ RE@@ B E@@ X@@ T@@ RE@@ M@@ E AC@@ T@@ I@@ O@@ N .
I came across this quote by Wil@@ bur : &quot; if you are looking for perfect safety , you will do well to sit on a fence and watch the birds ; but if you really wish to learn , you must mount a machine and become acqua@@ inted with its tricks by actual trial . &quot;
and so what our nickname ended up becoming , and what ended up sticking , was the L@@ ow@@ line , so the L@@ ow@@ line was born .
so what we &apos;re proposing is really something that will add one football field of green space underneath this neighborhood , but more importantly will introduce a really community-@@ driven focus in a rapidly gentri@@ fying area .
he &apos;s also a pro@@ digi@@ ous art collector , beginning as an intern in Budapest by collecting 16@@ th- and 17@@ th-century Dutch art and Hungarian painting , and when he came to this country moving on to Spanish colonial art , Russian icons and finally Mayan ceramics .
the circulation in our body distributes fresh blood , which feeds , nur@@ tures and supports us , and brings the used blood back to be renewed .
I don &apos;t know of any .
we are floating here on this floating hotel , on one of the largest rivers on Earth , the Negro River .
like endocr@@ inal glands and hormones , there are those gases which I told you about before , that are formed and released into the atmosphere , like hormones , which help in the formation of rain .
it &apos;s a mighty river that irri@@ gates South America , among other things .
if we could establish forests in those other areas , we can reverse climate change , including global warming .
having closed this quick introduction , we see the reality that we have out here , which is drought , this climate change , things that we already knew .
I took the painting and gifted new , contemporary meaning talking about issues which are surrounding me in Russia , capturing people who are non-@@ models but have an interesting story .
and so the first thing that you see in my center in the spring@@ time is water that greets you -- water is life and water of human possibility -- and it sets an attitude and expectation about how you feel about people before you ever give them a speech .
I said , &quot; Well , I got in my car and I went out to the greenhouse and I bought them and I brought them back and I put them there . &quot;
and he called me into his office -- which is the equivalent of going to see the Wizard of Oz ( Laughter ) -- and John Hein@@ z had 600 million dollars , and at the time I had about 60 cents .
it &apos;s all in the way that you think about people that often determines their behavior .
and why we can &apos;t institute that policy in every school and in every city and every town remains a mystery to me .
we have smoked salmon at the art openings , we have a formal printed invitation , and I even have figured out a way to get their parents to come .
and the woman came out of the audience , she said , &quot; That was a great story and I was very impressed with your presentation .
the first question is , how did the number of deaths per year from natural disaster , how did that change during the last century ?
that &apos;s you .
not even Hans thinks that &apos;s going to happen .
the other way to think is , most things improve .
if something , yes , this is a good one , sharks are dangerous .
that &apos;s nice . so what &apos;s going to happen next ?
I would do it on my summers off from college , and I loved it .
it looked like he had just murdered somebody , which it was not out of the question for this particular architect , and we didn &apos;t know what to do .
and you can just send in a self-@@ addressed stamped envelope and we &apos;ll send you a whale .
I needed help .
it took a village to help me study metast@@ asis .
we traveled the country .
there has to be another way of doing this .
Shenzhen didn &apos;t even exist as a city .
and we mapped all the building area in Manhattan .
there are gardens and open spaces for the community , almost every unit with its own private garden , and community space all around .
and in the last two or three years , we &apos;ve actually been , for the first time , realizing the quality of life of Hab@@ it@@ at in real-life projects across Asia .
we are at a remarkable moment in time .
the roads are jammed by cars and trucks .
and let me start with cities .
and it &apos;s not just stopping deforestation .
more data allows us to see new .
he plays the computer . he wins .
my work is not meant to hide the scars of war , but to show the full frame of unseen stories of G@@ az@@ ans .
the rider had suffered critical , critical injuries .
because of her , two children had a chance they never would have had otherwise and would go on to save lives in the medical field as medical doctors .
embracing diversity became a way of life .
we are short four to seven million health workers just to meet basic needs , and the problem is everywhere .
ELAM &apos;s graduates : are they proving this audacious experiment right ?
these skills and compe@@ ten@@ cies can be summarized as business , strategic , and financial acumen .
engaging the greatness in others .
I like music , and I like ban@@ jo@@ s , and I think I probably heard Steve Martin playing , and I said , &quot; I could do that . &quot;
in England there &apos;s an expression : &quot; you can &apos;t imagine the Queen on the lo@@ o . &quot;
it was a bit of a road stopp@@ er , which was problematic because the police kept on trying to clear away the crowds , but huge fun -- it was great for me to do a performance .
so there must be other reasons for accumulating wealth than just life cycle to explain what we see in the data .
so this makes it easier to build and perpetuate large fortunes because you can consume four fifths , assuming zero tax , and you can just reinvest one fifth .
the first thing is that I think we need more financial transparency .
Thank you .
BG : Thomas Pi@@ ket@@ ty , mer@@ ci beau@@ coup .
but of course I was lucky , but that luck resulted from a series of small risks I took , starting with saying hello .
and third , you want to change your relationship with ideas .
she &apos;s getting ready for the week ahead at school .
but what &apos;s leading them to do this ?
but how do we do that ?
is it your wife ?
we &apos;ve found that sleep may actually be a kind of elegant design solution to some of the brain &apos;s most basic needs , a unique way that the brain meets the high demands and the narrow margins that set it apart from all the other organs of the body .
so what this new research tells us , then , is that the one thing that all of you already knew about sleep , that even Galen understood about sleep , that it refre@@ shes and clears the mind , may actually be a big part of what sleep is all about .
but in the brain , the consequences of falling behind may be much greater than the embarrassment of dirty counter@@ tops , because when it comes to cleaning the brain , it is the very health and function of the mind and the body that &apos;s at stake , which is why understanding these very basic house@@ keeping functions of the brain today may be critical for preventing and treating diseases of the mind tomorrow .
there is no hatred allowed in my class .
the war came when I was still a baby .
it was amazing .
OK , I keep telling students in my class , &quot; It &apos;s not about the A &apos;s ; it &apos;s about doing your best . &quot;
educating a girl will create equal and stable societies .
why is it that only six percent of the primary school students are making it to high school , simply because we do not have enough places for them ?
and the greatest benefit of them all is an education that will last .
I made friends with the kids at the camp and even started embracing some of their cultures , celebrating holidays like Christmas even though I was raised Muslim .
( Applause )
so the question that motivated us was , can we try and solve some of today &apos;s problems with the tools that we use every single day of our lives ?
so it suddenly became a bit obvious that if we wanted to move forward with this idea , we needed to do it ourselves .
we got 2@@ 2,000 votes , that &apos;s 1.2 percent of the votes , and we came in second for the local options .
I visited a camp for workers .
women are especially vulnerable to recruitment mal@@ practices .
there is no real urgency for me to send money home .
many studies show an increase in solitude and a decrease in solidarity , honesty , and social and civic participation .
three years ago , I cofounded an organization called Me@@ u Rio , and we make it easier for people in the city of Rio to organize around causes and places that they care about in their own city , and have an impact on those causes and places every day .
they look really pretty .
pretty y@@ uc@@ ky , you would agree with me .
every second in Asia and Africa , 1@@ 11 mothers will buy this bar to protect their family .
it may be uncomfortable for some to hear - business growth and lives saved somehow equated in the same sentence - but it is that business growth that allows us to keep doing more .
it is said today that biotech is advancing at least six times faster than the growth rate of the processing power of computers .
I thought the little graph of my business life that kind of looked a bit like Moore &apos;s Law -- ever upward and to the right -- it was going to go on forever .
and the reason I &apos;m telling this story is that I believe , from many conversations , that a lot of people in this room have been through a similar kind of rollercoaster -- emotional rollercoaster -- in the last couple years .
or you can view it as an evolutionary psychology kind of thing : did our genes invent this as a kind of trick to get us to behave in certain ways ? the ant &apos;s brain , parasi@@ tized , to make us behave in certain ways so that our genes would propagate ?
but he said to his mother , &quot; We &apos;re all afraid , but our determination to graduate is stronger than our fear . &quot;
H@@ any &apos;s aunt , his uncle and his cousin were murdered in their homes for refusing to leave their house .
and yet , look at what they fled : utter destruction , buildings , industries , schools , roads , homes .
it was dusty and it was terribly hot .
I believe how we treat the upro@@ oted will shape the future of our world .
University is a luxury .
in his dreams , he twir@@ ls and swir@@ ls with his toes kissing the Earth .
this is a blessing . &quot;
as he says , &quot; I &apos;m living in a broken world , and there is holy work to do . &quot;
I ner@@ ded on this hard , for years .
now , there &apos;s a group of data scientists out of the University of Illin@@ o@@ is@@ -@@ Chicago , and they &apos;re called the Health Media Col@@ laboratory , and they &apos;ve been working with the Centers for Disease Control to better understand how people talk about quitting smoking , how they talk about electronic cigarettes , and what they can do collectively to help them quit .
and what it reminds us is that language is created by people , and people are messy and we &apos;re complex and we use metaphors and slang and jargon and we do this 24 / 7 in many , many languages , and then as soon as we figure it out , we change it up .
and you can see it &apos;s a pretty rich and interesting list .
it &apos;s because in Africa , we have weak institutions , like the judi@@ ci@@ ary , the constitution , civil society and so forth .
I believe that the next generation to come after this , generation four , has a unique opportunity to transform the continent .
because none of the previous generations have been able to tackle this issue of poverty .
one very telling study looked at a program in India that gives livestock to the so-called ultra-@@ poor , and they found that 30 percent of recipients had turned around and sold the livestock they had been given for cash .
their brain does not s@@ los@@ h around like ours does .
the tradition that they tested , they tested by asking people who were on their way to work in the morning , to stop and try something out .
last year , though , we did manage to scrape up some money .
the other thing you win is an invitation to come to the ceremony , which happens at Harvard University .
and when you get there , you come to Harvard &apos;s biggest meeting place and classroom .
the basic problem , I &apos;m sure you &apos;re familiar with , that you &apos;re looking inside a long , narrow , dark place .
and then they wanted to be able to see , they needed light , so they &apos;d put in a light source , which in the 1950s was very hot .
and I look at this , and I go , well , there are tools to go deeper , longer and further : submarines , RO@@ Vs , even S@@ cu@@ ba diving .
and so with that visit , I realized that my time is short if I wanted to experience what it was like to become an a@@ quan@@ au@@ t .
you may wonder , do I ever photograph people ?
this picture is a picture of the British press cor@@ ps in Afghanistan .
so there we were at the Supreme Court arguing in front of 12 Afghan justices , me as an American female lawyer , and Sa@@ har , a young woman who when I met her couldn &apos;t speak above a whisper .
there , he uncovered a ho@@ ard of precious artifacts , jewelry , and metal@@ work , including two di@@ ade@@ ms and a copper shield .
but he had tons of friends on the infusion floor .
the confronting , not so much .
so this is one of the largest coordinated actions in human history .
and the fax was the tool of my activism .
I would argue that there has been a fundamental shift in the balance of power in the world .
so we &apos;ve talked a little bit about what new power is .
and so , what &apos;s interesting about new power , is the way it feeds on itself .
in the process , I became a civil society diplomat .
it may seem obvious , but a key ingredient to civil society diplomacy is first changing and then controlling the narrative .
in both the case of guns and drugs , we brought together a wonderful mix of people .
what happened later is that the guerrillas who came out during the Christmas tree operation and all of that said , &quot; That &apos;s really good , Christmas trees are really cool , but you know what ? we really don &apos;t walk anymore .
we &apos;re all familiar with the macro impact of urbanization , climate change , resource exploitation , but when that one last plant - or animal for that matter - when that very last specimen has disappeared from the face of this Earth , we would have lost an entire subset of the Earth &apos;s biology , and with it , important plants with medicinal potential or which could have ingredients that would speak to the cosmetic , nutrition , ph@@ ar@@ ma , and even the eth@@ no-@@ veterinary sectors , be gone forever .
evidence shows that people are better off in cities .
in danger zone I am not authorized to build .
and this is where we have more density ; it &apos;s where we have more public transport .
and 23 years after , they called us to develop -- we &apos;re developing this idea .
so our true challenge is to learn how to live with drugs so they cause the least possible harm and in some cases the greatest possible benefit .
and the first marijuana prohibition laws , all about fears of Mexican migrants in the West and the Southwest .
people tend to think of prohibition as the ultimate form of regulation when in fact it represents the ab@@ di@@ cation of regulation with criminals filling the void .
will more people use marijuana ?
what did it were higher taxes and time and place restrictions on sale and use and effective anti-@@ smoking campaigns .
there &apos;s other people who have kids , one &apos;s addicted to alcohol , the other one &apos;s addicted to cocaine or heroin , and they ask themselves the question : why does this kid get to take one step at a time and try to get better and that one &apos;s got to deal with jail and police and criminals all the time ?
for instance , the most common reaction after the failure of a business in the American continent is to go back to school .
while in Europe , the most common reaction is to look for a therapist .
( Sighs ) On the night we invented F@@ uck@@ up Ni@@ ghts , we never imagined that the movement would grow this big .
in fact , I want to confess something .
of course , failing fast is a great way to accelerate learning and avoid wasting time .
how , maybe , is it possible to use the Internet to create a new form of cinema ?
well , or other drinks , depending on where you are .
Hmm . there &apos;s a really good quote by American thinker Ha@@ ki@@ m B@@ ey which says , &quot; Every recording is a tombstone of a live performance . &quot;
this is my quest , my own little quest of what I call experimental ethno@@ graphy , trying to hybrid all those different genres , trying to regain a certain complexity .
ga@@ z@@ elles have evolved to run faster because if they don &apos;t run faster , they would be lunch .
what we want to be able to do is invest in new antibiotics in ways that actually encourage appropriate use and sales of those antibiotics , and that really is the challenge here .
I mean , you &apos;d want to find out what &apos;s going on with him , right ?
lawyers have to disclose conflicts of interests .
but his message was clear : GDP is a tool to help us measure economic performance .
markets move and trillions of dollars of capital move around the world based on which countries are going up and which countries are going down , all measured in GDP .
the Social Progress Index begins by defining what it means to be a good society based around three dimensions .
( Laughter ) And then looking at the emerging economies , top of the BR@@ IC@@ S , pleased to say , is Brazil .
it &apos;s less than half a plan , because where does Brazil want to go on social progress ?
there are the participants who have no idea why they &apos;re there .
it &apos;s &quot; you &apos;re amazing . &quot;
but I was watching these people , and I was listening to them , and they were saying , &quot; I , I do this , I do that , &quot; and there was a real un@@ familiarity between them .
twenty days later , the ice started to fall .
it was during week two that our neighbor next door opened up our door and threw a pizza across the kitchen floor , saying , &quot; I think you people might need food in there . &quot;
it was interesting .
so now , before we do this , we have to take a much closer look at actually how does the body work .
but as we &apos;ve heard so many times , these new technologies are dual-@@ edged , right ?
we can also focus on hot cities , but also hot spots .
I had thought always -- and in fact , had written this in my first book ; this was a book about gardening -- that lawns were nature under culture &apos;s boot , that they were totalitarian landscapes , and that when we mo@@ wed them we were cru@@ elly suppressing the species and never letting it set seed or die or have sex .
he can graze again , he can cut , he can bring in another species , like the lam@@ bs , or he can make hay for the winter .
that led us to wonder , is there a strategy that we could use and teach people that would help change their perceptions of the distance , help them make exercise look easier ?
so this is not the slogan from an inspirational poster .
keeping your eyes on the prize made the exercise look and feel easier even when people were working harder because they were moving faster .
I &apos;m fed up , I &apos;m grumpy , I &apos;m tired , and I &apos;m so behind , and there &apos;s a big black cloud hanging over my head , and on days like these , it looks like everyone around me is down in the dumps too .
I took him to Los Angeles to meet a foundation officer looking for support for mon@@ ies to protect their culture .
this is not an acceptable way of doing business .
this is what you find : rock car@@ vings which indigenous peoples , uncontacted peoples , used to sharpen the edge of the stone axe .
and remember , these are pre@@ literate societies .
but move from Chi@@ ri@@ bi@@ que@@ te down to the southeast , again in the Colombian Amazon .
this , in the past , is why you didn &apos;t mess with isolated Indians .
how come this has remained the high-@@ water mark ?
Scott &apos;s team covered 1,600 miles on foot .
high on the Antarctic pl@@ ateau , over 10,000 feet , it &apos;s very windy , very cold , very dry , we were exhausted .
yes and no .
and this global workforce crisis is approaching very fast .
two , a plan for how to attract great people : generation Y , women , but also reti@@ re@@ es .
but I think there &apos;s an even deeper reason .
but it turns out , this &quot; new &quot; human diagnosis was neither new , nor was it uniquely human .
with this realization , I was free from the photo@@ journalistic conventions of the newspaper and the magazine .
I became interested in the way they were choosing to represent themselves , this outward expression of masculinity , the ideal of the warrior .
four hundred and thir@@ ty-six minute by minute on a Friday night , and during that first night , the first Twitter message came : why be a chicken ?
these are sketches of some of the little details .
anyway , the poo@@ ch gets back to the diri@@ gible with the stuff .
she &apos;s managed to save the pros@@ ci@@ ut@@ to , but in the process she loses the tablecloth , which you can see flying away in the upper left-hand corner .
and then I thought , that &apos;s too complicated . no , I &apos;ll just take my favorite bits and pieces and I &apos;ll put them inside the Pantheon but keep the scale , so you can see the top of S@@ ant &apos;I@@ vo and the Pyrami@@ d of C@@ esti@@ us and the T@@ empi@@ et@@ to of Bra@@ man@@ te all side by side in this amazing space .
if it was a hom@@ ing pigeon , it would be called &quot; Homer &apos;s Odyssey . &quot;
and it becomes necessary and possible , at this point , to try to convey what that sense would be like of flying over the city without actually moving .
past the Pyrami@@ d of C@@ esti@@ us -- these will seem very familiar to you , even if you haven &apos;t been to Rome recently -- past the gate@@ house .
this is something that &apos;s a little bit unusual .
why do you think I &apos;m showing you these beautiful black men behind me ?
who &apos;s in your circle ?
I mean , you just have to do it .
we &apos;ve got to take our lovely dar@@ lings , our future , and we &apos;ve got to tell them we have an amazing country with incredible ideals , we have worked incredibly hard , and we have made some progress , but we are not done .
while preparing for my talk I was reflecting on my life and trying to figure out where exactly was that moment when my journey began .
I always used to think that my beginning was one afternoon in my community when my mother had told me that I had escaped three arranged marriages by the time I was two .
things got so bad that I had to hide myself in many ways .
and so it began .
KB : Thank you so much . CA : Thank you , Kh@@ ali@@ da . ( Applause )
OK , so that was Top Ti@@ p # 2 .
now , I think it &apos;s important to point out at this stage , that these exact equations have also been shown to be perfectly able at describing what happens between two countries in an arms race .
so for the next couple of years , I started to experiment with live@@ streaming in different ways , not only in the streets but mostly in studios and in homes , until the beginning of 2013 , last year , when I became the cofounder of a group called M@@ í@@ dia NI@@ N@@ JA .
some our images were responsible to take some people out of jail , people who were being arrested unfairly under false accusations , and we could prove them innocent .
Google showed that it is possible to find information by using a computer algorithm , and this algorithm is based on machine learning .
since that time , there have been many commercial successes of machine learning .
the translation to Chinese and the text in the top right , deep learning , and the construction of the voice was deep learning as well .
this algorithm developed out of Switzerland by people , none of whom speak or understand any Chinese .
and using this kind of process for each of the different groups , we are now up to an 80 percent success rate in classi@@ fying the 1.5 million images .
there are other ways to reward yet .
believe it or not , there are over 20 million catadores worldwide .
we took &quot; k@@ um@@ qu@@ at &quot; from Chinese , we took &quot; car@@ amel &quot; from French .
in 1989 , I had an artwork that became the center of controversy over its transgre@@ ssive use of the American flag .
I received numerous death threats , and bomb threats were phoned in to my school .
it wouldn &apos;t have been safe for me to be there , to say the least .
so what do I mean by color changes ?
so this video was sent to me by a design student at Yale .
once we play that note and magnify the motions 250 times , we can very clearly see how the glass vibr@@ ates and resonates in response to the sound .
can we actually in@@ vert this process and recover sound from video by analyzing the tiny vibrations that sound waves create in objects , and essentially convert those back into the sounds that produced them .
MR : we used &quot; Mary Had a Little Lamb &quot; because those are said to be the first words that Thomas Edison spoke into his phon@@ ograph in 18@@ 77 .
El@@ i Lil@@ ly -- in , again , the fiercely competitive pharmaceutical world -- has created a market for solutions for pharmaceutical problems .
Wikipedia has used thousands of volunteers to create a free encyclopedia with a million and a half articles in 200 languages in just a couple of years .
as they do so , they transport fertilizer in the form of their feces from places that have it to places that need it .
whale carcasses are also known to transport about 19@@ 0,000 tons of carbon , which is the equivalent of that produced by 80,000 cars per year from the atmosphere to the deep oceans , and the deep oceans are what we call &quot; carbon sinks , &quot; because they trap and hold excess carbon from the atmosphere , and therefore help to delay global warming .
amongst other things , we need to stop them from getting p@@ lowed down by container ships when they &apos;re in their feeding areas , and stop them from getting entangled in fishing nets as they float around in the ocean .
I have a confession to make .
I &apos;m not entirely sure why I took a different route that day , a de@@ tour .
how was that possible ?
so we started appropri@@ ating that hell ; we plunged ourselves , head@@ first , into the seventh circle .
we decided that they were going to write a book .
but the most important thing here is that the very people who are supposed to defend us , the police , the military , are the ones that committed most of the crimes .
and what you see there is the state following individuals , people that , like you , wanted to change their country , and they j@@ ot@@ ted everything down .
( Applause )
we can hold ourselves accountable to making sure our decisions are driven by ethics and safety .
last year , in seven months alone , China was able to install a whopping 35 gigawatts of solar power .
what they do on carbon trading , on clean energy , on air pollution , we can learn many lessons .
it is protected by the Antarctic Treaty , signed in 1959 .
I found it incredibly inspiring that the idea of becoming a polar traveler went down pretty well with girls at parties when I was at university .
once there , the hero found the titan Atlas holding up the heavens .
apart from all those products , the forest is very important for climate regulation .
this is more than what the Amazon River , which is the largest river in the world , puts in the sea per day , which is 17 billion tons .
then we made the connection that areas that have been doing illegal deforestation should not get any kind of credit or finance .
fifty million hectares of protected areas were created , which is an area the size of Spain .
when you grow up in a developing country like India , as I did , you instantly learn to get more value from limited resources and find creative ways to reuse what you already have .
this factory is 10 percent the size of existing Dan@@ one factories and cost much less to build .
let me quickly give you three examples of startups that personally inspire me .
now we have vastly over@@ run some of the planetary boundaries .
you will not play at the cas@@ ino with the resources that people have en@@ trusted you with .
so now , on top of that , the quality of human relationships .
in the future , we do more with less , and we continue to grow qualitatively , not quanti@@ tatively .
we need a caring economics .
you become your nation . you become your religion .
I remember being on a plane going from Kenya to South Africa , and I had no idea where I was .
we all know that ants and other insects at this size scale can do some pretty incredible things .
well , first we need to figure out how to make them move when they &apos;re so small .
the hard material here is silicon , and the soft material is si@@ lic@@ one rubber .
what is it ?
by adding all the digits in 12@@ 10 together , we get 4 - the total number of digits .
there &apos;s more information available today and more advanced technology to preserve it , though we can &apos;t know for sure that our digital archives will be more resistant to destruction than Alexandria &apos;s ink and paper sc@@ rolls .
of all the gay , lesbian and bisexual employees , 83 percent admitted to changing some aspects of themselves so they would not appear at work &quot; too gay . &quot;
we got it out of the drawers , and we proposed that perhaps we could get a human being that is paralyzed to actually use the brain-@@ machine interface to regain mobility .
( Laughter ) But that &apos;s a different talk , and a different neuroscientist needs to talk about that .
so if I &apos;m understanding correctly , one of the monkeys is actually getting a signal and the other monkey is reacting to that signal just because the first one is receiving it and transmitting the neurological impulse .
on the most part , we were producing bio@@ gas , bio@@ gas for rural kitchens .
human waste , in its ra@@ west form , finds its way back to drinking water , bathing water , washing water , irrigation water , whatever water you see .
but we discovered that if you plant banana trees , papaya trees on the periphery of these le@@ ach pits , they grow very well because they suck up all the nutrients and you get very tasty bananas , pap@@ ay@@ as .
so there were less than nine percent of girl children attending school , even if there was a school .
I want to speak about a forgotten conflict .
to them , the violence they see is the consequence of tensions between President Kab@@ ila and various national opponents , and tensions between Congo , Rwanda and Uganda .
and that happens not only in Congo but also in many other conflict zones .
I struggled and tried to get her off me , but I couldn &apos;t .
I was a black angry woman . ( Laughter ) Oh yeah .
and she said , &quot; Why ? &quot; he said they were dirty .
it &apos;s saying that women don &apos;t have a right to sexual pleasure .
( Applause )
suicide rates among adults ages 40 to 64 have risen nearly 40 percent since 1999 .
are you lonely ?
did you run with the candy store , or did you run to the bank ?
looking back at the Starbucks meeting with my brother ...
it only takes one person in your family to break through the money-@@ shame cycle .
( Laughter ) And especially a section of your body ...
we &apos;re going to roll our hips together , OK ?
you &apos;re just going to have to roll your hips like that .
teach me , teach me , teach me , teach me .
he purchased his own plane ticket , and went to the village where this had occurred .
today , it would be so much easier .
you have to trust these people in these space suits to do that for you .
but how did Ebola end up in L@@ ofa County in the first place ?
what we saw was we could bend that curve , so to speak , change this exponential growth , and bring some hope back to the ability to control this outbreak .
you &apos;ve heard of your IQ , your general intelligence , but what &apos;s your Psy@@ -@@ Q ?
so it &apos;s not really a case of Mars and Venus .
one thing that you shouldn &apos;t blame is being a left-@@ brained or right-@@ brained learner , because again , this is a myth .
but what is true is that ambi@@ dex@@ tr@@ ous people , or people who use both hands for different tasks , are more creative thinkers than one-@@ handed people , because being ambi@@ dex@@ tr@@ ous involves having both sides of the brain talk to each other a lot , which seems to be involved in creative and flexible thinking .
the people who preferred Mozart music to the stories got a bigger IQ boost from the Mozart than the stories , but the people who preferred the stories to the Mozart music got a bigger IQ boost from listening to the Stephen King stories than the Mozart music .
OK , so I &apos;ve been talking for about 12 minutes now , and you &apos;ve probably been sitting there listening to me , analyzing my speech patterns and body language and trying to work out if you should take any notice of what I &apos;m saying , whether I &apos;m telling the truth or whether I &apos;m lying .
you can see the step by step analysis that takes place , and as they build up their model , they move their nodes around , rearranging them like Lego blocks .
so sticky note systems are not only more fluid , they generally produce way more nodes than static drawings .
so next time you &apos;re confronted with an interesting challenge , remember what design has to teach us .
and with this hand I &apos;m controlling the volume , so the further away my right hand gets , the louder it gets .
( Laughter ) Maybe we &apos;ll go into the next tune , because I totally lost where this is going .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But for me , single-@@ mindedness is not just caring about something .
so if that &apos;s the case , maybe your employee base should be 13 percent Black and 18 percent Hispanic , because that &apos;s what the population looks like .
this is optically similar to human brain .
so , that &apos;s the orange light that &apos;s coming off of the sonic spot , that &apos;s changed color slightly , and we create a glowing disc of orange light underneath a neighboring chip and then record a hologram on the camera chip .
this is significant , because every tumor bigger than a cubic millimeter or two has five times the amount of blood as normal flesh .
compact , portable , inexpensive medical imaging can save countless lives .
and I decided to create an AI composer .
so , using deep neural networks , AIVA looks for patterns in the scores .
so , as you &apos;ve seen , AI can create beautiful pieces of music , and the best part of it is that humans can actually bring them to life .
we have come up with ways to protect ourselves against these diseases .
and we &apos;re conscious -- we learn from our experiences and come up with creative solutions .
most famous , perhaps , chimpanzees .
in this way , elephants have told us how to treat stomach upset , and por@@ cup@@ ines have told people how to treat bloody diarrhea .
and you say , &quot; I &apos;m going to spend more time with the kids .
so we started this about 30 years ago , and we started dealing with this very issue .
we have all kinds of things where we say , don &apos;t worry about the course material anymore .
( Applause ) So over the years , we started going into other things .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I keep thinking of Warren Buff@@ et waking up one day and finding out he has 30 billion dollars more than he thought he had .
and the first time around , I saw these tom@@ b@@ stones and these wonderful people who &apos;d done great things and I thought , what do I want to be remembered for ?
and I did another stro@@ ll around , and the second time , another question came to me , which did me better , which was , why do I want to be remembered at all ?
( Laughter ) Which is good .
and yet so deeply wise , also .
how do we help you move these ideas forward ?
do you have any other questions for us , for TED , for this group here ?
it means that when I show you a building like this , I know what you think : you think &quot; power &quot; and &quot; stability &quot; and &quot; democracy . &quot;
it takes a long time to build a building , three or four years , and in the inter@@ im , an architect will design two or eight or a hundred other buildings before they know if that building that they designed four years ago was a success or not .
and it means that buildings will twist to the whi@@ ms of nature instead of the other way around .
and thousands of people were left with very significant neurological damage .
this would mean that no one in the city has ever had contact with the disease .
vaccines , like other drugs , can have potential adverse effects .
( Laughter ) I &apos;ll now address Case B .
the attacking ones are mathematicians who would tell you this question makes no sense , because mathematics have a meaning all their own -- a beautiful edi@@ fice with its own logic -- and that there &apos;s no point in constantly searching for all possible applications .
&quot; if you don &apos;t know math , your bridge will collapse . &quot;
and now these guys have also started saying that behind information security and credit cards are prime numbers .
how do you discover the uniqueness of a project as unique as a person ?
( Laughter ) And the client was happy -- well , sort of happy because we were four million dollars over the budget , but essentially happy .
I glan@@ ced down at the phone , and I realized I had kicked it off the hook when pacing the day before .
in addition to exploring ambiguity , k@@ ō@@ ans often ridiculed characters claiming total understanding of the world around them .
of course , all these interpretations only hint at how to wrestle with these k@@ ō@@ ans .
and then one day , my colleague walked into my office , and he said , &quot; Dr. Burke , have you seen this ? &quot;
the reason for this has to do with the hypo@@ thal@@ am@@ ic-@@ pitu@@ it@@ ary-@@ adrenal axis , the brain &apos;s and body &apos;s stress response system that governs our fight-or-flight response .
the science is clear : early adversity dramatically affects health across a lifetime .
of course , that &apos;s not why U@@ mm E@@ l-@@ Sa@@ ad joined the program .
out of all the women I met , F@@ ay@@ za from Yemen affected me the most .
you see , ever since the 1970s , when organ transplants became a real option for patients with kidney failure and other organ diseases , organ supply has been an issue .
it is called the por@@ c@@ ine endo@@ genous retro@@ virus ( PE@@ R@@ V ) , and this virus has the potential to cause a viral epidemic similar to HIV .
L@@ Y : that &apos;s a good point .
but it &apos;s a deeply rewarding one , with an epic ass@@ ort@@ ment of intense rom@@ ances , civil war , political intrigue , glo@@ be-@@ tro@@ tting adventur@@ ers , and more characters named Au@@ reli@@ ano than you &apos;d think possible .
great trip , having a great time , good conversation .
they were in the parking lot , I went inside .
I have master &apos;s , Ph.D. , under@@ grad , one in medical school .
so we &apos;re just trying to get him to stay in school .
and I think as a city we can do a little better than that as well .
what you see is inland waterways .
that makes sense , right ?
so one is street name , intersection street , street , borough , address , building , building address .
( Laughter ) This was being sold to high-school administrators for $ 900 api@@ ece .
what &apos;s more likely : that Arnold had extraterrestrial help in his run for the govern@@ orship , or that the &quot; World We@@ e@@ kly News &quot; makes stuff up ?
I think you need to be more explicit here in step two . &quot;
he charged five bucks a head to come see the nun bu@@ n till he got a ce@@ ase-@@ and-@@ desi@@ st from Mother Teresa &apos;s lawyer .
it turns out wherever there &apos;s a sprink@@ ler head and a palm tree , you get the effect .
we know within precise error bars how close it is .
every time you go to an area where for 43 years of independence , we still don &apos;t have basic health facilities .
this is great for most kids . right ?
this is a family of gi@@ bb@@ ons .
but let &apos;s take a moment to talk about saving the rainforest , because it &apos;s something that we &apos;ve definitely all heard about forever .
and yet here we are today , about half of the rainforest remains , and we have potentially more urgent problems like climate change .
so these companies aren &apos;t going to give us our privacy .
at that time , we were working at the European Organization for N@@ uclear Research at the world &apos;s largest particle colli@@ der , which colli@@ des protons , by the way .
and that &apos;s actually the key design challenge : how do we take all this complexity , all this software , and implement it in a way that the user cannot see it .
and I think the answer is actually yes , because today , we &apos;ve reached a point where people around the world really understand how important privacy is , and when you have that , anything is possible .
it doesn &apos;t matter who the man was , all that matters was that sentence ringing in my head : &quot; I will not touch the deck till the end . &quot;
the old man turned to me and he said , &quot; You could pick a red card or a black card . &quot;
so after the seven , we have a nine .
towards the end of the fight , he slammed me up against the wall , so while we were tus@@ sled up , he said to me , &quot; You good ? &quot;
so why not try to mentor these young people while they &apos;re there ?
the U.S. At@@ tor@@ ney General recently released a report stating that they &apos;re going to ban solitary confinement in New York state for teens .
you force those words to connect to what you want to think of and form ideas .
in the end he was only ready one minute early , But it didn &apos;t matter because she arrived one minute late .
( Applause ) That was the first poem that I wrote and it was for a prime number-@@ the@@ med poetry night -- ( Laughter ) -- which turned out to be a prime number-@@ the@@ med poetry competition .
it hadn &apos;t always been like this .
in a universe of adversity these stars stuck together , And though days became nights the memories would last forever , Whe@@ ther the weather@@ man said it or not , it would be fine , &apos; Cause even behind the clouds the kid could still shine .
I mean , I thought it was a great idea , but I started building k@@ ay@@ aks .
that &apos;s July &apos; 58 .
in total , we spent hundreds of hours on the ground , on-site , watching these leaders in action .
the other thing about a Pixar movie is that no part of the movie is considered finished until the entire movie wraps .
creative agility is about being able to test and refine that portfolio of ideas through quick pursuit , reflection and adjust@@ ment .
instead of creating a group to tackle this task , they decided to allow groups to emerge spontaneously around different alternatives .
it &apos;s because they &apos;ve mastered the capabilities required for that .
we need to find better ways to remember them .
I wasn &apos;t in a good mood , so I insulted him .
four days before my ev@@ ent@@ ful release , four hostages were be@@ headed a few miles away from where I was kept in captivity .
now , I &apos;m an architect , and for the past year and a half I &apos;ve been looking at these changes and at what they mean for architecture related to death and dying .
hospital architecture has earned its bad reputation .
consider these two alternative scenarios .
Africa shall rise .
many studies also exclusively focused on white , middle-class women , which makes it problematic to apply study findings to all women .
not all women , not most women , not the majority of women , not even a lot of women : three to eight percent .
repu@@ table Internet sources of medical information like Web@@ MD or the May@@ o Clinic list PMS as a known disorder .
or , with the retinal implant , you take a camera and you digitize the signal , and then you plug an electrode grid directly into the optic nerve .
so I think there &apos;s really no end to the possibilities on the horizon for human expansion .
you always take the risk that something like this won &apos;t work onstage , right ?
( Laughter ) Of course , life is full of surprises .
instead , this scandal was brought to you by the digital revolution .
today , I want to share some of my experience with you , talk about how that experience has helped shape my cultural observations , and how I hope my past experience can lead to a change that results in less suffering for others .
cruelty to others is nothing new .
( video ) Girl : okay , that &apos;s a cat sitting in a bed .
we have made fabulous meg@@ api@@ x@@ el cameras , but we have not delivered sight to the blind .
cameras can take pictures like this one by converting lights into a two-dimensional array of numbers known as pixels , but these are just lifeless numbers .
once , I even joked to my graduate students that I would just re@@ open my dry cleaner &apos;s shop to fund Ima@@ ge@@ Net .
after all , that &apos;s how I funded my college years .
in 2009 , the Ima@@ ge@@ Net project delivered a database of 15 million images across 2@@ 2,000 classes of objects and things organized by everyday English words .
we were thrilled to have put together Ima@@ ge@@ Net , and we wanted the whole research world to benefit from it , so in the TED fashion , we opened up the entire data set to the worldwide research community for free .
sometimes , when the computer is not so confident about what it sees , we have taught it to be smart enough to give us a safe answer instead of committing too much , just like we would do , but other times our computer algorithm is remarkable at telling us what exactly the objects are , like the make , model , year of the cars .
it &apos;s an incredible accomplishment , but it &apos;s only the first step .
his fi@@ an@@ c@@ é@@ e left him .
what I thought might be a six-month st@@ int in Mumbai stretched to six years .
he &apos;d heard a similar tale about the man who shot him back when he attended his trial .
his mother told him , regre@@ tfully , as a boy that she &apos;d been just 50 dollars short of abor@@ ting him .
sometimes , that little boy would be at school , he &apos;d suddenly pull a knife on his fellow classmates .
but it is losing its lu@@ ster at allowing every American to become a somebody .
it was stin@@ ky and it took up a lot of space in my studio , but I asked my dad if he would be willing to make some art with me , if we could reimagine this kind of nothing material as something very special .
and , &quot; What &apos;s your sustainability plan ? &quot;
T@@ G : I believe that beauty is a basic service .
don &apos;t argue , do as you &apos;re told .
I found myself alone , and I didn &apos;t know what to do .
it has been done in Uganda and other countries , and what is most powerful is that the images have been picked by the media and amplified across the country , across the continent .
traditionally , broadcast documentary has been about recording interviews to create a work of art or entertainment or education that is seen or heard by a whole lot of people , but I wanted to try something where the interview itself was the purpose of this work , and see if we could give many , many , many people the chance to be listened to in this way .
in the interview , she talks with her daughter Les@@ ley about joining a gang as a young man , and later in life transitioning into the woman she was always meant to be .
so the first part of the wish is already underway .
although women were then coming out of the universities with decent degrees , there was a glass ceiling to our progress .
our late son , G@@ iles , was an only child , a beautiful , cont@@ ented baby .
I like doing new things and making new things happen .
how poetic .
now , moving forward , how do I manage today ?

you &apos;ve experienced sonar .
Brian Bus@@ h@@ way : it &apos;s not a matter of enjoying it more or less , it &apos;s about enjoying it differently .
generally , it &apos;s kind of a fuzzy three-dimensional geometry .
thanks so much for that , truly . DK : Thank you .
the best lessons , I think , on how to get prepared are again , what we do for war .
it will go to the absolute core .
so where does that conclude in terms of the great question that we &apos;ve been asked to address this evening , which is the future of U.S.@@ -@@ China relations ?
Chris Milk : so this was my joy back then .
I started making music videos .
he cries a lot .
it connects humans to other humans in a profound way that I &apos;ve never seen before in any other form of media .
and the expensive pain medication worked better .
but what happened in more important questions ?
how do we even figure this out ?
nobody thought that socialism is a fantastic idea in our sample .
yeah , look at this . you know , all kinds of different ...
( Laughter ) DH : let &apos;s jump this way , though .
DH : just do it juggler boys , you say ?
that &apos;s the first time when it was def@@ lected by Jupiter , and it got close enough to the sun to start changing .
now , this sounds more heroic than it actually is , because the technology to use radio isotope thermal generators wasn &apos;t available in Europe at that time , so there was no choice .
two dust particles : the right one they call Bor@@ is , and they shot it with tantal@@ um in order to be able to analyze it .
I will never forget -- absolute madness , 250 TV crews in Germany .
I was only 18 , and I got a job working as an interpreter .
Thank you .
but in this kindergarten , there is no reason they get nervous .
it was 10 o &apos;clock .
I cannot explain my joy when I free a child .
who or what inspires you and why ?
it &apos;s a system I love because of the successes and opportunities it &apos;s afforded me and millions of others .
now , over the past 50 years , we as a society have come to view our companies and corporations in a very narrow , almost mon@@ om@@ ani@@ ac@@ al fashion with regard to how we value them , and we have put so much emphasis on profits , on short-term quarterly earnings and share prices , at the exclusion of all else .
this is when I was a little girl . I would &apos;ve been about six .
you could be sta@@ mping on somebody , it &apos;s having the same effect .
so Robert Pro@@ vine , who has done a lot of work on this , has pointed out that you are 30 times more likely to laugh if you are with somebody else than if you &apos;re on your own , and where you find most laughter is in social interactions like conversation .
it turns out that tears just aren &apos;t much help when you &apos;re trying to investigate a genocide .
talk to us a bit about some of the things that have actually been happening to , for example , boost police training .
in 19@@ 20 , for example , you weren &apos;t allowed to drink ; if you were a woman , you weren &apos;t allowed to vote ; and if you looked up at the stars and the Milky Way on a summer night , what you saw was thought to be the entire universe .
I want to give you a couple examples from my own work .
this pesticide is very specific to caterpillar pests , and in fact , it &apos;s non@@ toxic to humans , fish and birds .
in the genetic approach , scientists cut the gene out of the bacteria and insert it directly into the egg@@ plant genome .
this is the same pigment that we find in carrots .
PR : Thank you very much . I appreciate it .
( Applause ) Yeah , yeah !
what we do know is that the ultimate limit to information processing in a machine substrate lies far outside the limits in biological tissue .
there are also size limitations , like a human brain has to fit inside a cran@@ ium , but a computer can be the size of a warehouse or larger .
it &apos;s likely , rather , to swo@@ osh right by .
it &apos;s extremely good at using available means to achieve a state in which its goal is realized .
but it doesn &apos;t happen automatically .
but anyway , since Chuck was 18 , this ag@@ g@@ . assault case sent him to adult county jail on State Road in northeast Philadelphia , where he sat , unable to pay the bail -- he couldn &apos;t afford it -- while the trial dates dragged on and on and on through almost his entire senior year .
and then a juvenile judge , a few days later , charged Tim , age 11 , with access@@ ory to receiving a stolen property and then he was placed on three years of probation .
we &apos;re seeing states throw out Stop and F@@ risk as the civil rights violation that it is .
at this point , she &apos;d rowed over 200,000 strokes , fighting the current and the wind .

then the tissue in their body re@@ organizes and the pigment slowly develops in their eyes .
he and his brother run the largest bee@@ keeping operation in the world , and the USDA is integrating their mit@@ e-@@ resistant bees into his operation with the hope that over time , they &apos;ll be able to select the bees that are not only mit@@ e-@@ resistant but also retain all of these qualities that make them useful to us .

and never has infidelity exac@@ ted such a psychological toll .
and then another message : &quot; can &apos;t wait to hold you in my arms . &quot;
that in itself is a desire machine , because the in@@ comple@@ teness , the ambiguity , keeps you wanting that which you can &apos;t have .
but some of them will merely survive , and others will actually be able to turn a crisis into an opportunity .
but I &apos;m not the one who did it . &quot;
he needs to become , for a while , the protector of the boundaries .
would you like to create a second one together ?
and I found it , I am sorry to say , sadly lacking .
Narrator : number one , keep it simple .
TK : because you can &apos;t read that at a distance .
so here &apos;s a bunch of flags again .
and he tells in his book how every single one them , almost every one of them , is an orphan who saw his mother and father die before his eyes .
on the other side of that legal wall are the legal persons .
they count in law .
and a legal cause of action is a vehicle that lawyers use to put their arguments in front of courts .
and the supreme interest in the common law are the rights to autonomy and self-determination .
Tommy is a chimpanzee . you see him behind me .
I wouldn &apos;t blame you , because every time I look at this Arctic selfie , I shi@@ ver just a little bit .
today , if I could respond to my students with a letter of my own , which is of course impossible , I would tell them this : &quot; my dear gentlemen , It &apos;s been a bit over three years since I last saw you .
and now , you must be 22 -- maybe even as old as 23 .
both my mom and I required physical therapy , a process of doing a suite of repetitive exercises in order to regain the range of movement lost due to an accident or injury .
I can follow my therapist &apos;s example on the left side of the screen , while on the right , I see myself doing the recommended movement .
CA : but you didn &apos;t accept that as the limit of what you could do .
they made a decision not to develop any medicines for rare and orphan diseases , and maybe you could use your expertise in satellite communications to develop this cure for pulmonary hypertension .
MR : what this graph means , and it comes from Ray Kurzweil , is that the rate of development in computer processing hardware , fir@@ m@@ ware and software , has been advancing along a curve such that by the 20@@ 20s , as we saw in earlier presentations today , there will be information technology that processes information and the world around us at the same rate as a human mind .
CA : and so that being so , you &apos;re actually getting ready for this world by believing that we will soon be able to , what , actually take the contents of our brains and somehow preserve them forever ?
CA : now you &apos;re not just messing around with this .
besides , we need to see you .
five . four . three . two . one .
so nothing is possible without an amazing team of people .
it &apos;s somewhat warm .
and here &apos;s our sun , the white light of our sun split up , not by rain@@ drops , but by a spectro@@ graph .
and that red light is just scattered light in the camera optics .
I wanted my own television ministry .
as soon as the question , &quot; Why me ? &quot; came , the answer came just as quickly : why me ? because I &apos;m the one who can &apos;t sleep at night thinking about it .
after about two weeks of volunteering at the high school , I realized that the youth that I was trying to reach , they weren &apos;t going to high school .
I started to walk in the community , and it didn &apos;t take a rocket scientist to realize that they weren &apos;t out during the day .
I imagine we were quite the anomaly when we first started walking .
a son and his father are in a horrible car accident .
to get the same number of interviews as someone with an An@@ glo@@ -@@ Saxon name , if you were Chinese , you had to send out 68 percent more applications .
if we are going to escape biology , how are we going to do it ?
they see it as a recipe for narrow@@ ness , regre@@ ssion , and global poverty .
if you &apos;re a prophet and you believe that key to solving today &apos;s growing shortage of fresh water is to stop wasting it , you have to worry that cities around the world , in rich places as well as poor , routinely lose a quarter or more of their water to leaky and contaminated pipes .
this isn &apos;t likely how you think about the FBI .
these include the Boston Mar@@ athon bombings in 2013 , as well as failed attacks , such as the time when a man named Fa@@ is@@ al Sha@@ h@@ z@@ ad tried to deliver a car bomb to Times Square .
both are mentally ill .
Thank you .
until , it was quite am@@ using , about a year ago somebody said , &quot; You &apos;ve been invited to do a TED Talk . &quot;
so whilst going , and don &apos;t worry , I didn &apos;t when I arrived with these tribes , I didn &apos;t paint myself yellow and run around with these spears and lo@@ in@@ clo@@ ths .
it &apos;s because they have these extraordinary rituals .
we poll a tiny fraction of the elec@@ torate and we predict the outcome of national elections .
and the kinds of gener@@ alizations babies have to make about ducks and balls they have to make about almost everything : shoes and ships and se@@ aling wax and ca@@ bb@@ ages and kings .
let &apos;s watch what she does .
I &apos;ve just shown you two laboratory experiments out of literally hundreds in the field that make similar points , because the really critical point is that children &apos;s ability to make rich inferences from sparse data underlies all the species-@@ specific cultural learning that we do .
you know about objects and their properties .
our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing , and our latest point would put it on , now , an exponential curve .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of DNA -- 30 to 50 letters in length -- and it &apos;s a de@@ generate process , so the longer you make the piece , the more errors there are .
obviously , with a virus it &apos;s pretty simple ; it &apos;s much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
I wanted to find a way to normal@@ ize this transition , to explain that discomfort is not always the same thing as disease .
and we need to respect and acknowledge the fact that sustainable security builds on a foundation of human rights .
first , the idea .
I tried to look at what factors actually accounted the most for success and failure across all of these companies , and the results really surprised me .
you just wanted to eat the piece of fruit .
I simply picked up the piece of fruit , dug at it with my nails , tried to flick it off , and then wondered , &quot; Was there another sticker ? &quot;
as she was going to her destination , she noticed the driver opening the window to clean off the excess snow so he could drive safely .
but still , years later , people were not saving any energy because they just couldn &apos;t predict the future .
I remember the thick , straight hair , and how it would come around me like a curtain when she bent to pick me up ; her soft , southern Thai accent ; the way I would cling to her , even if she just wanted to go to the bathroom or get something to eat .
that is food and care and shelter .
and somehow , these most essential workers are also among the world &apos;s most underpaid and exploited today .
this case hit me so hard .
if we ended recruitment fees for migrant workers ?
if we decided that guest workers should have the right to organize without fear of retaliation ?
you can call it racism or colonialism , but the labels don &apos;t matter as much as the fact that over the last century , Native American rights and culture were taken from them .
when you walk the halls of a museum , you &apos;re likely just seeing about one percent of the total collections .
fast forwar@@ ding a decade later to 2012 , I was entering my third low-@@ performing school as principal .
( Laughter ) And they respond by saying , &quot; Because we like feeling special . &quot;
today , I &apos;d like tell you what that assumption is , why it &apos;s false , and how to fix it .
he wrote : &quot; I think that tastes , odors , colors , and so on reside in consciousness .
could we really be mis@@ interpreting our experiences that badly ?
well , fortunately , we have a very helpful metaphor : the desktop interface on your computer .
we had misinterpreted our perceptions .
we haven &apos;t done these simulations , but my bet is that we &apos;ll find that there are some selection pressures for our logic and our mathematics to be at least in the direction of truth .
so class , hopefully you &apos;ll recognize what you just heard me say as the -- ?
the third woman , who actually was a so-called sex worker did not agree that it was liberating but she wanted the right to the economic empowerment , and then we hear the fourth woman saying not only prostitution itself but pros@@ cri@@ bed roles for women in general prevented her from ever finding who she was , right ?
but the whole point of this thing is for them to look at this chart and fill it out .
and it &apos;s interesting .
and I &apos;m dropping a little dot for each one of these things ; they &apos;re evenly spaced because they &apos;re 30 apart .
Thank you .
fourth generation in a lineage of women , I was raised under the protection and care of Grandma Ruby , off 8@@ th Street at 8@@ 05 Washington Avenue .
I mean , obviously when you have something all the way through your hand , it &apos;s kind of bad anyway , but in this case , sea urchins have a venom on them that , if you &apos;ve ever tangled with them , you know that a sea urchin spine in you gives you horrible , painful inflammation .
I just remember thinking , &quot; I can &apos;t get my glove off with these in here . &quot;
she was from Mexico , she left her family behind so she could come here and afford them a better life back home .
and the small victory I feel when I make it by and don &apos;t have to let go .
what can you do to hold just a few more ?
but then I take my niece off my shoulders , and she runs to El@@ sa and Anna -- the thing she &apos;s been waiting so long for -- and all that stuff goes away .
and I realize in that moment that I don &apos;t have to be either an aunt or an advocate , I can be both .
they were so focused on their own individual work , they didn &apos;t even know who they were sitting next to , and it was only when I insisted that we stop working and invest time in getting to know each other that we achieved real momentum .
social capital is the reliance and inter@@ dependency that builds trust .
I have another confession .
( Laughter ) &quot; Make it work with your wet t-shirt .
I want them to thrive in a world where they are valued for the powerful creatures they are .
I learned to write like them , and then I learned to write as myself .
but worst of all were his mangled cau@@ li@@ flower ears .
but in some cases , like after a patient had a leg amputated , that patient might still complain of pain in that nonexistent leg .
over the next several years , they quietly worked with the American Psy@@ chi@@ atric Association to broaden the criteria for diagnosis to reflect the diversity of what they called &quot; the autism spectrum . &quot;
so what the hell was that ?
so clarity .
( Laughter ) I recommend you all do this .
it is time to celebrate all the un@@ sung heroines who reach into their guts and find the heart and the grit to keep going and to test every limit .
this is the front of the brain , the back of brain with the spinal cord hanging down , and this is how it would be positioned inside of my head .
it &apos;s that calculating intelligence that reminds me when I have to do my laundry .
( Laughter ) &quot; I don &apos;t have time for a stroke ! &quot;
in the meantime , for 45 minutes , the hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphere .
so he recognizes that I need help and he gets me help .
so there &apos;s a pretty big gap there .
then we know where the car is in the moment , but we have to do better than that : we have to predict what &apos;s going to happen .
according to him , the role of storytelling is to mimic life and make us feel emotions .
I would like you , the people here at TED , to tell your own story .
so Vicky and I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen , because it will all be based on your decisions .
DC : OK , she &apos;s not really happy .
her daughter &apos;s been taken hostage by an andro@@ id , and of course , she &apos;s in a state of shock .
captain Allen : let &apos;s fire at everything that moves .
Cap@@ t A : I haven &apos;t got a clue . does it matter ?
so imagine how it felt just four years later to be sitting in a boardroom in front of someone who I knew could make that dream come true .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) You could imagine it would be quite difficult to sleep in that situation , even as a passenger .
and I thought to myself , well , that &apos;s well outside my lifetime , and a much greater figure than the predictions for oil .
it &apos;s brought huge volatility in prices , so much so that in 2011 , your average European car manufacturer saw a raw material price increase of 500 million Euro@@ s , wiping away half their operating profits through something they have absolutely no control over .
could the circular economy replace current chemical fertilizer use ? &quot;
it wasn &apos;t that mobile , to be fair , but now it really is , and as my great-grandfather left this Earth , the Internet arrived .
and this is done by members of her own family , so the family becomes murderers when the girl brings so-called dis@@ grace to the family .
those are the kinds of things that go on in our society .
so what are these dots ?
it was one of the most exciting games in basketball .
and our ability to know the shot probability for every player at every second , and the likelihood of them getting a rebound at every second can illuminate this moment in a way that we never could before .
( Laughter ) And we recreated the tracking that led to the insights .
we &apos;re moving in our homes , in our offices , as we shop and we travel throughout our cities and around our world .
but one year later , I had a terrible accident as I left a pub one dark night with friends , in Scotland .
and so , whilst focusing on my breath , I had a strong sense of cal@@ m@@ ness , but I was certain that I was going to die .
I was going through a hard time as well .
those were the imaginations that were going through my mind every day .
why can &apos;t I change something that has happened for a long time in our community ? &quot;
that was when I was like , &apos; Why can &apos;t we take all these things that are happening to us and present them and tell our mothers , our traditional leaders , that these are the wrong things ? &quot;
however , nowadays we are really facing new complex , intricate challenges that cannot be understood by simply employing a simple tree diagram .
coming of age on the beaches of Southern California , I grew up in the middle of our nation &apos;s abortion wars .
listening and storytelling are the hallmarks of pro-voice practice .
so if we don &apos;t have these hel@@ per T cells , instead of healthy muscle , our muscle develops fat cells inside of it , and if there &apos;s fat in our muscle , it isn &apos;t as strong .
so on my way here , the passenger next to me and I had a very interesting conversation during my flight .
conservatives will call you a lot of colorful things .
that &apos;s what I thought .
diam@@ orph@@ ine is heroin .
( thunder ) Text : you can say a story is fabricated .
and when you touch it with your finger , you can actually , then , introduce all the forces on the face of that screen , and that actually has a certain amount of value .
now , that would be , if you will , the top green track , which doesn &apos;t mean too much . but you might have to elaborate for me or for somebody who isn &apos;t an expert , and say , &quot; Cook at 380 degrees for 45 minutes . &quot;
Nicholas Negroponte : now , this is his table of contents .
but teaching kids programming per se is utterly irrelevant .
and there are a number of schemes , which I don &apos;t want to dwell on , but this is the one that we finally used where we projected onto rear screen material that was molded in the face -- literally in the face of the person .
this is Carl .
Alec actually liked his eyes and asked if I was attracted to him , but I wasn &apos;t , and I don &apos;t think he was attracted to me either .
this means that you could have an insec@@ t-@@ of-the-@@ month calendar and not have to reuse a species for over 80,000 years .
( Laughter ) When they do have sex , even their sperm is more interesting than human sperm .
I think what that means is that people just couldn &apos;t see what was in front of them .
he knew before he arrived that the foundation was going to be live-@@ streaming his event , but what he didn &apos;t know until he turned up , was that they &apos;d er@@ ected a giant screen Twitter feed right next to his head .
she was a PR woman from New York with 170 Twitter followers , and she &apos;d Tweet little ac@@ er@@ bic jokes to them , like this one on a plane from New York to London : &#91; weird German Du@@ de : you &apos;re in first class . it &apos;s 2014 . get some de@@ odor@@ ant . &quot;
( Laughter ) Black silence when the Internet doesn &apos;t talk back .
I was making of fun of that bubble . &quot;
and of course , that &apos;s a much better thing to get people for than the things we used to get people for , like having children out of we@@ dlock .
let &apos;s not do that .
before even saying , &quot; Hello . &quot;
Thank you .
the most amazing thing about this imam is that he didn &apos;t ask me anything -- neither a sketch , or what I was going to write .
and because the YouTube page is set up so that the page in which I &apos;m talking to you is on the exact -- the place where I &apos;m talking to you is on the exact same page as your comments , you are participating in a live and real and active way in the conversation .
whatever perspective you take , it would seem pretty impossible for chemists to come in and build new parts that function within and alongside the natural molecules of life without somehow really screwing everything up .
just how special are the molecules of life ?
FR : my personal opinion is that if we found new life , we might not even recognize it .
( Laughter ) But also , I &apos;ve been meeting one-on-one with members and former members of the so-called Coalition of the W@@ illing , who assisted in the invasion .
I &apos;m a chimpanzee and you &apos;re a chimpanzee , and I want to cooperate with you .
I need to know you personally .
are you a nice chimpanzee ?
prisons are a system of cooperation ; slaugh@@ ter@@ houses are a system of cooperation ; concentration camps are a system of cooperation .
millions of people come together to build a cathedral or a mosque or fight in a crus@@ ade or a jihad , because they all believe in the same stories about God and heaven and hell .
BG : in the book , if I understand it correctly , you argue that the amazing breakthroughs that we are experiencing right now not only will potentially make our lives better , but they will create -- and I quote you -- ... &quot; new classes and new class struggles , just as the industrial revolution did . &quot;
another possibility is the division of humankind into different biological ca@@ stes , with the rich being upgraded into virtual gods , and the poor being degraded to this level of useless people .
( Laughter ) ... is when Abe , an Ar@@ yan , si@@ dled up next to me .

Florence Nigh@@ ting@@ ale invented the co@@ x@@ comb in 18@@ 57 for a presentation to Queen Victoria on troop mortality .
at last report , Atlanta &apos;s illegal sex trade has generated up to 2@@ 90 million dollars a year .

turns out , this is not a new problem .
these groups are hybrid .
I just show it because I want you to know I &apos;m concerned about context .
I couldn &apos;t deal with the success of furniture -- I wasn &apos;t secure enough as an architect -- and so I closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like .
P for P@@ all@@ adi@@ o .
the highlight of the performance was at the end .
but we were trying to collide our ideas , to put objects next to each other .
these Stone@@ hen@@ ge things were designed to give foreground and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot .
we &apos;re doing some work for him .
so it would all be built in stone , in French limestone , except for this metal piece .
it &apos;s like a drug addict .
and we studied many models .
I &apos;m making out with Brad Pitt , and Angel@@ ina is totally cool with it .
( Applause )
I had absolutely no idea what she meant .
but something incredible happened when we launched HeForShe .
now , eight months later , a movement is building .
so that &apos;s what it is about .
there are many types and degrees of stress and different kinds of memory , but we &apos;re going to focus on how short-term stress impacts your memory for facts .
completing practice questions under time pressure , or seated at a desk rather than on a couch , can make your stress response to these circumstances less sensitive during the test itself .
is this a person at an increased risk of developing an age-related disease ?
now , quantum biology isn &apos;t new ; it &apos;s been around since the early 1930s .
well , if you saw tracks like that you &apos;d guess it was some sort of stunt , of course .
to paraphrase a description in the book , he says : at the molecular level , living organisms have a certain order , a structure to them that &apos;s very different from the random thermody@@ namic j@@ os@@ tling of atoms and molecules in inanimate matter of the same complexity .
by creating capabilities within countries , we then create the ability for those countries to create epidemiological and laboratory networks which are capable of collecting and categor@@ izing these pathogens .
so these are the things that can be done , but to do this , if we want to deal with a complete market failure , we have to change the way we view and prevent infectious diseases .
is there a different way we can direct traffic ?
the copro@@ duction of public safety also means that officers need to understand the history and the power of their uniforms .
this is critical .
and in order for us to move forward together , with our family , our friends and for our health , we have to make sure that we focus this way .
you &apos;re talking about your bridges , your pipelines , your ports -- wiped out .
you &apos;re talking about a disaster where you can &apos;t fit a person or a dog -- and it &apos;s on fire .
so , to cut a long story short , we &apos;ve explored this alternative .
and while I was busy working -- I was working on these colliding worlds , in the day .
and we set ourselves a goal of turning the continent green .
and if you can imagine this tiny area , it &apos;s only one-@@ fif@@ ti@@ eth of the size of the full moon .
and in this process , many people will be less well-@@ off than their parents .
it takes being stupid to cooperate , then .
is it really in their personal interest to cooperate or not , if , when they cooperate , they are individually worse off ?
why would they cooperate ?
remove the interfaces , the middle offices -- all these complicated coordination structures .
since the revelations from Edward Snowden , there &apos;s been a huge increase in the number of people using various priv@@ ac@@ y-@@ enhancing tools .
neither entirely dark , nor entirely light .
and I didn &apos;t like that war , I thought it was stupid .
( Laughter ) CA : how about explaining this ?
JS : but not many . not many people .
today , those things in there called Cher@@ n-@@ Sim@@ ons invari@@ ants have spread through a lot of physics .
origins of life is a fascinating question .
so , in steady state , there are about two million stars in formation at any time .
CA : Jim , a couple of years ago , I got the chance to speak with Elon Musk , and I asked him the secret of his success , and he said taking physics seriously was it .
science creates ways of understanding .
and in the social sciences , the ways of understanding that get created are ways of understanding ourselves .
the requirement only goes in one direction .
and nowhere are the effects of bad design more heartbreaking or the opportunity for good design more compelling than at the end of life , where things are so distilled and concentrated .
it was a glorious , marvelous trip : freezing water , bli@@ stering dry heat , scorpions , snakes , wildlife ho@@ wling off the fl@@ aming walls of the Grand Canyon -- all the glorious side of the world beyond our control .
but the response that we had was clearly disproportionate -- disproportionate to the point of ver@@ ging on the un@@ h@@ inged .
and if we are treating the symptom and ignoring the bigger trend , then we &apos;ve got far bigger problems to deal with .
we passed the point last October when there were more mobile cellular devices , S@@ IM cards , out in the world than there were people .
on the security side , we &apos;ve come out of a Cold War in which it was too costly to fight a nuclear war , and so we didn &apos;t , to a period that I call Co@@ ol War , cyber war , where the costs of conflict are actually so low , that we may never stop .
( Applause ) Thanks , Pat .
so that was on my mind .
and that moment , I promised myself I &apos;d fight for equal rights and opportunities for boys and girls , men and women , the rest of my life .
so , I think you have to ask yourself -- I want people to be themselves , whatever that is , just let it be .
PM : and the first research the Leadership Initiative did showed that , that these examples you just used -- that many of us have the problem of being authentic .
so if you walk into a room , you see everybody represented .
it &apos;s a fact .
I was bus@@ sed to a school in the suburbs , from a neighborhood that many of my classmates and their parents considered dangerous .
but now , I own a home in a quickly gentri@@ fying neighborhood in Oakland , California .
they are full of people applying their savvy intelligence to stretch a minimum wage paycheck , or balance a job and a side hustle to make ends meet .
it all happened for me about 30 years ago when I was in graduate school , and a bunch of us graduate students got together one day , and we said , you know , there &apos;s an explosion of writing and thinking in feminist theory , but there &apos;s no courses yet .
and then it was my turn to speak , and I said , &quot; I have just one question for you guys , and it &apos;s about the title of the show , &apos; A Black Woman Sto@@ le My Jo@@ b . &apos; actually , it &apos;s about one word in the title .
and my position is that men need the very things that women have identified that they need to live the lives they say they want to live in order to live the lives that we say we want to live .
and we looked around and somebody else said , &quot; Well , you should sell supplies to the working bu@@ c@@ can@@ e@@ er . &quot; ( Laughter ) And so this is what we did . so it made everybody laugh , and we said , &quot; There &apos;s a point to that .
these are some signs that we have all over the place : &quot; practical Jo@@ king with P@@ ir@@ ates . &quot;
they &apos;re seeing adults . they &apos;re modeling their behavior .
and that &apos;s actually the br@@ unt of what we do is , people going straight from their workplace , straight from home , straight into the classroom and working directly with the students .
profound leaps forward !
I said no to every request for the two of us to do a media appearance together .
it &apos;s a very big change , and it means that obviously , industrialized countries must cut their emissions , must become much more energy-efficient , and must move as quickly as possible to renewable energy .
1945 was an extraordinary year .
the climate agreement -- a binding climate agreement -- is needed because of the scientific evidence that we &apos;re on a trajectory for about a four-@@ degree world and we have to change course to stay below two degrees .
and just as we &apos;ve been looking back this year -- in 2015 to 1945 , looking back 70 years -- I would like to think that they will look back , that world will look back 35 years from 2050 , 35 years to 2015 , and that they will say , &quot; Wer@@ en &apos;t they good to do what they did in 2015 ?
within two weeks , I was out of there , and I left with one intention : to find something that I could screw up . that &apos;s how tough it was .
and I notice other parents were watching too , and I swear they were thinking the same thing I was : this is why you don &apos;t let nine-@@ year-olds swim from Al@@ ca@@ tra@@ z .
because this is the group of people that inspires possibility .
and this isn &apos;t about being Gandhi or Steve Jobs , doing something crazy .
first , think of your daily rituals , whatever they may be : making your coffee , driving to work , harvesting your crops , saying your prayers .
in snow@@ y North America , ours were rituals of the global South .
&quot; students think that their environment is diverse if one comes from Missouri and another from Pakistan -- never mind that all of their parents are doctors or bankers . &quot;
now the majority of us aren &apos;t going to willingly go way down to a swamp .
we &apos;re a state that &apos;s surrounded and defined by water , and yet for centuries , swamps and wetlands have been regarded as these obstacles to overcome .
so you can imagine all else we have to learn about these landscapes if we just preserve them first .
Wei@@ d@@ mann was due to be executed at the crack of dawn , as was custom@@ ary at the time , but his execu@@ tion@@ er was new to the job , and he &apos;d underestimated how long it would take him to prepare .
today , the action takes place in a distant time and place , which gives the viewer a sense of det@@ achment from what &apos;s happening , a sense of separation .
it &apos;s already happened .
( Laughter ) Not a problem .
skip over all the pages reassuring religious people .
flat@@ tering , that .
whatever comes , there was this hour when nothing mattered , all was unbear@@ ably dear .
at that time , when I finished my high school , I really wanted to be a doctor .
you know what they said to me ?
eventually , I lost my ability to control my movements , make eye contact , and finally , my ability to speak .
your personality appears to vanish into a heavy fog and all of your emotions and desires are con@@ stric@@ ted , sti@@ fled and mu@@ ted within you .
but the years of constant care@@ taking , having to wake up every two hours to turn me , combined with them essentially grieving the loss of their son , had taken a toll on my mother and father .
and within a year , I was beginning to use a computer program to communicate .
some of it will be in our atmosphere for a century , maybe much longer .
and I &apos;m also rather surprised , because when I look back on my life the last thing I ever wanted to do was write , or be in any way involved in religion .
and I found some astonishing things in the course of my study that had never occurred to me . frankly , in the days when I thought I &apos;d had it with religion , I just found the whole thing absolutely incredible .
and everybody is shocked when the old man takes off his head covering and shows himself .
we understand less about the science of Alzheimer &apos;s than other diseases because we &apos;ve invested less time and money into researching it .

if our goal is to create a tiny number of billion-dollar companies , let &apos;s stick with venture capital , it &apos;s working .
the idea , though , of doing it together still seemed a little crazy .
and we have only just begun to imagine what democra@@ tizing access to capital will do .
this means that what we know of as space and time exist only as part of the universe and not beyond it .
a black hole is an object so dense that space and time around it are in@@ escap@@ ably modified , warped into an infinite sink .
the rest is chemical darkness .
and so what had happened , really , is that we found ourselves in a perceptual shift .
but perhaps what &apos;s really at stake are three more intangible M &apos;s : mechanisms , models , metaphors .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : I really like this metaphor .
and so small also means safe .
and in this particular case , you can essentially see there are some crops that are not doing as well as other crops .
he was haunted by the loss of his mother and his wife , who both died of tuberculosis at the age of 24 .
well , a lot of it was because of economic growth .
over 17 goals , there are then 16@@ 9 targets and literally hundreds of indicators .
and in there , I &apos;m now going to put all the countries of the world , each one represented by a dot , and on top of that I &apos;m going to put the regre@@ ssion line that shows the average relationship .
so here we are today , $ 14,000 per capita GDP .
well then , we get to nearly 73 , very close to the Global Goals .

world War II changed a lot of things , and one of them was this need to protect people from becoming victims of medical research without informed consent .
not to mention , at this time , there was a general assumption that men and women were alike in every way , apart from their reproductive organs and sex hormones .

so those little bits of RNA from the CRISPR lo@@ cus associate -- they bind -- to protein called Cas9 , which is white in the picture , and form a complex that functions like a sent@@ inel in the cell .
right now , the genetic information to understand what types of genes would give rise to these traits is mostly not known .
I think we all know that our happy place is meant to be somewhere natural , outdoors -- on a beach , fire@@ side .
I don &apos;t hate screens , but I don &apos;t feel -- and I don &apos;t think any of us feel that good about how much time we spend slou@@ ched over them .
well , I watch how people behave and respond to sound .
for example , a musical note cannot be fully captured and expressed on paper .
ASL is broken down into many different grammatical parameters .
the second one I &apos;d like to demonstrate is this -- please follow along with me again .
Bassem was a good swimmer , so he held her hand and tread water .
so on behalf of little Mas@@ a and on behalf of Doaa and of Bassem and of those 500 people who drowned with them , can we make sure that they did not die in vain ?

now , like poker , life is also a game of skill and luck , and when it comes to the biggest things we care about -- health , wealth and relationships -- these outcomes don &apos;t only depend on the quality of our decision-making , but also the roll of life &apos;s dice .
and an abyss like Kru@@ bera V@@ or@@ on@@ ya , which is in the Cauca@@ sus region , actually the deepest cave explored in the world , can go as far as more than 2,000 meters below the surface .
but soon , the quest for exploration brought me to the farthest corner of the planet , searching for new potential entran@@ ces of this undiscovered continent .
so we had to use special protocols to not contaminate the environment with our presence , and we tried also to share with the community , with the indigenous community , our discoveries .
there are still very unknown mountains , like Mar@@ ahu@@ aca , which is almost 3,000 meters high above sea level , or Ar@@ ac@@ à , which is in the upper region of Rio Negro in Brazil .
how do you take these pictures ?
chronic pain is an example . if you burn yourself , you pull your hand away .
this is not &quot; The Matrix . &quot; you can only do this to yourself . you take control .
but I want to leave with you the big question .
these are things to talk about and think about now , with your family and your loved ones .
( Applause )
we couldn &apos;t believe that something so horrific could happen to a human being , and that she would share it with us -- something so intimate , so personal .
it was sad to see an icon , a fun@@ ny@@ man , commit suicide , and there were three hour wait times on every phone hotline in the country .
the difference was if you text us , &quot; I want to die , &quot; or &quot; I want to kill myself , &quot; the algorithm reads that , you &apos;re code orange , and you become number one in the queue .
( Applause ) This data is also making the world better because I &apos;m sitting on the world &apos;s first map of real-time crises .

you know , sometimes it seems like all these problems of poverty , inequality , ill health , unemployment , violence , addiction -- they &apos;re right there in one person &apos;s life .
one of the policemen says to me , &quot; Look , I just deliver the message and then I leave . &quot;
so in a really brave step , the leaders of the city where Ella lives agreed that we could start by reversing Ryan &apos;s ratio .
so Ella and the mother asked everybody who came through the door , &quot; What will you do when my son starts kicking me ? &quot;
at the end of his life , in 1948 , Beveridge wrote a third report .
with an awareness of the depend@@ encies of these regulations , we can gain a new perspective .
let &apos;s look at an actual example .
this book is the final product , which I would eventually like to publish and translate into as many languages in the world , so that Arabic teaching and learning becomes fun , easy and accessible globally .
adults can weigh up to 300 kilos .
well , first , we need data .
this camera is equipped with a movement sensor and it photographs animals when they walk in front of it .
and this is where the solar cell and the LED come in .
of course the question is : can we receive very fast and subtle changes of the brightness , such as the ones transmitted by our LED lights ?
and It really doesn &apos;t matter where the beam hits the solar cell .
and last but not least , thirdly , inevitably , one student will raise her or his hand and say , &quot; With Google , I &apos;m certain to always get the best , unbiased search result . &quot;
and he prepared all three steps equally well .
and I say this because I believe we &apos;ve reached a point in time when it &apos;s absolutely imperative that we tie those bonds together again , tighter : the humanities and the technology .
don &apos;t get caught up in electronic music if you &apos;re doing physics . &quot;

I &apos;m walking across campus . cop comes and looks at me and says , &quot; You ! you &apos;re a student . &quot;
they would be the kind of person that I aspire to be .
sneaker@@ heads joke that as long as it &apos;s limited and Nike , they &apos;ll buy it .
it &apos;s no different than any other collec@@ tible market , only this isn &apos;t a market at all .
but what if that &apos;s not how we need to buy sneakers either ?
because if you had invested in a pair of Air Jordan 3 Black C@@ ement in 2011 , you could either be wearing them onstage , ( Laughter ) or have earned 16@@ 2 percent on your money -- double the S &amp; amp ; P and 20 percent more than Apple .
( voice-over ) Prote@@ sters : health care is a human right ! fight , fight , fight !
a Mass General Hospital study found that navigating patients to essential resources is associated with improvements in blood pressure and cholesterol levels similar to introducing a new drug , but without all the side effects .
she told us that she worked two jobs but still could not afford a membership to the Y , but it was OK that she couldn &apos;t go to the gym , she said , because she also could not afford gas and walked 10 miles to and from work every single day .
and the entire Earth doesn &apos;t have enough beaches to represent the stars in the overall universe .
in one such universe , you &apos;d graduate with honors and marry the person of your dreams .
I was the type and the kind of religious where kids kill themselves every single year because they &apos;re terrified of coming out to our community as gay .
why is that the assumption ?
we need to reclaim morality in a secular context that creates ethical scrutiny and accountability for religions all around the world , but we need to do it in a respectful way that breeds cooperation and not extremism .
you know , with the Black Pl@@ ague and all .
Samp@@ son : &quot; nay , as they dare , I will bite my thumb at them , which is a dis@@ grace to them , if they bear it . &quot;
Abraham : &quot; do you bite your thumb at us , sir ? &quot;
this dialogue gives us a good look at the characterization between these two characters .
OK , maybe you &apos;re saying , all right , well , we see brains , but what does that have to say about minds ?
we don &apos;t paint work cubic@@ les .
and to remember them , she thinks back to her days as a high school student , and the day she got a date for the dance .
Harriet was in high school , studying between classes .
that &apos;s the place in the enzyme where the reaction happens .
it enters the active site and then breaks off , leaving half of itself in there , totally blocking that channel and making it impossible for the ar@@ achi@@ don@@ ic acid to fit .
if we can understand it better , maybe we can help people manage it better .
most astro@@ biologists are trying to figure out if there &apos;s microbial life on Mars , or in the ocean under the frozen surface of Jupiter &apos;s moon Europa , or in the liquid hydro@@ carbon lakes that we &apos;ve found on Saturn &apos;s moon Titan .
and he says -- later he will say , &quot; I saw death .
for instance , if you let your sheep out of a pen to graze , you can keep track of how many went out by setting aside a stone for each one , and putting those stones back one by one when the sheep return , so you know if any are missing without really counting .
in 1900 , the great mathematician David Hil@@ bert listed the continuum hypothesis as the most important unsolved problem in mathematics .
for much of the past century , architecture was under the spell of a famous doctrine .
could it undo this hierarchy , and could it be about a system that is more about collaboration , rather than isolation ?
it both shows the enormous scale and potential of the project , but also the difference : here , it is a multiplicity of a hetero@@ geneous structure , in which different entities can interact without losing their own identity .
now the thing is that the amount of particles in even small samples is tremendous . for example , If you have a balloon of any gas at zero degrees Cel@@ cius , and at a pressure of one atmosphere , then you have precisely six hundred and two sex@@ til@@ lion gas particles .
that may seem round@@ about , but it &apos;s not .
metaphors can also live in verbs .
no one walks more than a quarter of a mile , and both vendors sell to half of the be@@ ach@@ go@@ ers .
when Teddy arrives , he sets up just south of you stealing all of the sou@@ ther@@ ly customers , and leaving you with a small group of people to the north .
however , you no longer have a socially optimal solution , since customers at either end of the beach have to walk further than necessary to get a sweet treat .

( breathing in ) ( Bre@@ a@@ thing out ) As you noticed , that last breath in is slow , deep and intense .
you can see what it looks like -- not pretty at all .
for swim@@ mers and athletes and also for us , free divers , it &apos;s a number everyone dreams of .
120 , 1@@ 23 meters .
it &apos;s caused by nitrogen dissolving in the blood , which causes confusion between the conscious and unconscious mind .
it brings back the sense of humility .
a journey into the deep is above all a group effort .
luckily , it &apos;s far from just that .
it cal@@ ms your mind .
holding your breath in the sea , not necessarily at 100 meters , but maybe at two or three , putting on your goggles , a pair of fli@@ ppers , means you can go see another world , another universe , completely magical .
these discoveries suggest that Earth-like planets may be only the tip of the astro@@ biological iceberg .

at : well , the story of climate change has been one that has been going on for quite a number of decades .
we have communities who already have been dis@@ located .
so this is what &apos;s happening , but when we talk about the rising sea level , we think it &apos;s something that happens gradually .
and so we made the sacrifice .
and so it &apos;s about them that we should be telling everybody , that it &apos;s not about their own national interest , because climate change , regre@@ tt@@ ably , unfortunately , is viewed by many countries as a national problem . it &apos;s not .
I am going to start with a challenge .
for example , here is what the Lord &apos;s Pra@@ yer looks like in Old English .
and what about the cor@@ dial reception ?
even if you never heard this history before , the memory of it persists in the feelings ev@@ oked by the words you speak .
but remember -- both are qualified .
as I met successful business people and read profiles of high-powered leaders , I noticed some commonality .
he did it , he succeeded .
there is no yellow light present at all .
having only one kind of light detector doesn &apos;t leave any room for seeing color .
there are instructions which say , &quot; I &apos;m an object .
and the men didn &apos;t rape me because it was just a normal opening , and it was all public , and they were with their wives .
so , heart beating and adrenaline is rushing and so on , is about trust , is about total trust to another human being .
and I removed the table and I &apos;m still sitting , and this changed everything .
I was watching these people , they would come and sit in front of me , but they would have to wait for hours and hours and hours to get to this position , and finally , they sit .
and this is how , for me , was born the idea to have an institute of im@@ material performing arts .
but it &apos;s six hours , the experience .
( Laughter ) This is orientation hall .
( Laughter ) And you know , sleeping is very important .
so in the parking lot you stay for a certain amount of time , and then after this you just , you know , go back , you see more of the things you like to see or go home with your certificate .
sometimes it behaves like a particle and other times it behaves like a wave , but it isn &apos;t exactly like either .
having spent my life reading almost exclusively British and North American books , I had no idea how to go about sourcing and finding stories and choosing them from much of the rest of the world .
these days , when I look at my book@@ shelves or consider the works on my e-@@ reader , they tell a rather different story .
we built our entire business around it .
your match percentage with B is based on questions you &apos;ve both answered .
that 94 percent is your match percentage with B .
so now the f@@ usions of technologies are ready to help me see the real world .
we &apos;ll also draw some gri@@ d@@ lines to help us along .
so , here &apos;s your answer .
never mind that this is what you &apos;ll actually produce if you attempt to work at a computer with a baby on your lap .
I thought , there &apos;s just something wrong with me that I can &apos;t swing this . &quot;
America has a message for new mothers who work and for their babies .
she wouldn &apos;t take a bottle .
we pass them on anyway .
not one more fragile infant should have to go directly from the incubator to day care because his parents have used up all of their me@@ ager time sitting in the NI@@ C@@ U .

in Mendel &apos;s first generation , the yellow homo@@ zy@@ gous pea mom will give each pea kid a yel@@ low-@@ dominant allele , and the green homo@@ zy@@ gous pea dad will give a green-@@ rec@@ essive allele .
but , with engineering and ingenuity , the Vietnamese expanded and improved the trail .
as usual in these things , these two lines are , in fact , parallel , but you perceive them to bow outwards at their centers .
that &apos;s what this stimulus means .
but the only way your brain can do that , is that it has to , instead of generating a perception of the way the world was when light hit your retina , it has to do something fanci@@ er .
what will the world look like in a tenth of a second ?
this one &apos;s fun .
and here you see one embryo dividing , alongside 14 eggs that didn &apos;t fertilize and will blow up .
many mathematicians over the centuries tried to prove the parallel postulate from the other four , but weren &apos;t able to do so .
these discoveries could never have been made without gifted , progressive thinkers able to suspend their preconceived notions and think outside of what they &apos;ve been taught .
the founding fathers knew that they did not want to establish another country that was ruled by a king , so the discussions were centered on having a strong and fair national government that protected individual freedoms and did not abuse its power .
let &apos;s start with a square that has area of one meter .
I immediately wrote to the Society and requested my personal copy of the poster , which to this day still hangs in my office .
it could be hard to imagine how this could have happened .
in order to orchestrate these interconnected resources with their diverse technologies , we developed a computing grid , enabling the seamless sharing of computing resources around the globe .
but how do I actually transform energy into matter ?
consider , for example , the electron .
it &apos;s anti@@ particle , the posit@@ ron , has exactly the same mass , but a positive electric charge .
Domitia I has met another ten year old also dec@@ ked out in the in@@ sign@@ ia of be@@ tro@@ thal .

for example , they inserted the genes , or instructions , for a cell to create firefly lucifer@@ ase and lucifer@@ in into a tobacco plant .
but is it correct ?
for that one pair of people , we then increment n by 2 .
and so , by this algorithm &apos;s end , n is 2 , which indeed matches the number of people in the room .
indeed this algorithm is said to be bu@@ ggy because it has a mistake .
all of the technology that we perfected during World War II -- sonar , lightweight polymers -- all these things were re@@ directed towards fish .
the other thing that &apos;s going on here is a phenomenon that the filmmaker Mark Benjamin called &quot; G@@ rin@@ ding Nemo . &quot;
aquaculture is the fastest growing food system on the planet .
it &apos;s actually a tremendously sustainable solution , it goes from an egg to an adult in nine months .

sometimes the sun does shoot flares at Earth , but the magnetic fields surrounding our planet blocks most of that radiation .
you &apos;re watching snippets from &quot; Sputnik , &quot; my fifth documentary feature , which is just about completed .
a man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens , it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space .
within a year , Congress funded huge weapons increases , and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000 .
but each one of these is a different age , and if we can find out how old they are and then we can measure those chemical signals , this helps us to find out what &apos;s been going on in the ocean in the past .
sharing the same root with anesthesia , meaning no sensation , synesthesia means joined sensation .
and so with this solution , what does this mean for the world ?
he believed that the sun was at the center of the universe .

so why don &apos;t you give them a little history -- just a tickle -- a bit of history of where it comes from .
as of 2012 , the world record for fastest short-@@ distance sprint speed is roughly 27 miles per hour .
a child on the ground can easily outrun Michael P@@ helps in water , but why is that ?
what if someone accidentally spills sc@@ olding hot coffee on you ?
but that means that retinas in your eyes are not catching the light , either .
so , how does orbiting work ?
for one thing , evolutionary fitness is just a matter of how well-@@ suited they are to their current environment .
they first thought about making a car@@ avan park , but the council said no .
and they &apos;ll weigh up the advantages and the disadvantages and they &apos;ll make a decision .
so actually , if you want to go and make your own mini-@@ cemetery , then you can .
as if that weren &apos;t enough , pi is used in particle physics experiments , such as those using the Large Hadron Collider , not only due to its round shape , but more subtly , because of the orbits in which tiny particles move .
this can be difficult for those with dyslexia .
there are a lot of ways this marvelous language of ours , English , doesn &apos;t make sense .
old English people had t@@ oun@@ gen instead of tongues , nam@@ en instead of names , and if things stayed the way they were , today we would have ey@@ en instead of eyes .
imagine running up against a language with eg@@ gr@@ u and g@@ at on the one hand , and then with other words , all you have to do is add &apos; s &apos; and get days and stones .
LT : when we knew we would be here today you sent me a lot of books about women , female friendships , and I was so surprised to see how many books , how much research has been done recently -- JF : and were you grateful ? LT : I was grateful .
LT : but men are so in@@ cul@@ cated in the culture to be comfortable in the patriarchy .
very , very mild -- JF : right .
Thank you both .
LT : Thank you .
gardening , it seems , is not just for greenhouses .
because honestly , it &apos;s really not easy .
( Laughter ) But in the end , the results always blow my mind .
I think we all share a fear that we don &apos;t protect our oceans enough .
we call them sacred , and we do our best to cherish them , to protect them and to keep them safe .
and it &apos;s really hard to think of something that &apos;s just so plain and so enormous , as fragile .
it wasn &apos;t very effective , but , at the end of the war , both the U.S. and U.S.@@ S.@@ R. had captured the technology and the scientists that had developed it and began using them for their own projects .
not wanting to fall too far behind , President Eisenhower ordered the Navy to speed up its own project and launch a satellite as soon as possible .
two major superpowers trying to out@@ do each other by pursuing symbolic projects that were both dangerous and expensive , using resources that could have been better spent elsewhere ?
the water in the ocean beneath it is warmer than the frozen ground in the Antarctic , and that warmth is transferred through the ice pack .
both of our polar regions are very important climate controllers .
as sea ice in the Arctic declines due to climate change and global warming , weather around the globe becomes increasing more unstable .
imagine a new kind of assass@@ in , one that could perpetr@@ ate a crime without firing a single shot or even being in the same country .
one was Einstein &apos;s theory of relativity , the other was arguably even more revolutionary : quantum mechanics , a mind-@@ mel@@ tingly strange yet stun@@ ningly successful new way of understanding the micro@@ world , the world of atoms and particles .
this is the essential problem : the universe is far , far too interesting .
now , if you followed the news at the time , you &apos;ll have seen a lot of physicists getting very excited indeed , and you &apos;d be forgiven for thinking we get that way every time we discover a new particle .
if you &apos;ve ever held a magnet close to a piece of metal and felt a force pulling across that gap , then you &apos;ve felt the effect of a field .
some of the greatest minds in history - Aristotle , Ptole@@ my , Da Vinci , Dec@@ ar@@ tes - have all wrestled with this problem and failed to generate an adequate explanation .
AG : well , I think , basically , what triggered this huge increase was the Syrian refugee group .
BG : we &apos;ll come back to that too , but you mentioned the cutting of funding and the vou@@ chers from the World Food Program@@ me .
now that the world seems to have woken up , are you getting more funding and more support , or it &apos;s still the same ?
would you trust someone who just won the lottery to accurately define the concept of currency ?
and your love for your partner may be in its own dynamic relationship , healthy or totally weird , with the love of your parents and siblings .
but then sometimes , slowly or suddenly , you don &apos;t .
second , growth will need to happen in a way that does not damage the land that provides us with the goods and services that support the human population .
even though they seem different , the warmth you feel from a crack@@ ling fire is the same as the sun shining on you on a beautiful day , the same as ultraviolet light you put on sunscreen to protect yourself from , the same thing as your TV , your radio , and your microwave .
when you think of the night sky , you probably think of being able to see the stars shining with your own eyes , but that &apos;s just visible light , which you now know is only a tiny part of the full spectrum .
but many microbes do swim , and this is where those incredible adaptations come in .
and while Bur@@ han was the youngest recruit , he was not alone .
what things like that show us is that there is a fundamental inability today on the part of governments to adapt and learn in digital conflict , where conflict can be im@@ material , border@@ less , often wholly un@@ trac@@ eable .
we see online radicalization of teens , who can then be deployed globally for offline terrorist attacks .

we call this negatively curved or open .
but smell , because it evolved before most of your other senses , takes a direct route to these different regions of the brain , where it can trigger your fight-or-flight response , help you recall memories , or make your mouth water .
for some people , the chemical and@@ ros@@ ten@@ one smells like vanilla ; to others , it smells like sweaty urine , which is unfortunate because and@@ ros@@ ten@@ one is commonly found in tasty things like pork .

because the small number of signals have thousands of possible paths by which to distribute themselves .
it &apos;s actually just an average show , actually -- literally , in fact , because the average of this curve here is at 7.@@ 4 , and &quot; Alpha House &quot; lands at 7.5 , so a slightly above average show , but certainly not what Roy Pri@@ ce and his team were aiming for .
now , the question of course is , what happened here ?
I mean , if you &apos;re collecting millions of data points on a decision you &apos;re going to make , then you should be able to make a pretty good decision .
many objects &apos; center of mass are outside their bodies .

say we have four people trying to sit in four numbered chairs .
so exciting that mathematicians have chosen to symbo@@ lize this kind of calculation , known as a factorial , with an exclamation mark .
in our simple example , the number of ways four people can be arranged into chairs is written as four factorial , which equals 24 .

we said , &quot; This is your community table .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s a great arm -- protection !
but somehow , we went back to business as usual .
we would also need a comparison group of people who do not have exposure to the ingredient .
men prefer females with high-pitched , brea@@ thy voices , and wide formant spacing , correlated with smaller body size .
when used in every day life , the word symmetry represents vague notions of beauty , harmony and balance .
many other animals , foxes , sharks , beetles , that butterfly we mentioned earlier , have this kind of symmetry , as do some plants like orchid flowers .
for biologists , this is strong evidence that we &apos;re more closely related to starfish than we are , to say , corals , or other animals that don &apos;t exhibit bilateral symmetry at any stage in their development .
welcome to Bay@@ e@@ ku , a river@@ ine community in I@@ k@@ or@@ od@@ u , Lagos -- a vivid representation of several river@@ ine communities across Nigeria , communities whose waterways have been infested by an invasive aquatic weed ; communities where economic livelihoods have been ham@@ pered : fishing , marine transportation and trading ; communities where fish yields have diminished ; communities where school@@ children are unable to go to school for days , sometimes weeks , on end .
and so I thought , &quot; This could be easily deployed within the communities without the requirement of technical skills . &quot;
and so I began my quest to find out how I can learn how to weave .
and the community is predominantly made up of people from the northern part of the country .

the amount of information just a click away may be limitless , but the time and energy we have to absorb and evaluate it is not .
and when we can understand our human connections with our groundwater and all of our water resources on this planet , then we &apos;ll be working on the problem that &apos;s probably the most important issue of this century .
every atom and molecule has a set number of possible energy levels for its electrons .
but as tools have become more and more complex , we need more complex controls to control them .
and you can also manipulate and collaborate on 3D data sets as well , so you can gesture around them as well as manipulate them .
and so the problem with having 900 of something is that you have to do every step 900 times .
how do we move forward from here ?
so , in conclusion , I really think that we need to think about a new , fundamentally different way of interacting with computers .
better contrast means it &apos;s easier to see the edge of something .
dreams feel real .

the justice was wearing black and Sandy wrote , &#91; Her face and hands stood out like in an old , mostly dark painting . &#93; now , unlike with the hurricane , with this &quot; like , &quot; the author didn &apos;t have the excuse of describing hurricane damage .
I asked , through the editor , if the author would consider changing it to &quot; All in the vicinity held their breath , &quot; because &quot; all &quot; is plural .
( Laughter ) Thank you .
how does the news shape the way we see the world ?
so , if you put it all together , this could help explain why today &apos;s college graduates , as well as less educated Americans , know less about the world than their counterparts did 20 years ago .
who remembers Copenhagen ?
well , once you have all of this in place and you have shifted this understanding , then you see that governments were able to go to Paris and adopt the Paris agreement .

secret .
I think you all must be aware of it , but I &apos;ll still list it for the few who don &apos;t .
after all , they have grown up accepting such restrictions as norms .
dear parents , if you would be ashamed of periods , your daughters would be , too .
now , if you want to find dinosaurs , don &apos;t look in the Pale@@ ozoic , you won &apos;t find them .
so that &apos;s my formula for finding dinosaurs , and I &apos;ve applied it all around the world .
now , to grow so large , an animal like Dreadnoughtus would &apos;ve had to have been a model of efficiency .
it &apos;s important , therefore , to test your talk on trusted friends , and find out which parts they get confused by .
and because Jenipher doesn &apos;t have collateral or a credit history , she can &apos;t walk into a bank and ask for a business loan .
and the data shows a six percent increase in rep@@ ay@@ ment among customers who are consistent with where they spend most of their time .
these are just some of the thousands of different data points that we look at to understand a person &apos;s cred@@ it@@ worthiness .
( cello music ) ( Music ends ) On the flight here , I was reminded about my mom .
I was there , too , with a film crew .
I have obse@@ ssi@@ ve-@@ compulsive disorder .
and Times Square in New York is literally the crossroads of the world .
these communities who don &apos;t want their stories to be told , I never looked to them as stories or numbers .
will we do whatever it takes to tackle climate change ?
so what could we do with 300 other pay-@@ for-@@ performance climate projects like that , organized on a global scale ?
32 million heart attacks and strokes occur .
all friends of Africa , that will have reason to be in Africa at some point in time , should be very concerned about this de@@ pl@@ orable situation .
20 percent are getting treated .
that is totally wrong . those of you in the audience here , if you want to help Africa , invest money in sustainable development .
very soon we will all be dead and gone , but the problems will stay , unless we have people taking over from where we stopped .
we get the generators from the companies .
this model can be adapted to every disease process .
the patient doesn &apos;t have to travel .
we encourage them to bring children .
that way we &apos;re not going to deal with ob@@ so@@ lesc@@ ence and all those kinds of issues .
we &apos;re also starting an@@ c@@ illary health-care technology training programs -- training people in echo@@ cardi@@ ography , cardiac ultrasound , those kinds of things . now , with that kind of training , it gives people motivation .
I am going . those who want to come , I welcome you to come along with me .
I was doing physics , I was coming back home and I realized that I actually always knew a 3D printer .
BMI is fairly connected to your lifestyle , but we still can , we get in the ball@@ park , eight kilograms of precision .
but there is another point .
we invented pacemakers and X-ray , and we even came into this wonderful new era of cell and gene therapies .
Dr. Co@@ vin@@ sky , a clinical researcher at the University of California , he conclu@@ des that a third of patients over 70 and more than half of patients over 85 , leave the hospital more disabled than when they came in .
a friend of mine , Art , he recently needed to be hospitalized for just a minor surgery , and he had to stay in the hospital for over two weeks , just because he needed a specific kind of IV antibiotics .
and a large portion of these costs are driven by investments in large , shiny hospital buildings .
so we see a delivery driver deliver the medicine to the patient &apos;s home .
he radicalized the Bau@@ haus Design School in 1920s Germany , and yet some of his former colleagues sh@@ un@@ ned him when he struggled to open a new Bau@@ haus in Chicago years later .
and I &apos;m going to finish by looking at just a few of them .
20 years ago , a biologist named Anthony James got obsessed with the idea of making mosquitos that didn &apos;t transmit malaria .
you can take an entire gene out , put one in , or even edit just a single letter within a gene .
now , let &apos;s take all this information together and ask : how can we use it to transmit a memory that I have from my brain to your brains ?
this starts to tell you about the mechanism by which we can tell stories and transmit information .
but maybe one way to do it is to go back to the more natural way of communication , which is a dialogue , in which it &apos;s not only me speaking to you now , but a more natural way of talking , in which I am speaking and I am listening , and together we are trying to come to a common ground and new ideas .
the authenticity and origin of them is completely de@@ bat@@ able , but people believe these to be imbu@@ ed with power , or even magic .
and what can we gain by the right to marry if we are not able to cross the ac@@ ri@@ mony and emotional distance that so often separates us from our love ?
and we don &apos;t set the bar much higher than stability when it comes to our emotional life .
as a physician , I wonder whether we could use it to reduce the number of lives lost due to one of the fastest-growing diseases on Earth : cancer .
let me tell you about how miniaturization might get us there .
right now I &apos;m standing in the open air , on a beach under a palm tree , in the exact spot where your stage used to be .
the average human lifespan is now 4@@ 32 years , and my work has been to extend the human lifespan indefinitely .
the day we met , we were passing each other in Az@@ ad@@ i Square , and we bumped shoulders .
so many different points of resonance that it &apos;s going to be difficult to bring them all up , but I &apos;ll try to do my best .
and they &apos;re also trying to develop all of their software tools completely open-source .
and I think that this is an extraordinarily interesting area because there is tremendous area under this long tail in publishing .
you can click on every single equation and bring up a little tool to be able to experiment with it , tinker with it , understand it .
because we really don &apos;t understand until we do .
( Laughter ) OK , the second big enab@@ ler , and this is where I told a big lie .
and we would be accused of &#91; piracy &#93; for doing that , because this music has been proper@@ tized .
so , thanks very much .
and I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had , and that is that , you know , I had expectations placed on me .
and after that , my mother believed that it was fate , or cur@@ ses -- she went looking through all the reasons in the universe why this would have happened .
and the one my mother asked : how do I make things happen ?
because , after all , in that framework , between page one and 300 , you have to answer this question of why things happen , how things happen , in what order they happen . what are the influences ?
and it may also be explained that now you have a focus .
I was thinking that I shouldn &apos;t go because somebody said , if I did , it would show that I approved of the military regime there .
another chance encounter is when I went to a place -- I just was with some friends , and we drove randomly to a different place , and we ended up in this non-@@ tourist location , a beautiful village , pristine .
and I also can find that by imagining fully , and becoming what is imagined -- and yet is in that real world , the fictional world .
there she is .
but not just simple simulations -- we would also create advanced simulations with top universities like MIT , to bring out cutting-edge cancer research to these students .
and what they found was a surprisingly high 76 percent increase in the learning effectiveness when using virtual laboratories over traditional teaching methods .
no , not this Pin@@ oc@@ chi@@ o effect .
yeah , I know .
people have actually been working on this for decades .
words were said to me that I never thought I would ever hear it said to my face by another human being .
because , you know , we have this culture inferi@@ ority , which means that anything that comes from us is not good enough .
but you know , in my situation , and because I was raised to criticize by creating , it &apos;s Michelangel@@ os .
because the distribu@@ tors are not going to come here to start their business , because it makes no sense , either .
I want the calm , productive way .
everything I was looking at seemed like it was going to kill me , but I couldn &apos;t explain why .
it takes a few weeks , a few months .
around 10 percent of the US military is actively engaged in combat , 10 percent or under .
most people don &apos;t realize that the majority of those suicides are veterans of the Vietnam War , that generation , and their decision to take their own lives actually might not be related to the war they fought 50 years earlier .
the reason is that if you trauma@@ tize an entire society , we don &apos;t fall apart and turn on one another .
this is Mary .
Kathe Sw@@ anson is a retired city clerk from the city of Di@@ xon .
and what Peter noticed was , the participants in this study were not given the penicillin to treat their syphilis .
and so Peter thought this was completely unfair and he tried to report again , and finally talked to a reporter -- very similar to Mary .
one hundred died from syphilis complications , forty wives were infected and 10 children were born with con@@ genital syphilis .
every month my wages would just replenish my over@@ draft .
I &apos;ve experienced exploitation and violence at work .
decrimin@@ alization means the removal of laws that puni@@ tively target the sex industry , instead treating sex work much like any other kind of work .

and there are exactly 6 cubes left , each with 4 empty faces .
you know , the force responsible for electricity and magnetic attraction and so forth .
there didn &apos;t seem to be anything else to warp or curve .
it took so long to get these ants to do this .
and there you see unification , because matter particles , electrons and quarks , radiation particles , photons , gravit@@ ons , are all built up from one entity .
how would we know it ?
Einstein comes along and says , well , space and time can warp and curve -- that &apos;s what gravity is .
so for instance , you want the words &quot; dog &quot; and &quot; cat &quot; to be very close together , but the words &quot; grapefruit &quot; and &quot; logarith@@ m &quot; to be very far away .
carbon@@ ated beverages can similarly bubble up in the stomach , forcing open the valve .
historically , the barbershop has been a safe haven for black men .
for that reason , it &apos;s one of the few places where we can fear@@ lessly be ourselves and just ... talk .

this precision approach to a public health problem has cut by nearly half HIV transmission from mothers to baby in the last five years .
you buy the Declaration of Independence and give it back to the people .
let me put it this way -- when I came back from the war , she showed me the letters that I had written her from overseas , and they were absolute love letters .
every letter started , &quot; My dear@@ est , darling Mr. President , &quot; and he &apos;d tell him something wonderful about what he did .
the same resource that humanity is supposed to have wars over during the next 50 years .
here &apos;s another example .
and with small , growing piles , we &apos;ll keep the record of how many times each site has been visited by these digital marbles .
then a few hours later , waking up and go , &quot; Ah , it &apos;s time to get the kids to school -- &quot; What is this ?
and after we completed our huge analysis of the Land@@ au damp@@ ing , I was lucky enough to get the most coveted Fields Med@@ al from the hands of the President of India , in Hyderabad on 19 August , 2010 -- an honor that mathematicians never dare to dream , a day that I will remember until I live .
there &apos;s a lot of information here .
one of the curators told me , &quot; A@@ mit , what would it be like if you could create a virtual curator &apos;s table where all these six million objects are displayed in a way for us to look at the connections between them ? &quot;

so overall , this is amazing news .
they lack access to these things .
they were won by people who fought for them and who sacrificed for them .
let &apos;s start with the fact that many drugs don &apos;t work for those who are prescribed them .
now , adverse drug reactions and side effects are often tied to challenges in dosing .
we can measure so much of our physiology and behaviors today , and often it &apos;s si@@ lo@@ ed on our phones and scales , but it &apos;s starting to connect to our clinicians , our caregivers , so they can better optimize prevention , diagnostics and therapy .
I &apos;m wearing a small , Band-@@ A@@ id-@@ sized patch , that is live-@@ streaming my vital signs right now .
except this time , it holds the messages so that Nancy can still focus , but John can get the thought off of his mind .
and they subtract from those positive hours the amount of time people spent on the website , because that &apos;s a cost to people &apos;s lives .
I &apos;ve tried a number of things , and nothing seems to work .
so in this way , whatever we designed , we were actually able to implement it across all 15,000 schools from day one .
I &apos;m using the word &quot; consciousness &quot; as a feeling of reality that we get from our senses experiencing the world around us .

and from these kinds of serial electron microscopy slices , one can start to make reconstructions in 3D of neurons that look like these .
you just say , let &apos;s play a little algebra trick , and move the six over to the right-hand side of the equation .

basically , if companies cannot find a place for this item quickly and economically , its place becomes the trash .
so they launched a big investigation , and their suspic@@ ions quickly conver@@ ged on this man , Alfred Dreyfus .
this just convinced them more that Dreyfus was not only guilty , but snea@@ ky as well , because clearly he had hidden all of the evidence before they had managed to get to it .
this was called the De@@ gra@@ dation of Dreyfus .
and vice versa : if you don &apos;t support capital punishment , same thing .

the types of microbes that they used were called hydro@@ genot@@ ro@@ phs , and with these hydro@@ genot@@ ro@@ phs , you can create a virtuous carbon cycle that would sustain life onboard a spacecraft .
astronauts would breathe out carbon dioxide , that carbon dioxide would then be captured by the microbes and converted into a nutritious , carbon-@@ rich crop .
on a long space journey , you simply wouldn &apos;t be able to pick up any carbon along the way , so you &apos;d have to figure out how to recycle it on board .
and we made an oil that &apos;s similar to palm oil .
the merchants who had st@@ alls in the old city market now trade out of sheds on the streets .
but I believe there is one key reason that has been overlooked and which is important to analyze , because from it will largely depend whether we can make sure that this doesn &apos;t happen again .
I am British .
I am still a global citizen .
two hundred years of modern science .
take , for example , sequ@@ oia trees .
yet it &apos;s made of sugar .
and the common feature about all these materials is that they need no one .
it attracts a lot of biodiversity .
our habitat stopped being our natural habitat .
when it &apos;s cold , frost formation happens only on the mul@@ ch , so soil can still breathe while it &apos;s freezing outside .
Thank you very much .
&quot; mom , who are these people ? &quot;
as a result , I would like to think that we poor , oppressed women actually have some useful , certainly hard-@@ earned lessons to share , lessons that might turn out useful for anyone wishing to thrive in the modern world .
as for the Arab woman , our society still assumes that her primary source of happiness should be the happiness and prosperity of her children and husband .
here &apos;s another confession : I have found that our daughter is actually more successful at teaching him these skills than I am .
but there are things we can do that machines can &apos;t do .
imagine that you are a product designer .
but one of the things that exposed me early to learning , and a tremendous curiosity that was in@@ stilled in me as a child , was through a technology which is on the screen -- is a Vic@@ tro@@ la .
and in today &apos;s world , being useful , affordable and accessible is not necessarily what happens in a lot of the technology that is done today .
I had the opportunity to have a discussion with President M@@ be@@ ki , and one of the things that we talked about is , what is it that &apos;s keeping this connectivity goal from moving ahead faster ?
one example of this has been the One Laptop per Child .
and so I think that nature is not that which is untouched by humanity , man or woman .
well , it &apos;s this kind of miracle .
and they &apos;re also putting out beetle repell@@ ent in key areas as I saw last time I went hiking there .
climate change is among them .
I started turning it over in my head , and I realized , &quot; Wait a minute -- my head actually fits inside this thing . &quot;
they change them to be the characters they want to be in those produc@@ tions .
and the costumes are how we reveal ourselves to each other .
we decided to do something that was the very opposite of everything we &apos;d been taught to do as journalists : share .
he pasted tar@@ ps over the windows of his home to prevent pr@@ ying eyes during the long Icelandic winter .
now , it was a big risk , and it wouldn &apos;t work for every story , but we showed with the Panama Papers that you can write about any country from just about anywhere , and then choose your preferred battle@@ ground to defend your work .
all new technology comes with trade-offs .
the only thing that would not burn in the fire was a green avoca@@ do branch .
for centuries , indigenous women told stories by weaving complex patterns on lo@@ oms , and an unexpected skill helped us for the new device .
maybe we could try to pinpoint the exact changes in the brain that result in diseases , diseases like Alzheimer &apos;s and epilepsy and Parkinson &apos;s , for which there are few treatments , much less cures , and for which , very often , we don &apos;t know the cause or the origins and what &apos;s really causing them to occur .
now , our group at MIT is trying to take a different point of view from the way neuroscience has been done over the last hundred years .
this is very good because we could potentially move everything apart in the brain .
we can build drugs that bind those .
but in medicine , we don &apos;t necessarily have all the laws .
like fire and unlike the other kinds of matter , plas@@ mas don &apos;t exist in a stable state on earth .
for example , my first presentation at the company .

and I still need allies , too .
this really matters to people , so if you don &apos;t know , just ask .
the extent of the clear-@@ cutting was alarming , and I soon found myself conflicted by my part in it .
so even though they &apos;re in a desert , they get their own personal oasis .
but not so .
so we &apos;re not solving it .
where I live in Portland , Oregon , I can &apos;t take Echo for a swim during the rainy season , because we dump raw sewage sometimes into our river .

we took data from over 20,000 employees around the world , and we found the answer was simple : respect .
those that felt respected were healthier , more focused , more likely to stay with their organization and far more engaged .
when my friend Doug Con@@ ant took over as CEO of Campbell &apos;s Sou@@ p Company in 2001 , the company &apos;s market share had just dropped in half .
and as Doug drove up to work his first day , he noticed that the headquarters was surrounded by barb@@ wire fence .
it had been growing at five percent per annum for the last one and a half decades , but this year &apos;s forecast was three percent . why ?
corruption is an issue that we have not yet gotten a good enough handle on , and we have to fight tooth and nail , that and increased transparency in the way we manage our economies and the way we manage our finances .
and finally , the issue of education .
they don &apos;t know whether and how to invest .

I did notice in Ste@@ phen@@ ville , Texas , that the town square was dominated by one lawyer &apos;s office after another , because of all the people rotating in and out of the prison .
it &apos;s a fantastic achievement , and yet , it hides a paradox , which is that nearly 70 percent of all our energy consumption is oil .

for women under the age of 30 , that number looks like one in 10 .
it &apos;s a law that regulates digital material and content .
and they compete : the first miner to find out the truth and to validate the block , is rewarded in digital currency , in the case of the Bitcoin blockchain , with Bitcoin .
so the Bitcoin blockchain is just one .
my view is that ...
and this is a wonderful thing , because it can also help us protect our privacy , and privacy is the foundation of a free society .
you want to make a ring@@ tone ? that &apos;s different .
they have no semantic meaning .
&quot; strangers communicate better than spouses ! &quot;
so how is it possible that we communicate so well with strangers ?
we tell the whole story , we explain who the people are , how we feel about them ; we spell out all the inside jokes .
now , here &apos;s the really interesting part .
as Santiago Cre@@ el , an opposition senator , put it to me , &quot; Look , I &apos;m not saying that I &apos;m special or that anyone is special , but that group , that was special . &quot;

women have been part of the most influential movements coming out of the Middle East , but they tend to be invisible to the international community .
this period , though , was also marked by widespread nonviolent organizing in the forms of strikes , sit@@ -ins and the creation of parallel institutions .
the next morning , we &apos;ll review the homework , then another lecture , homework , lecture , homework .
so the idea of mastery learning is to do the exact opposite .
instead of artificially constra@@ ining , fixing when and how long you work on something , pretty much ensuring that variable outcome , the A , B , C , D , F -- do it the other way around .
you should have grit ; you should have perseverance ; you should take agency over your learning .
it would have to be personalized , you &apos;d have to have private tu@@ tors and work@@ sheets for every student .

and start asking them , &quot; How do you want to be when you grow up ? &quot;
so don &apos;t do that .
however , the amount of motion you see in the brain in this video is probably not right at all .
Announcer : cou@@ g@@ ars bring extra people late , but L@@ uck has time , and Win@@ slow is crushed .
now , this device is only limited in such that it can measure the skull motion , but what we really want to know is what &apos;s happening inside of the brain .
and so this is a simulation using the data from our mouth@@ guard from the injury I just showed you , and what you see is the brain -- this is a cross-section right in the front of the brain twisting and cont@@ orting as I mentioned .
they have an industry body , which is the way most industries work .
and so with our over@@ help , our over@@ protection and over@@ direction and hand-@@ holding , we deprive our kids of the chance to build self-@@ efficacy , which is a really fundamental ten@@ et of the human psyche , far more important than that self-esteem they get every time we applaud .
and then we have to say , &quot; How was your day ?
now , you might wonder , &quot; Come on , how much could five percentage points of global electricity be ? &quot;
there was a study , a survey done of people around the world , not just in the United States or Europe , about a year and a half ago .
what we found is that the world is actually at risk of losing four times more clean energy than we lost over the last 10 years .
a lot of people , and this includes everybody from philosophers and economists to ordinary people believe that human nature is fundamentally selfish , that we &apos;re only ever really motivated by our own welfare .
answering this question requires exploring the roots of extraordinary acts of altruism , and what might make people who engage in such acts different than other people .
so all of these findings are reliable and robust , and they &apos;re very interesting .
they are better at recognizing other people &apos;s fear .
and I don &apos;t know exactly why this is , but I think it may be that we now just know so much more about the suffering of strangers in distant places , and so we now care a lot more about the suffering of those distant strangers .
don &apos;t answer that out loud .
are you underpaid ?
so I show up in classes and I conduct observations to give feedback , because I want my teachers to be just as successful as the name Mot@@ t Hall Bri@@ dges Academy .

I asked him , &quot; How many wives would you like to have ? &quot;
they evolved over 4.@@ 4 million years ago among our first ancestors , and they &apos;re not going to change if you swipe left or right on Tinder .
it &apos;s associated with the concept of paradox of choice .
and I stumbled , then , on a statistic that really came home to me .
( Laughter ) And in an age where we have too many choices , we have very little fear of pregnancy and disease and we &apos;ve got no feeling of shame for sex before marriage , I think people are taking their time to love .
it was very low until around about 1850 , and then the rate of population growth began to rise so that around the time I was born , when we first saw those images from the moon of our planet , our global population was growing at two percent a year .
but then , if you look at the end of the graph , the growth began to slow .
there are many , many things to be frightened about , but there is no need for us to fear each other as much as we do , and we need to see that we are now living in a new world .
I mean , given how valuable intelligence and automation are , we will continue to improve our technology if we are at all able to .
we have already built narrow intelligence into our machines , and many of these machines perform at a level of superhuman intelligence already .
the other thing that &apos;s worrying , frankly , is that , imagine the best case scenario .
when you &apos;re talking about superintelligent AI that can make changes to itself , it seems that we only have one chance to get the initial conditions right , and even then we will need to absorb the economic and political consequences of getting them right .
lots of scientists did a lot of work to make CRISPR happen , and what &apos;s interesting to me is that these scientists are being supported by our society .

and it &apos;s a little scary .
before I had time to process what was happening , a hand was cl@@ apped around my mouth so that I could not breathe , and the young man behind me dragged me to the ground , beat my head repeatedly against the pavement until my face began to bleed , kicking me in the back and neck while he began to assault me , ripping off my clothes and telling me to &quot; shut up , &quot; as I struggled to cry for help .
what I never anticipated is that almost overnight , this published letter would go viral .
the voices of those directly affected were at the forefront of the story -- not the voices of journalists or comment@@ ators on social media .
as if I &apos;m going to be like , &quot; Hey guys ! sorry I can &apos;t make it , I &apos;m busy trying to hate the entire male population by the time I &apos;m 30 . &quot;
in the courtroom , he went up to the South African Ru@@ g@@ by Union &apos;s lawyers , shook them by the hand and conver@@ sed with them , each in their own language .
and when we create noise on social media , let it not drown out the needs of those affected , but instead let it amplify their voices , so the internet becomes a place where you &apos;re not the exception if you speak out about something that has actually happened to you .
and one of them came up and offered to show me around .
many nights , he told me , he actually slept in his tri@@ shaw so he could catch the first visitors off the all-@@ night train .

and finally he extracted a box .
I had been spending 20 years in classrooms collecting facts , and I was actually in the information business , writing articles for Time Magazine .
in the end , perhaps , being human is much more important than being fully in the know .
you &apos;ll notice that there aren &apos;t that many things that have changed .

she even took a class with me in New York City .
by 14 , I knew I really wanted to be an artist .

I would get a bad reputation , and you would refuse to do business with me in the future .
it &apos;s widely talked about how trust in institutions and many corporate brands has been steadily declining and continues to do so .
it &apos;s the trust shift it creates , and for my part , I want to help people understand this new era of trust so that we can get it right and we can embrace the opportunities to redesign systems that are more transparent , inclusive and accountable .

survey research by Pew Research shows that the degree to which we feel that the other side is not just -- we don &apos;t just dislike them ; we strongly dislike them , and we think that they are a threat to the nation .

I &apos;ve come up with this new mantra after coming back from a three-@@ month sabbatical , which is rare for black women to take who are in leadership , but I felt it was really important for my leadership and for my team to also practice stepping back as well as also sometimes stepping in .
OT : that &apos;s right .
we didn &apos;t wait any prerequis@@ ite amount of time for our courtship ; we told each other the vulnerable truths up front : I am a transgender man , which means the F on my birth certificate should have stood for &quot; Fal@@ se , &quot; instead of &quot; Fe@@ male . &quot;
and queer is a cultural term , but in this case , it refers to the way that I &apos;m not restricted by gender when it comes to choosing partners .

in 1987 , Tina Lord found herself in quite the pickle .
when you believe that there is a way around or through whatever is in front of you , that surrender is not an option , you can overcome enormous obstacles .
I was unemployed and living on the second floor of my in-@@ laws &apos; home , and that &apos;s enough to make anyone feel dead inside .

( Laughter ) I think they &apos;re still there .
the doughnut maker took me so seriously .
( Laughter ) But had I left after the initial rejection , I would &apos;ve thought , well , it &apos;s because the guy didn &apos;t trust me , it &apos;s because I was crazy , because I didn &apos;t dress up well , I didn &apos;t look good .
and he trusted me enough to offer me a referral , using a sales term .
so for example , one day I went to a Starbucks , and asked the manager , &quot; Hey , can I be a Starbucks gre@@ eter ? &quot;

and while we often take for granted the services that satellites provide us , the satellites themselves deserve our attention as they are leaving a lasting mark on the space they occupy .
satellites there are naturally buff@@ eted by Earth &apos;s atmosphere , so their orbits naturally decay , and they &apos;ll eventually burn up , probably within a couple of decades .
here &apos;s the reason , or not the reason , but here &apos;s why I ask that question .
it is not a map .

could we merge ?
it was my blood , her blood , our blood .
sperm donors are often referred to as &quot; biological fathers , &quot; but should we really be using the word &quot; father ? &quot;
but today , I will talk to you about what I learned from talking to parents and children .
in this treatment timeline , you can see two points at which we conducted interviews .
and they explained .
they , above all , wanted to do what &apos;s best for their child .
so when they thought about the counselor and the advice they were given , we discussed that .
and that &apos;s the strange thing about advice .
and finally , believe in your abilities and your creativity , because you can do it yourself .
maybe you remember .
it seemed like humanity was spinning out of control .
it &apos;s not all about me .
we even now have a religious ritual , a posture , that holds the paradox between power@@ lessness and power .
that was really the &quot; what &quot; of science .
but a year and a half later her boy nonetheless died of his cancer .
I can guarantee you , she and her husband did not crack another bottle of champagne after talking to me .
they can think in the same way , but they may have a different arrangement , and maybe they &apos;re higher in some cases than humans , like long-term memory in a squirrel is actually phenomenal , so it can remember where it buried its nuts .
so we &apos;re going to take these things , these artificial clusters , and we &apos;ll be adding more varieties of artificial cognition to our AIs .
and we actually might even come to advertise these as &quot; consci@@ ous@@ ne@@ ss@@ -free . &quot;
and there actually may be some problems that are so difficult in business and science that our own type of human thinking may not be able to solve them alone .
the most popular AI product in 20 years from now , that everybody uses , has not been invented yet .
but it wasn &apos;t simple .

I had them keep track of their time for a week so I could add up how much they worked and slept , and I interviewed them about their strategies , for my book .
one medical report actually says they were &quot; dancing in the halls . &quot;
one in four of all adults in the United States suffers from mental illness , which means that if you haven &apos;t experienced it personally or someone in your family hasn &apos;t , it &apos;s still very likely that someone you know has , though they may not talk about it .
and in both the case of the tuberculosis ward and the anti@@ hi@@ st@@ amine , someone had to be able to recognize that a drug that was designed to do one thing -- treat tuberculosis or suppress allergies -- could be used to do something very different -- treat depression .
and it looked kind of like this .
this is also a drama@@ tization , in case that &apos;s not clear .
it will be social .
and every time someone ran it , they confirmed the same thing .
regardless , the idea itself is completely novel in psychiatry , to use drugs to prevent mental illness as opposed to just treat it .
tell her she was born just in time , just in time to lead .
they called it , &quot; Meg@@ atons to Me@@ ga@@ watts . &quot;
that &apos;s not what &apos;s going to be driving them .
it &apos;s going to be ideology or the chase for a profit .
so why should we be concerned about this ?
and in fact , we can just go back one century to the last century to see the power that eugenics can have .
but when we are going about hacking the human code , I think all bets are off in terms of what might come of that .
then there &apos;s another kind of taker that we won &apos;t be addressing today , and that &apos;s called a psychopath .
if you run an organization , we can actually make this easier .
there &apos;s a personality trait that throws us off .
and the books would say , yeah , we understand a lot about these two realms separately , but when we try to link them mathematically , everything breaks .
we took a first look at the LHC for any new , big , obvi@@ ous@@ -to-@@ spot particles , and we can report that there are none .
( Laughter ) Here &apos;s the broader point .
they can &apos;t be done by machines , but they still need to be done .
farming is only one example .
automation , employment , robots and jobs -- it &apos;ll all take care of itself ?
on numerous occasions in the last 200 years , scholars and activists have raised the alarm that we are running out of work and making ourselves obsolete : for example , the Lu@@ dd@@ ites in the early 1800s ; US Secretary of Labor James Davis in the mid-@@ 1920s ; Nobel Prize-@@ winning economist W@@ assi@@ ly Leon@@ ti@@ ef in 1982 ; and of course , many scholars , pundits , technologists and media figures today .
also , we see that it &apos;s the &quot; red planet , &quot; and atmospheric escape plays a role in Mars being red .
so one way we actually can learn about the future is by planets so far away that we can &apos;t see .
and for most of these people -- 98 percent according to some studies -- most of these people will never speak up and tell their employer .

I know that &apos;s an absurd notion .
it &apos;s like this ultimate toolkit .
and as those devices get smaller , they get faster , they consume less power and they get cheaper .
it would be slow , you couldn &apos;t put any of your stuff on it , you could possibly get through the first two minutes of a &quot; Wal@@ king Dead &quot; episode if you &apos;re lucky -- ( Laughter ) The point is the progress -- it &apos;s not gradual .
yet we know this progress may not last forever .
what are we not doing that needs to be done ? &quot;
what are we not doing , but needs to be done to make this a success ? &quot;
I think on some level I wanted to feel a little bit crazy , because I thought that that was how love worked .
( Laughter ) And then our culture uses language to shape and reinforce these ideas about love .

the added tragedy of Ban@@ az &apos;s story is that she had gone to the police in England five times asking for help , telling them that she was going to be killed by her family .
just like Ban@@ az , I found that these young men were torn apart from trying to bridge the gaps between their families and the countries that they were born in .
they make the powerless feel powerful .

it &apos;s the talk that I would have given if I had been famous first .
it &apos;s not uncommon to hear people say that stories make the world a better place .
so three -- because it &apos;s always got to be three -- three reasons why I think that stories don &apos;t necessarily make the world a better place .

law enforcement must be empowered with up@@ -to-@@ date internet technology , the devices and an understanding of these platforms -- how they work .
in New York recently , the law could not be applied to a perpetrator because the crimes must have been committed -- even if it was anonymous -- they must have been committed by telephone , in mail , by telegraph -- ( Laughter ) The language must be technologically neutral .
and as I believe that human interaction is at the core of our healing , trauma not transformed will be trauma transferred .
I explore the weight , density and smell , but most importantly , I think a lot about the stories we attach to different kinds of air .
this year , over two billion records lost or stolen .
you start the process of issuing a wire transfer , and up in your browser would pop a screen from your bank , indicating that there &apos;s a problem with your account , and that you need to call the bank immediately , along with the number to the bank &apos;s fraud department .
we know this because our security researchers see repeated spikes of malware on a Friday afternoon .
so , here is an example .
and to date , over 4,000 organizations are leveraging this data , including half of the Fortune 100 .
it certainly seems like a disaster .
it was just a comparison group so we could get a baseline .
and what we found when we surveyed people about their environmental attitudes afterwards , we found that liberals , it didn &apos;t matter what essay they read .
there are 12 pairs of 50 : 1 reductions , so that means that the final speed of that gear on the end is so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once .
the balconies are mis@@ registered .
look at two weeks ago , a small company called S@@ ki@@ p winning over Uber and Ly@@ ft and everyone to actually get the license for the San Francisco scooter business .
so the rise of one and the reaction of the other create a toxic cocktail of pride , arrogance , paranoia , that drug them both to war .
where we &apos;re moving from things that are constructed to that which is grown .
Thank you all so much .
then in 2010 , a Nazi began to har@@ ass me .
( Laughter ) &quot; So it &apos;s pure win-win situation for you . &quot;
I recognized that feeling .
and I have discovered that the people I visit are just as afraid of people they don &apos;t know as I was afraid of them before I started inviting myself for coffee .
they all believe that other people have to stop demon@@ izing .
again , you can &apos;t really see much .
( Laughter ) So , let &apos;s have a look again .
thus , we are at a tipping point .
I thought the lo@@ oters had stolen everything .
and then one day , this appeared .
we found this incredible false door , mostly intact .
he handed me a check for $ 2,000 , and said , &quot; This is to cover your expenses .
but the only way we &apos;re going to be able to write it is if we do it together .
Thank you .
( Applause )
and rather like numeracy , this is not just an English problem .
there are seven questions .
we &apos;ve had online applications that allow you to put in a post code and get statistics back for years .
they ri@@ fled through my backpack .
yeah . so have I .
and he told me that it took the guards over five minutes to respond , and when they came , the man was unconscious .
and at this point , they &apos;re pre@@ trial de@@ tain@@ ees , not criminals .
not in sterile policy terms like &quot; mass incarceration , &quot; or &quot; sentencing of nonviolent offenders , &quot; but in human terms .
and so she sleeps .
we started this terminology because we needed a way to talk to each other .
because people have different preferences for the words they use .
what time is it on Mars ?
they got up 40 minutes later every day .
and we did actually start calling ourselves Marti@@ ans .
we wouldn &apos;t be designing better cities for children .
I mean , there must be a reason the voting age is 18 .
I struggled a bit with the initial period of home@@ sickness .
the word &quot; rape &quot; didn &apos;t echo around my mind as it should &apos;ve , and I wasn &apos;t cruci@@ fying myself with memories of the night before .
deep down , I knew I &apos;d done something im@@ measurably wrong .
but on that occasion , I chose to draw upon the negative ones .
the learning zone is when our goal is to improve .
and since courts at the time were very noisy , he also practiced by the ocean , projecting his voice above the roar of the waves .
she identifies opportunities for improvement , for herself , her dancers and her camera staff .
we get a lot of donated equipment .
it &apos;s emotionally draining and , for many , financially destructive .
the problem is that many cancer diagnostic tools are invasive , costly , often in@@ accurate and they can take an agonizing amount of time to get the results back .
an automated system for rapidly sorting these important biomarkers is not currently available .
it is my hope and dream to help people around the world avoid the high costs -- physical , financial and emotional -- faced by today &apos;s cancer patients , hardships that I &apos;m well acqua@@ inted with .
and even this map of Manhattan is a bit misleading because the red color is uses that are mixed vertically .
and I want to thank Alex Mac@@ lean , the aerial photographer , for many of these beautiful pictures that I &apos;m showing you today .
and the ratio of the size of the parking lot to the size of the school tells you all you need to know , which is that no child has ever walked to this school , no child will ever walk to this school .
when I was young , I had one soccer field , one baseball diamond and one tennis court , but I could walk to it , because it was in my neighborhood .
but we have to understand it &apos;s a two-@@ part American dream .
but where you build it , they come .
they move slower when trees are next to the road , and , of course , sometimes they slow down very quickly .
in 2011 , I was a first-year PhD student in the University of Manchester School of Psy@@ cho@@ logical Sciences .
how would I cope ?
I wasn &apos;t quite sure what exactly I wanted to do .
she listened carefully and patiently , and then to my joy she said , &quot; If that &apos;s what you want to do , and it means so much to you , then let &apos;s do it .
to have that in Manchester would be a huge achievement , let alone in a conflict zone in Syria -- really highlighting how important these kinds of messages were to families .
the families had left hundreds of messages -- most incredibly positive and encouraging .
we &apos;re told , never share anything you wouldn &apos;t want the entire world to see .
Harvard Professor Dr. David Williams , the person who pioneered the tools that have proven these lin@@ kages , says that the more marginalized groups in our society experience more discrimination and more impacts on their health .
I became interested in maternal health when a failed pre@@ med trajectory instead sent me down a path looking for other ways to help pregnant people .
I am an industri@@ ous optimist .
in fact , all social institutions have disappeared .
but what is surprising and somewhat dis@@ ma@@ ying , is how little impact this insight has had , in terms of how we think about human suffering and war .
in other words , I needed to build something very much like a HAL but without the homici@@ dal tendencies .
he had no concept of the idea of an algorithm , but that &apos;s what he described in that book , and this is what we now know as the evolutionary algorithm .
so , he took the Greek word &quot; mi@@ meme , &quot; which means that which is im@@ itated .
you probably went out and bought them .
it &apos;s not surprising that you all found it when you arrived in your bathrooms here .
all other theories explaining the big brain , and language , and tool use and all these things that make us unique , are based upon genes .
as the memes evolve , as they inevitably must , they drive a bigger brain that is better at copying the memes that are doing the driving .
language is a parasite that we &apos;ve adapted to , not something that was there originally for our genes , on this view .
and indeed , in the short time I &apos;ve already been at TED , I see we &apos;re even closer than I thought we were before .
they &apos;re both of our making -- this is man interacting with the environment and doing some rather unpleasant things .
on the right there you see the basking shark .
but we can &apos;t force the microbes and they generate a small amount of electricity per second .
so , why not make something like this ?
there we go . I &apos;ve got a packet -- and I &apos;ve got a le@@ mon@@ -@@ flavored one .
we have a black president .
I woke up this morning in a bad mood and decided to kick them off the Internet . &quot;
on this network , the sites get downloaded directly from other visitors .
my other motivation to create this network was worry .
if you can precisely divide the square into fifths you &apos;ll have just enough antidote for everyone .
pause the video now if you want to figure it out for yourself .
if we cut BF and DH we &apos;d get four@@ ths , but we need fifths .
this approach , the phone@@ tic approach , which says we have to write words as we pronounce them , both is and isn &apos;t at the root of spelling as we practice it today .
here , in this intimate group of 10,000 , I &apos;d like to bring to the table some changes that I find reasonable to start discussing .
say you want to make a peanut butter banana smoo@@ thi@@ e and you turn on a blender .
now we &apos;re ready for step four : figuring out how to move forward .
the recordings of the child , her friends and family , can be used for targeted advertising .
now , I would like to tell you a story about love .
and others try to read everything , but that &apos;s , again , impossible .
fundamentally , it &apos;s triage .
and my first reaction , that I can &apos;t actually say here , but will describe it as fear , the idea of surveying people about their scripts was certainly not a novel or a genius one .
like many of you , I &apos;ve lost too many friends and family to this disease .
today in the United States , only one in nine people get care and treatment for their disorder .
and together , we can be part of a growing movement in the United States to change how we view people with addiction .
together we can change public policy .
each year , my research team exam@@ ines the top 100 gros@@ sing films in the United States .
so the challenge for the SDGs is to try and sweep all these dots across to the right , to 100 by 2030 .
let &apos;s start with our top-@@ performing country , Denmark .
see Bangladesh in the middle .
so that &apos;s an area we could do better .
they aren &apos;t .
humans think in stories , and we try to make sense of the world by telling stories .
CA : so some , I guess many liberals out there view Trump and his government as kind of ir@@ rede@@ ema@@ bly bad , just awful in every way .
do you see any underlying narrative or political philosophy in there that is at least worth understanding ?
so let &apos;s go back 2,000 years backwards .
I don &apos;t think this can work , but a lot of people , this is their gut instinct .
the only way to have regulations , effective regulations , on things like genetic engineering , is to have global regulations .
similarly , with health care , let &apos;s say that in 20 , 30 , 40 years , you &apos;ll have expensive treatments that can extend human life to 120 , I don &apos;t know .
Jonathan Ha@@ idt : thanks , Yuval .
we look at people within the United States who have been recruited by ISIS .
so it &apos;s not just a problem , say , for a global vision .
you have religions , you have nations that sometimes demand exclusive loyalty , but it &apos;s not the only option .
and that that &apos;s actually sparked a lot of the anger .
now , when people say there will be new jobs in the future , that humans can do better than AI , that humans can do better than robots , they usually think about high-@@ skill jobs , like software engineers designing virtual worlds .
another thing that I would emphasize is that anybody who is really interested in global governance should always make it very , very clear that it doesn &apos;t replace or abolish local identities and communities , that it should come both as -- It should be part of a single package .
CA : putting all the pieces together here -- the current politics , the coming technology , concerns like the one you &apos;ve just outlined -- I mean , it seems like you yourself are in quite a bleak place when you think about the future .
the problem is , we have very little margin for error .
( Laughter ) Professor K@@ eller was curious about many things : why teap@@ ots dri@@ bble or how earthworms wri@@ ggle .
he went on hi@@ kes with his parents .
all of us wore pink bo@@ as for the occasion , and Crystal , as you can see , queen for a day , wore a spar@@ kly ti@@ ara .
( Laughter ) I said that seemed a bit high for one cookie .
it &apos;s an icon of water itself , and it elevates people &apos;s perception of contemporary design .
biop@@ oly@@ mers , these new ideas for materials , will come into play in probably a decade .
( Laughter ) Actually , I put marijuana in everything I cooked -- ( Laughter ) And I had access to all the best girls . it was fabulous .
all the guys in the rugby team couldn &apos;t understand .
these interrelated forms , they do inspire everything I do , although I might end up making something incredibly simple .
this is an idea for a gas@@ -@@ injected , one-@@ piece polymer chair .
it contributes immensely to our -- sense of being , our sense of relationships with things , our sensuality and , you know , the sort of -- even the sort of socio-@@ erotic side , which is very important .
you see that thing . you do . you do .
this is the stere@@ o@@ lith@@ ography of a staircase .
I built this thing for my studio .
as China buys all these crappy cars , we should be riding things like this .
I &apos;m a conta@@ minator for all those children of investment bankers -- wan@@ kers .
we know these international standards work because we &apos;ve already got one .
they worked out they were worth two billion pounds .
and so I realized we had to go through the business of building an informed citizen@@ ry .
it was this guest house , it had kind of been di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated , not taken care of for a long time .
it is not a ghost .
it &apos;s symbo@@ lically important to me , and that metaphor is so meaningful , so purposeful to me , and I &apos;m not going to try to persuade you of it , &quot; now you &apos;ve moved it from outer truth to inner truth , from science to art .
and there was an objective reality in my haunted house , right ?
and also , please have a carbon mono@@ xide detector in your home .
how had the other come to such outrageous conclusions about the world ?
and just as I learned to do , we routinely refuse to acknowledge the flaws in our positions or the merits in our opponent &apos;s .
my friends on Twitter realized that even when my words were aggressive and offensive , I sincerely believed I was doing the right thing .
that we should be guided by that most basic fact , and approach one another with generosity and compassion .
this is the message that we absorb as kids , and this is the message that fully perme@@ ates as we grow up .
and I know what you &apos;re thinking .
so notice next time you say , &quot; Watch out , you &apos;re going to get hurt , &quot; or , &quot; Don &apos;t do that , it &apos;s dangerous . &quot;
in her book , &quot; We@@ ap@@ ons of M@@ ath De@@ struc@@ tion , &quot; data scientist C@@ athy O &apos;@@ Neil talks about the rising new W@@ M@@ Ds -- widespread , mysterious and destructive algorithms that are increasingly being used to make decisions that impact more aspects of our lives .
so we really have to think about these decisions .
and I turn to Caroline , and she &apos;s crying her eyes out .
we have to find a way of stopping young girls and women feeling not only that their story doesn &apos;t matter , but they &apos;re not allowed to be the storyteller .
and if we could imagine it , then we would have the energy and the stamina to work towards it .
finally , the industry will beauti@@ fy the corpse .
they &apos;ll inject dyes so the person looks a little more alive -- just resting .
you wouldn &apos;t stand for it .
I have to tell you , as a parent myself , that hit me hard , because I know , had I not del@@ ved into that research , I would have talked to my own child about contraception , about disease protection , about consent because I &apos;m a modern parent , and I would have thought ...
job well done .
I &apos;m German myself , so I know exactly what that feels like .
and you may be familiar with the movie &quot; Con@@ t@@ act , &quot; which sort of popularized that .
( Laughter ) I think Paul Simon is in the audience , and he has -- he may not realize it , but he wrote a song all about whale sex , &quot; S@@ lip@@ -@@ Sli@@ din &apos; A@@ way . &quot;
that &apos;s called a baby@@ gram , a full X-ray of a child &apos;s body , a little infant &apos;s body .
I do not believe you can walk in someone else &apos;s shoes , and because of that , we must adopt a new way of giving of ourselves .
( Laughter ) The malls that are still open , they always do this weird thing -- like the dead malls .
this is a nice shot of the whole thing here .
( Laughter ) Now , what parallel universe do you suppose I live in ?
and some of them do much more than answer .
so suggestions , please , not right now , but send me an email if you &apos;ve got an idea about what we can do with this amazing team of glorious losers .
so I think maybe those people , the glorious loser &apos;s club , could travel around the world wherever there &apos;s an election and remind people of the necessity in our modern age of thinking a little bit outwards and thinking of the international consequences .
it &apos;s my simple diagnosis of what &apos;s wrong with the world and how we can fix it .
Thank you .
I want to give you another example .
why ?
Gre@@ t@@ chen Carl@@ son : there are a lot of reasons , in my mind , why it happened .
so it &apos;s fascinating that people who loved what his message was during the campaign , I &apos;m not sure -- how do you think they &apos;ll react to that ?
and maybe that leads to a certain amount of chaos and confusion , but -- GC : I actually don &apos;t think he &apos;s listening to a wide range of voices .
DB : yeah , and we &apos;re trying to build bridges here , and especially for an audience that may have contempt for Trump , it &apos;s important to say , no , this is a real thing .
people hate what government has become and how it &apos;s left them out .
we organize parties , and those parties are big , diverse , messy coalitions , and we engage in politics , and politics is always morally un@@ satisfying because it &apos;s always a bunch of compromises .
CA : so you would say this is a trap that liberals have fallen into by celebrating causes they really believe in , often expressed through the language of &quot; political correctness . &quot;
so to me , it &apos;s : how is the conservative media going to respond to it ?
the conservative media used to be Fox or Charles Kra@@ u@@ th@@ am@@ mer or George Will .
Ya@@ el Eisen@@ st@@ at : I &apos;ll speak into the box .
the problem with populism is the same problem with eli@@ tism .
I think if you only watch certain entities , you have no idea what the rest of the world is talking about .
now 51 percent do it .
that seems to me to become the fertile conversation of the future : how do we rebuild communities in this modern age , with technology doing what it &apos;s doing , and reimagine this bright future ?
because I discovered that my coffee would not be possible without hundreds of people I take for granted .
is this a pyramid scheme , what do you want , what are you selling ? &quot;
this is a total disaster .
so we kept trying and failing and trying and failing .
some got killed , and some did it without drug assistance .
they put me in the car , then they drove me around Palo Alto .
but the point is , this is the same situation that can inf@@ lame the hostile imagination in some of us , that makes us perpetrators of evil , can inspire the heroic imagination in others .
it &apos;s the same situation and you &apos;re on one side or the other .
because it may only happen once in your life , and when you pass it by , you &apos;ll always know , I could have been a hero and I let it pass me by .
the animals that were li@@ cked and gro@@ omed heavily , the high-@@ licking and grooming , are not stressed .
so how can this work ?
the same preparation that was supposed to protect us from hunger and famine is going to cause obesity , cardiovascular problems and metabolic disease .
we can now compare the monkey that had a mother or not .
but how can you study this in humans ?
one of the hardest natural disasters in Canadian history happened in my province of Que@@ bec .
so if we can program genes , if we are not just the slaves of the history of our genes , that they could be programmed , can we de@@ program them ?
their genes are re-@@ marked in a different way , and when the cue comes , their genome is ready to develop this addictive phenot@@ ype .
one layer of information is old , evolved from millions of years of evolution .
it was Jonathan S@@ wi@@ ft who once said , &quot; Vision is the art of seeing the invisible . &quot;
if all the mass around us is pulling on us all the time , how would Earth &apos;s gravity change if you tun@@ neled deep below the surface , assuming you could do so without being cooked or crushed ?
however , as you can imagine , building a single-@@ dish telescope the size of the Earth is impossible .
OK , we get a simil@@ ar-@@ looking image .
research has found that higher levels of discrimination are associated with an elevated risk of a broad range of diseases from blood pressure to abdominal obesity to breast cancer to heart disease and even premature mortality .
we may be simply viewing a normal American who is reflecting what he has been exposed to as a result of being raised in this society .
in a different context , but to a very similar point , a peculiar challenge was presented to my team by this woman .
the very positive response of its thousands of users taught me a very important lesson -- that working with data means designing ways to transform the abstract and the un@@ coun@@ table into something that can be seen , felt and directly re@@ connected to our lives and to our behaviors , something that is hard to achieve if we let the obsession for the numbers and the technology around them lead us in the process .
so I want to go through those three ways of thinking .
but I ask you , when you ask yourself that now or tonight or behind a steering wheel or in the boardroom or the situation room : push past the long@@ path , quick , oh , what &apos;s my long@@ path the next three years or five years ?
what we do is basically treat him like a baby , in the sense that we &apos;re going to place one pad in the center of the chest and one in the back .
it means things happen .
and the fourth and most important , of course , was the del@@ ine@@ ation of a contem@@ pla@@ tive practice that not only had the possibility of a transformation of the human heart , but had 2,500 years of empirical evidence that such a transformation was a certainty .
so , literally two weeks ago , I returned from having spent six weeks with the El@@ der Brothers on what was clearly the most extraordinary trip of my life .
and I said , &quot; Dan@@ il@@ o , you won &apos;t remember this , but when you were an infant , I carried you on my back , up and down the mountains . &quot;
now , I want to stress that none of these peoples that I &apos;ve been quickly talking about here are disappearing worlds .
right now , as we sit here in this room , of those 6,000 languages spoken the day that you were born , fully half aren &apos;t being taught to children .
imagine similarly two airlines were to say , &quot; Look , Air@@ line A , we &apos;ll take the route from LA to Chicago , &quot; and Air@@ line B says , &quot; We &apos;ll take the route from Chicago to DC , and we won &apos;t compete . &quot;
is it because women are born with a cooking gene ?
and when I looked up the word in the dictionary that day , this is what it said : &quot; feminist : a person who believes in the social , political and economic equality of the sexes . &quot;
players expect their video games to offer them branching narrative so that every decision that they make feels important and can change the outcome of the game .
we &apos;d all prefer to win , but when you discover that you can &apos;t win , what do you value instead ?
otherwise , I &apos;m limited in my journey .
well , we do see something interesting .
but the view is very different .
it &apos;s at the same frequency as my survey , but it &apos;s so faint .
understandably , they weren &apos;t too happy with our line of questioning , and let &apos;s just say we received our fair share of &quot; alternative facts . &quot;
( Laughter ) In@@ flu@@ ential Nigerians were telling us at the time that we were naïve , we didn &apos;t understand the political situation in Nigeria .
this is a still from the video that Boko Haram filmed as a proof of life , and through a source , I obtained this video .

brilliant , no doubt , yet somehow cut off from the world , shows little emotion -- kind of like Spock from &quot; Star Trek , &quot; you know ?
my mission in life is to help us disagree productively .
the suspic@@ ions that you hold about people who esp@@ ouse beliefs that you don &apos;t have , starts to evaporate .
it has precedent .
once you start thinking about what it would take to change your mind , you start to wonder why you were quite so sure in the first place .
speak up if you &apos;re struggling .
I &apos;m going to illustrate it with some fairly concrete examples , but always pointing to the broader themes .
some people get less dressed up .
young and old , dancing in the streets .
the classic answer is to form an institution , right ?
and journalists are in the street r@@ all@@ ying to improve the shield laws .
but it turns out that the logic of the support group is value neutral .
50 years in which loosely coordinated groups are going to be given increasingly high leverage , and the more those groups fore@@ go traditional institutional imper@@ atives -- like deciding in advance what &apos;s going to happen , or the profit motive -- the more leverage they &apos;ll get .
Thank you very much .
that phrase turned me into an eye-@@ contact coach .
so I dedicated myself to working with him on those things , so we would have more and more eye-@@ contact moments .
but it wasn &apos;t just Ivan &apos;s eye contact that mattered .
I was illiterate .
I was just reading stuff !
it &apos;s an epidemic and a bigger danger to public safety than any other issue .
( Applause ) A professional is a person who knows his craft better than most , and nobody knows how much money you need , have or want better than you , which means you are the professional .
and so I believed it , too .
she spoke of a patient -- a Native American patient that she had -- that wanted to bring a bunch of feathers into the ICU .
and as we tried to make the right decisions and follow my mother &apos;s wishes , we found that we were depending upon the guidance of nurses .
people hire me because they have consequences that they really intend , and what they intend is for me to help them achieve those consequences .
so instead they tried to figure out what one room they could go into in each of these buildings , in as many buildings that they could , and fix that one room so that they could improve the lives of the children inside as they were studying .
( Laughter ) I really loved this idea , and I somehow was not focused on the idea that librarians as a class are sort of interested in spelling and I don &apos;t know .
and I &apos;d say , &quot; Well , I &apos;m part of the team that designed this place . &quot;
Hey , wait a second , do you want to see how I turn off the lights ? &quot;
the unintended consequence here , which I would like to take credit for and like to think I can think through the experience to that extent , but I can &apos;t .
I could have very well ended up among today &apos;s &quot; discarded &quot; people .
hope is the door that opens onto the future .
if the total amount of currency in circulation increases faster than the total value of goods and services in the economy , then each individual piece will be able to buy a smaller portion of those things than before .
but defl@@ ation would make people want to hold onto their money , and a decrease in consumer spending would reduce business profits , leading to more unemployment and a further decrease in spending , causing the economy to keep shrinking .
so most economists believe that while too much of either is dangerous , a small , consistent amount of inflation is necessary to encourage economic growth .
do you understand power ?

this consolidation occurs with the help of a major part of the brain , known as the hippocampus .
it was only after his later general theory of relativity was confirmed in 1919 by measuring the bending of starlight during a solar eclipse that the press would turn him into a celebrity .

this deliberate irony is an example of dou@@ ble@@ speak , when words are used not to convey meaning but to undermine it , corrup@@ ting the very ideas they refer to .
Orwell urged us to protect our language because ultimately our ability to think and communicate clearly is what stands between us and a world where war is peace and freedom is slavery .

we also sell the big packs of contraception , and so -- this is getting a little hairy .
as she turns , friction between her pointe shoe and the floor , and somewhat between her body and the air , reduces her momentum .

and when males from different populations are feeding within ear@@ shot , phrases are often exchanged , maybe because new songs make them more attractive to breeding females .
what do you do ?
we &apos;re only beginning to understand why we sleep to begin with , but we do know it &apos;s essential .
sleep@@ lessness may also cause inflammation , hall@@ u@@ ci@@ ations , high blood pressure , and it &apos;s even been linked to diabetes and obesity .
having thought that through , I decided denial was not going to be on my agenda ; I had bigger things to worry about , to write about , to research , and I moved on .
they had a journal -- a slick journal -- a &quot; Journal of Hi@@ stor@@ ical Review . &quot;

the last thing that I &apos;ll look for is any technology that seems to be on the org chart without a real home .
and I also thought about suggesting to our recruiting team that some of the technologies we work with every day should come with us on our big recruiting events .
but if all three combinations fail , then you &apos;ll know this group has either one good battery , or none at all .
since there are four good batteries in total and you &apos;ve only accounted for two so far , both of these remaining ones must be good .

the only reason I am who I am is because of my losses , and some of them are extremely painful , but I wouldn &apos;t take any of them away , because every time I lose , it takes a really long time for me to lose again because I learn so much from it .
remember , the experience of having Alzheimer &apos;s is ultimately a result of losing synapses .

as our realities are increasingly based on the information that we &apos;re consuming at the palm of our hand and from the news feeds that we &apos;re scanning and the hash@@ tags and stories that we see trending , the Russian government was the first to recognize how this evolution had turned your mind into the most explo@@ itable device on the planet .
this pan@@ or@@ ama of information that &apos;s so interesting to you gives a state , or anyone for that matter , a perfect back door into your mind .
in early February 2014 , a few weeks before Russia would invade Cri@@ mea , a phone call is posted on YouTube .
Chris Anderson : Elon , hey , welcome back to TED .
I think we need to have at least a tenfold improvement in the cost per mile of tunneling .
could you apply these tunnels to use for this Hyper@@ loop idea you released a few years ago .
em : yeah , so we &apos;ve been sort of put@@ tering around with the Hyper@@ loop stuff for a while .
em : I think there &apos;s no real length limit .
how many houses do you believe could end up having this type of roof@@ ing ?
so just delivered the upper stage at high velocity .
I think this might have been at sort of Mach 7 or so , delivery of the upper stage .
yeah , and that &apos;s the vehicle .
em : I think it &apos;s important to have a future that is inspiring and appealing .
like , why do you want to live ?
so when I think , like , what is the fundamental good of a company like Tesla , I would say , hopefully , if it accelerated that by a decade , potentially more than a decade , that would be quite a good thing to occur .
this is not inevitable .
with Tesla , you want to have sustainable energy , so you made these super sexy , exciting cars to do it .
I &apos;m happy to see all of you here today .
but they don &apos;t go far enough , because they make people jump through hoops .
we are hearing , in essence , an invasion of the Arctic by sub@@ arctic species .
but the Décima , in Spain , its birthplace , disappeared ; it died out .
I prefer that you listen to it .
what have I learned in these 15 years since the song was born from going all over the world with four lines written on a coaster from a bar in Madrid ?
the day we took Paul into the hospital for the last time was the most difficult day of my life .
it was the right one .
one of the first things Paul said to me after his diagnosis was , &quot; I want you to get remar@@ ried . &quot;
the clinicians taking care of Paul gave me an even deeper appreciation for my colleagues in health care .
now , for starters , what &apos;s totally boring is understanding the motor@@ ic aspects of the behavior .
this is the realm of neural plasticity , the fact that your brain can change in response to experience , and if your previous months have been filled with stress and trauma , your amygdala will have enlar@@ ged .
and as an example of this , if as a fetus you were exposed to a lot of stress hormones through your mother , epi@@ genetics is going to produce your amygdala in adulthood as a more exc@@ itable form , and you &apos;re going to have elevated stress hormone levels .
but they are increasingly displaced by modern agriculture , which promotes till@@ age , mon@@ oc@@ ro@@ pping and the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides which degrade the land and turn it into a net emit@@ ter of greenhouse gases .
but here &apos;s the interesting thing .
now , a solution that often does not get talked enough about , family planning .
R@@ CA started this whole thing off , and said , you know , televisions are the future , not computers .
they didn &apos;t fit in at the Institute .
they were real sol@@ der@@ ing-@@ gun type guys , and they actually built this thing .
he had to focus the memory -- seems OK .
so , already , they &apos;re complaining about the manuals : &quot; before closing down in disgust ... &quot; &quot; The General Ari@@ th@@ metic : operating Lo@@ gs . &quot;

I &apos;m a movie star , I &apos;m 51 years of age , and I don &apos;t use Bot@@ ox as yet .
( Laughter ) I &apos;ve also been made to understand there are lots of you here who haven &apos;t seen my work , and I feel really sad for you .
I started to sell everything , from hair oil to diesel generators .
W@@ T@@ F .
the present you is hopeful .
but we might not be so lucky .
I just mean whatever it is that the human would prefer their life to be like .
it can understand that ; it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s going to steal .
firstly we collect a lot of our samples in the middle of winter .
and at even even lower levels , they can actually begin to dissolve .
and did you know we actually have cold-@@ water corals in Irish waters , just off our continental shelf ?
the last example I have are these healthy tropical corals .
not surprisingly , they do better academically .
it just doesn &apos;t fly because it runs contrary to basic human nature .
now that may sound complicated , but it , too , is revolutionary , because it provides us a whole new strategy to reach a global price on carbon , which is ultimately what we need .
you need to have contin@@ gencies for the un@@ foreseen , the unexpected and the unknown , whenever and however they may happen .
if that patient has someone in the outside world to assist them and help them , the doctor can implement the best care with that connection in mind .
I &apos;ve been teaching visual intelligence for over 15 years , and to my great amazement and astonishment -- to my never-ending astonishment and amazement , I have seen that looking at art with a critical eye can help to anchor us in our world of uncharted waters , whether you are a param@@ il@@ itary tro@@ oper , a caregiver , a doctor or a mother .
you should know that these farmers collect about 60 percent of their annual income all at once , right after the harvest .
this type of solution is hugely popular with modern politicians , mostly because , well , they cost next to nothing .
the basic income is not a favor , but a right .
if they stopped working , we &apos;d be in trouble .
I went to class , sat down , took my Kenyan history notes , and there I was , down Kenyan coastal town , with the great Me@@ k@@ ati@@ li@@ li wa M@@ enz@@ a , the Gi@@ ri@@ ama woman who led her people against British colonial rule .
and then , when it was sure everybody was looking at us , in its final show and official introduction , I had my first full-blown seizure , which was the beginning of what has been a 15-@@ year-long affair .
( sigh ) I had so much frustration in me .
I went on -- ( Applause ) I went on to employ five people , when I began what was Kenya &apos;s first free mental health and epilepsy support line .
hats off to them .
what really matters is how we humans feel about living and working with these machines .
but today , 100,000 Black women and girls stand on this stage with us .
black women are dying at alarming rates , and I used to be a classroom teacher , and I was at South Atlanta High School , and I remember standing in front of my classroom , and I remember a statistic that half of Black girls will get diabetes unless diet and levels of activity change .
53 percent of us are obese .
137 is more than gun violence , cigarette smoking and HIV combined , every day .
for Black women whose bodies are buck@@ ling under the weight of systems never designed to support them , GirlTrek is a lifeline .
let me do what no one else has done for me and my community . &quot;
as I looked out the open hatch , I saw hundreds of Lib@@ erians in another line , children strapped to their backs .
my condition had changed .
one billion people live in the world &apos;s most remote communities , and despite the advances we &apos;ve made in modern medicine and technology , our innovations are not reaching the last mile .
but nurses and doctors are concentrated in cities , so rural communities like Musu &apos;s have been left behind .
one of my favorite things to do is to care for patients with community health workers .
well , we know that there are still millions of people dying from preventable causes in rural communities around the world .
and there &apos;s an hour &apos;s worth of our cups .
and so , this piece is made up of lots and lots of boxes of cigarettes .
Thank you and good afternoon .
once again , politics is personal .
millions of Americans became activists overnight , pouring into the streets in record numbers in record time .
we experience the effects of good government in our lives , just as Lorenzetti did in his life .
( Laughter ) And being a teenager , what I did in there , of course , was just talk on the phone for staggering amounts of time .
here &apos;s a normal baby .
but it looks the same in Miami , Florida .
now this represents the nucleus of a mosquito cell , and that t@@ angle in the middle represents its genome , the sum total of its genes .
scientists added a single gene that codes for a protein represented by this orange ball that feeds back on itself to keep cran@@ king out more of that protein .
here &apos;s the mayor of a city releasing the first batch of what they call the &quot; friendly A@@ e@@ des . &quot;
Thank you .
come love come , the road lies free , I &apos;ll wait for you in Tennessee .
and in the African-American community , it &apos;s been the work of many hundreds of years to find a way to lift ourselves up .
up above my head up above my head I hear shou@@ tin &apos; in the air , that &apos;s right , and I really do believe I really do believe there &apos;s a heaven somewhere .
accessing social media or Wikipedia would be a lot like -- well , from the inside at least -- like consulting your own memory .
and so maybe it &apos;s no surprise that we &apos;re in a situation , a paradoxical situation , of thinking that we know so much more , and yet not agreeing on what it is we know .
you might have a brain chip in your head feeding you all the wrong information .
that &apos;s an example of the bad faith towards the truth that I &apos;m talking about .
these are just ordinary resi@@ dences expressing the ordinary splend@@ or of cities .
but at ground level , the plaza feels like a black glass cage .
architecture is only one , but it &apos;s an important one .
it comes in everything from enormous , ultrac@@ lear sheets to translucent bricks .
think of driving for a second .
I had no idea what I was doing . I was working 14-@@ plus hour days , seven days a week .
it consists of three pages .
&quot; what if I ... ? &quot;
it could be asking someone out , ending a relationship , asking for a promotion , quitting a job , starting a company .
so for getting depressed in London , I could take a portable blue light with me and use it for 15 minutes in the morning .
there were some hiccups , sure .
we &apos;re now in the fashion business , no matter what we do for a living , we &apos;re in the fashion business .
Pro@@ c@@ tor and Gamble knows this , right ?
if it &apos;s very good , it &apos;s not going to work , because no one &apos;s going to notice it .
( Laughter ) Frank Gehry didn &apos;t just change a museum ; he changed an entire city &apos;s economy by designing one building that people from all over the world went to see .
here &apos;s what some of you did this morning , although you did it outside , not on a treadmill .
it didn &apos;t decrease its preferred speed at all .
how do they do it then ? believe it or not , they grab on by inter@@ molecular forces , by Van der Wa@@ als forces .
for those same years , my father and brother both died of cancer , and I was probably over@@ anxious about illness .
the doctors assured us there was nothing wrong and I shouldn &apos;t worry , but I wasn &apos;t so sure .
so it &apos;s two days before Christmas , 1994 , and the dermat@@ ologist takes a quick look at her neck and says , &quot; She has pseu@@ do@@ x@@ anth@@ oma elas@@ tic@@ um . &quot;
( Laughter ) There is no limit to what we can accomplish together .
again , see number one .
try to do a little better .
to summon grace , say , &quot; Help , &quot; and then buckle up .
it means the divine or a loving , anim@@ ating intelligence , or , as we learned from the great &quot; De@@ ter@@ ior@@ ata , &quot; &quot; the cosmic muffin . &quot;
and don &apos;t worry -- get on with your life .
( Laughter ) I documented as I reluctantly cut off three to four inches of my beloved hair .
guess what ? it &apos;s London .
worst-@@ case scenario , we don &apos;t get a clean start .
it &apos;s a real tragedy that the world &apos;s most famous refugee can &apos;t come to speak to you here today .
now , I don &apos;t know , you tell me .
and when I was teenager , I asked my aunt , &quot; Can you take me to meet Mon@@ sie@@ ur Mau@@ rice ? &quot;
and when people say to me , &quot; There &apos;s a backlash against refugees , &quot; what I say to them is , &quot; No , there &apos;s a polarization , and at the moment , those who are fearful are making more noise than those who are proud . &quot;
what you &apos;re seeing is my brain activity when I was relaxed and curious .
workers are even sent home if their brains show less-@@ than-@@ stellar concentration on their jobs , or emotional ag@@ itation .
shockingly , people rated their social security number as far more sensitive than any other kind of information , including their brain data .
and just to get at the details of this , I want to share with you my own personal story .
for people who have the great privilege of studying medicine and anthropology -- I had come from parents who were refugees .
they wanted schools .
that &apos;s what we do now at the World Bank Group .
our own data suggest to us that two thirds of all jobs , currently existing jobs in developing countries , will be lost because of automation .
and on the other side , of course , is a normal child , and the normal child has all of these neuronal connections .
this is from a group called Zi@@ pline , a cool company , and they literally are rocket scientists .
don &apos;t let anyone ever tell you that you cannot be President of the World Bank . &quot;
just one whi@@ ff of the noxious polluted air from 2030 brought home the point that no amount of data can .
well , it all started when Arnold was asked to submit a saliva sample in this spit kit to the N@@ H@@ I -- the UK &apos;s National Health In@@ surance service .
when Arnold received his health insurance bill , he was shocked and scared to see that his premi@@ ums had gone through the roof , beyond anything he or his family could ever afford .
but what about what we can &apos;t avoid ?
inside the brain , the bacteria swiftly infect the men@@ inges .
this breaks down blood vessels , letting blood see@@ p out and form what starts out looking like a rash , and evolves into big disc@@ ol@@ oured bl@@ ots beneath the skin .
and while I was there , I began to be curious about what would happen to my physical body after I died .
and I was like , &quot; M@@ mmm . &quot;
that 0.1 percent benefits us more than them .
there are 6@@ 5.@@ 3 million people who have been forced out of their homes because of war -- the largest number in history .
and whose needs are not being accommodated for ?
but the coffee shop , it &apos;s not designed well , at least not for me .
I have short limbs and ach@@ ondro@@ plastic facial features , my forehead and my nose .
and if a child does get to see their parent in prison , they have to go through the same pat@@ -@@ down searches as the adults .
Story@@ book Dads began in 2003 , when Sharon Berry , a civilian worker in a prison , realized just how much many prisoners wanted to stay in contact with their children .
Charlie : I figure they &apos;d probably look a bit like that snow@@ man &apos;s belly .
and since 2003 , over 60,000 DVDs and CDs have been sent out to the children of prisoners .
let &apos;s go back to the story of &quot; The U@@ gly D@@ uck@@ ling . &quot;
I asked him , what was it like being in America during the recent presidential election ?
what do we worship ?
they &apos;ll look at the way we talk about morality as being true to oneself , the way we talk about politics as a matter of individual rights , and they &apos;ll look at this wonderful new religious ritual we have created .
and I think they &apos;ll conclude that what we worship in our time is the self , the me , the I .
and here , forgive me if I get personal .
Martin Luther King Memorial , more than a dozen quotes from his speeches .
I hadn &apos;t realized this would be such a universal phrase .
now , when you realize , when you do the math , when we calculate the r@@ pm for this object , mathematically , we should be able to go all the way to a million r@@ pm .
it really is this portion of the work that excites me the most -- that smile , to be able to share simple but powerful tools with people around the world .
( Laughter ) But I will tell you how to record from this .
let me close with something that &apos;s very important and dear to my heart .
it was a big opportunity .
I ate a lot of lettuce and bread , because that &apos;s all I had .
personally , I feel like I &apos;ve been preparing for this moment my whole life .
but I want to share with you guys today my perspective as a geologist in how understanding earth &apos;s past can help inform and guide decisions that we make today about how to sustainably live on earth &apos;s surface .
if we zoom in here a little bit , I want to talk to you guys a little bit about one of the things that happens .
we can see these beautiful patterns that the rivers make as they &apos;re pushing material down to the sea , but these patterns aren &apos;t static .
for example , the features I just highlighted there tell us that this particular river was probably about three feet deep .
eventually , the rivers rever@@ ted back to a state that was more similar to what they would have looked like before this climate event , but it took a long , long time .
so , in 2010 , Steve Jobs , when he was releasing the iPad , described the iPad as a device that was &quot; extraordinary . &quot;
it &apos;s an incredible experience . &quot;
there were stopping cues everywhere .
it &apos;s far away , as far away as possible .
( Laughter ) So I don &apos;t want to experience clouds , let alone study them .
we know it &apos;s going to get hot , but we don &apos;t know exactly how hot it &apos;s going to get .
but these satellites were designed for weather , not climate .
and I saw that , right ?
and no one has ever offered her silence and deep reflection as a way to be powerful .
and it is that burst of care , that healing , that gives her the fuel to defeat Mid@@ as and reclaim herself .
Thank you .
consciousness and intelligence are very different things .
it &apos;s just that when we agree about our hallucinations , we call that reality .
there are experiences of inten@@ ding to do things and of being the cause of things that happen in the world .
it was un@@ fath@@ om@@ able .
it &apos;s very easy just to slip into sil@@ ver-@@ bullet thinking , as if some simple solution existed .
and then the temple guides would take this more ethno@@ graphic , this more qualitative information , and interpret the oracle &apos;s bab@@ blings .
now to be clear , I &apos;m not saying that big data systems are hu@@ ffing eth@@ y@@ lene gas , or that they &apos;re even giving inv@@ al@@ id predictions .
now , in order to tell you the story , I want to go back to a pivotal moment in US history , and that is the moment when fac@@ tional disagreement and partisanship was born .
and sure enough , nationally , small local groups -- they were called Demo@@ cra@@ tic-@@ Republican Soci@@ eties -- began to form and protest against Feder@@ ali@@ st-@@ dominated he@@ ge@@ mony .
I always live in the present -- I love the present .
that &apos;s my camera lens . the first one -- the one I shot my Bob Dylan film with 35 years ago .
( Laughter ) So in the spirit of incentivizing the rampant failure of people all over the world and enticing the so-called normal to just give it a rest already , here are five tips to fail at being disabled .
this one is best reserved -- very important note -- this one is best reserved for people you know well , because random strangers typically don &apos;t appreciate te@@ achable moments .
but I know what a straight line looks like .
many of us have lost family , friends or loved ones to this horrible disease .
the first is cancer genomics .
well , I wouldn &apos;t be up here giving a talk if it didn &apos;t .
olfactory receptors -- tiny scent detectors -- are packed into your nose , each one patiently waiting to be activated by the odor , or lig@@ and , that it &apos;s been assigned to detect .
if you are a pancreas or a kidney and you need a specialized chemical sensor that will allow you to keep track of a specific molecule , why reinvent the wheel ?
this is exciting stuff .
then the skeletons are over@@ grown by algae .
I don &apos;t know if they were taking bets or what .
creativity , if anything , that creates noise .
but when I hear the expression &quot; humane technology , &quot; I think about ca@@ ge@@ -free chickens or something .
even zombie shows -- what is every zombie show about ?
what should the car do , and who should decide ?
( Laughter ) So if we acknowledge that cars will have to make trade-offs on the road , how do we think about those trade-offs , and how do we decide ?
well , what about plain old leg@@ ge@@ d-@@ robot delivery ?
( Applause ) So , Spot : how do you feel about having just finished your TED performance ?
in high school , let &apos;s just say I wasn &apos;t a great student . OK ?
I decided , let me keep taking these art history classes .
I &apos;m sorry . this is a really important chapter to me .
I made this .
all this art history that I had been absorbing helped me to realize that painting is a language .
there is a reason why he is the highest in the composition here .
painting is a visual language where everything in the painting is meaningful , is important .
I &apos;m trying to give you that opportunity .
so when I said earlier that cohousing is an antidote to isolation , what I should have said is that cohousing can save your life .
but as an architect , I &apos;m going to suggest that you take a walk with your neighbor , share a meal together , and call me in 20 years .
Thank you .
we find some back@@ packs .
( Applause ) And I &apos;m really excited because now we have a pretty powerful solution to this low-level computer vision problem , and anyone can take it and build something with it .
we made eye contact and it was then that the young man understood : his rubber boot with his leg still in it had landed far away .
( Applause ) It rained all night that night .
during the march , the head guerrillas told us that Pin@@ cho had died , and that they had found his remains eaten by an an@@ ac@@ on@@ da .
and when you get there , the police are waiting on you .
we looked at the confession , and it turned out , there was something in the confession that those boys could not have known .
if there &apos;s anything that we &apos;ve learned , anything that I &apos;ve learned , with this conviction integrity work , it &apos;s that justice doesn &apos;t happen .
people make justice happen .
if it did , Mr. Stu@@ ckey wouldn &apos;t have died in prison .
just a minute .
you don &apos;t have to -- I mean , some people spend their careers and their lives , like public defenders , doing justice every day .
and we talked , we laughed , we hugged , we cried .
that &apos;s why we advocate for baby trust .
regardless of the race and the family positions in which they are born .
and therefore the motivation to do that .
I know it &apos;s hard to believe that anything that &apos;s so small or only has one cell can do anything powerful , but they can .
so this is my brain in an fMRI , and I learned that in the default mode is when we connect disparate ideas , we solve some of our most nagging problems , and we do something called &quot; autobiographical planning . &quot;
( audio ) Amanda I@@ tz@@ ko : I am absolutely itching .
I feel a little bit crazy , because I have noticed that I pick up my phone when I &apos;m just walking from one room to another , getting on the elevator , and even -- and this is the part that I am really embarrassed to actually say out loud -- in the car .
some of them told me that they didn &apos;t recognize some of the emotions that they felt during challenge week , because , if you think about it , if you have never known life without connectivity , you may never have experienced boredom .
they felt happier .
how many companies have you interacted with today ?
it &apos;s their intrinsic motivation .
the whole machine in 2013 that took art online and out@@ put@@ ted money was totally non@@ functional .
there &apos;s this bubbling soup of ideas and experiments and progress right now , and it &apos;s pointing in the direction of getting creators paid .
so , Pat@@ re@@ on has over 50,000 creators on the platform making salaries -- getting paid every month for putting art online , for being a creative person .
this is when the band had hit our first machine , so things were really cran@@ king .
but it &apos;s not just the kind of sprawl you think of , or many people think of , as low-@@ density development out at the periphery of the metropolitan area .
the reality is , the efficiency of vehicles -- you can do it with or without a steering wheel , it doesn &apos;t matter .
I put those up in about 30 intersections .
I went back to my office , I gathered my staff around and I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to take this man at his word , and others like him .
I &apos;m lucky that I have city employees that are willing to work side by side with our pan@@ hand@@ lers .
and imagine how this could revolutionize the way we manage allergies and chronic disease .
for example , suppose you &apos;re walking along a beach and come across a series of marks in the sand that spell out a verse of poetry .
he was a gre@@ g@@ arious man .
and that &apos;s when I discovered a low-fat , glu@@ ten@@ -free diet is not what it takes to live to 100 in the blue zone .
so let &apos;s now look at her data in summary , going from the least powerful predictor to the strongest .
whether you have your hypertension treated is good .
do you play bridge or poker , have a book club ?
( Laughter ) But he believes in the tooth fairy .
I think that one thing that shapes perceptions in the public , about science , is belief systems and biases .
( Laughter ) Two inches of snow shut the city of Atlanta down .
the reason is ageism : discrimination and stereot@@ yping on the basis of age .
( Applause ) Look at gender .
this discrimination affects our health , our well-being and our income , and the effects add up over time .
today , I &apos;m a 30-@@ something , certified dir@@ ty-@@ dish lea@@ ver , and breaking this habit is hard .
what got her here won &apos;t get her there .
sure , it was going to be inefficient and annoying , but what bothered me most was his confidence that it &apos;s not how they &apos;ll do things in the future .
and when it happened , would he even know how to have effective meetings without pre-@@ meetings ?
music has always been a big part of my life .
every Wednesday , we did something called &quot; rhythmic dic@@ tation , &quot; and I was pretty good at it .
our lives are not only conducted by music , they &apos;re also composed of it .
the New York Post filed a Freedom of Information Act request , got all the teachers &apos; names and all their scores and they published them as an act of teach@@ er-@@ shaming .
( Applause ) The era of blind faith in big data must end .
I &apos;m not sure I can -- &quot; But before we knew it , we were into a conversation about his marriage .
( Laughter ) Because the sc@@ allo@@ p shell has been the icon and badge of your walk , and every arrow that you have seen along that way has been pointing underneath a sc@@ allo@@ p shell .
she said , &quot; It was really incredible .
the mature identity is able to live in the full cycle .
so I cofounded , own and operate a tire recycling company , and I &apos;m really proud of what we &apos;ve done .
so , there are so many great examples in this book , and I suggest that everybody just read it because it answers the question I asked earlier , which was where are we going to get the wealth to build the types of business that we want .
because know this : they be few and we be many .
but over the course of the next year , I came to discover that this orphanage that I had been supporting was terribly corrupt .
they had parents , and the few that were orphaned had other living relatives , like grandparents and aunties and uncles and other siblings .
I now lead an amazing team of Cambodian social workers , nurses and teachers .
her name is Tor@@ n She &apos;s a strong , brave and fiercely intelligent girl .
I studied physics in college .
but it got my attention , and so I did some research .
so first it looked the sun had a little notch in its edge , and then that notch grew larger and larger , turning the sun into a cre@@ scent .
and it was all very interesting , but I wouldn &apos;t say it was spectacular .
well , at that , a cheer erupted from the beach , and I took off my eclipse glasses , because at this point during the total eclipse , it was safe to look at the sun with the naked eye .
and over time , I &apos;ve become something else : an eclipse evange@@ list .
it makes us feel connected .
but it &apos;s not about the 17@@ 4 seconds .
you let it cool to room temperature , and then , as the am@@ monia re@@ evaporates and combines with the water back on the er@@ st@@ while hot side , it creates a powerful cooling effect .
but once in a while , a cell might taste bad .
and there are endless han@@ do@@ vers between departments .
they had all the skills needed right there in the team .
and we had started to like their model , so we were already thinking of how to apply some of these ideas to a bank .
but it also means that each employee needs to become a leader , regardless of their formal title .
it &apos;s about all of us stepping up to take initiative .
interestingly , a &quot; Jeopardy ! &quot; question always asks , always ends with &quot; this &quot; something : &quot; this &quot; planet , &quot; this &quot; country , &quot; this &quot; rock musician , and so on .
the machine basically does the same .
so if it can find a word which is a planet and which is co-@@ occurring with these key@@ words , that must be the answer .
but most of the students just pack the knowledge without understanding the meaning of the knowledge , so that is not knowledge , that is just memorizing , and AI can do the same thing .
only 5@@ 58 people have ever been to outer space .
ultimately , 19 people were killed in this disaster .
and that &apos;s the tension I want to create with my work , because I believe it is that contemplation , that internal dialogue that will lead to greater interest in our planet and more awareness of what we &apos;re doing to it .
( video ) ( Singing in Arabic ) ( Singing ends ) Not a very pleasant sight , right ?
we don &apos;t have photographs taken of it from the back .
using S@@ ket@@ ch@@ fab &apos;s online viewer , we can show that we have reconstructed three parts of the exterior of the tomb , but we also have photos of the inside , so we &apos;re beginning to create a reconstruction of the wall and the ceiling .
so we have begun to develop a tool that allows us to extract images from websites like Flickr , based on their ge@@ ot@@ ags , to complete reconstructions .
it helps us connect with our ancestors and their stories , but we &apos;re losing pieces of it every day to natural disasters and in areas of conflict .
unbeknownst to them , the humans have entered into the world of the fairies .
it &apos;s so beautiful : no energy bill , no maintenance .
( Applause ) Thank you .
so when these sh@@ ei@@ k@@ hs of Qatar started to call : &quot; how much for 10 kilometers ? &quot;
( Laughter ) Are we good ?
we did the design for that -- 2008 .
and these can be a lot of different things , but roughly , a sense of alienation , a sense of isolation , questioning your own identity , but also feeling that your in-group is under attack , and your in group might be based on a nationality or an ethnicity or a religion , and feeling that larger powers around you are doing nothing to help .
I &apos;m going to call them &quot; ems . &quot;
( Laughter ) because I see a neglected question : what would actually happen ?
it &apos;s computer hardware sitting in a server rack somewhere .
that means ems have to be working most of the time .
and in order to do that , I realized that we would need radical tru@@ thfulness and radical transparency .
in order to have an idea meritocracy , we have let people speak and say what they want .
( music ) It can be the other butto@@ ck .
( Laughter ) All right . so I &apos;m going to take a piece of Chopin .
and one of them came to me the next morning and he said , &quot; You know , I &apos;ve never listened to classical music in my life , but when you played that shopping piece ... &quot;
and the vow was , &quot; I will never say anything that couldn &apos;t stand as the last thing I ever say . &quot;
( Applause ) Sh@@ ining eyes .
you can upload a profile and a picture and it will show you available guys within a radius .
G@@ rin@@ d@@ r has been around for a lot longer , since it was much harder to meet your future gay husband at church or the grocery store , or whatever straight people did before they found out they could date on their phones .
Thank you .
I used to think the whole purpose of life was pursuing happiness .
everyone said the path to happiness was success , so I searched for that ideal job , that perfect boyfriend , that beautiful apartment .
I &apos;ll check my phone when someone &apos;s talking to me .
now , finding your purpose is not the same thing as finding that job that makes you happy .
but we don &apos;t always realize that we &apos;re the authors of our stories and can change the way we &apos;re telling them .
this is the world of the complex .
so I think we should play with these patterns .
you see , African art is not just what you buy at Harlem markets in New York .
I worked with children who had to choose between getting an education and actually being forced into marriage .
through my art , I like to start a conversation .
so in 2013 , I made a big gamble .
I quit my job and I moved to New York City to practice art full time .
signed , Beyoncé . &quot;
and it &apos;s not just a sort of teenage refusal to be labeled .
we see the wars , the rages of identity going on all around us .
he threatened to shoot me once when I played in the garden as a kid , and many weekends , sha@@ ven@@ -@@ headed National Front activists arrived at his house and emerged with scores of plac@@ ards screaming that they wanted us to go back home .
and what about the large number of people across the globe who can &apos;t point to a monument from their past , who don &apos;t possess a sacred written text , who can &apos;t har@@ k back to the past gl@@ ories of a civilization or empire ?
and we washed them , we cut them up , we glued them together , and we began to draw on them , creating a huge canvas .
bur@@ g@@ lars were caught breaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Water@@ gate Hotel , the Nixon administration was involved in covering up the burgl@@ ary , and eventually Nixon had to step down as president .
the system is set up to prevent something like that from happening without a judge being involved .
particularly since September 11 the law has fallen down on the job , and we do not have the rules in place that we need .
in fact , from 2000 to 2010 , 5.@@ 7 million manufacturing jobs were lost .
a Lincoln M@@ K@@ Z would go from 3@@ 7,000 dollars to 4@@ 8,000 .
it isn &apos;t about enormously extending human lifespan or immortality .
your telomeres do just fine .
can you imagine the impact on children of living years in a war zone ?
in this place , we reported a new type of microalgae that grew only on top of the spider@@ webs that covered the cave entrance .
we can program rules for pattern formation , how cells in a tissue determine what role they &apos;re going to take on and set the patterns of our bodies .
lifestyle ?
to simulate me ?
and everybody was doing that .
it becomes very , very interesting .
like 1,700 years ago , it &apos;s already there , in the book .
the biggest recorded individual was four-@@ and-a-half-@@ feet long and weighed about 550 pounds .
yes , you heard me right : they can walk .
and then in April , state security personnel came back .
rather , we must remind them that governments exist to serve not only those who build and live in luxury homes , but also those who clean and guard them .
he got arrested for armed robbery .
last month we introduced fonio to shoppers in New York City and online , in a package that makes it attractive and desirable and accessible .
well , let me tell you , socioeconomic trends don &apos;t last forever .
actually , that is what started the urbanization process .
I mean , all those little faces on a flat screen , sometimes you don &apos;t even know who is talking .
it was the end of October in the mountains in Austria .
and I &apos;m trying to change that .
you get the people who are doing it because they believe in the mission , and they &apos;re the best people .
I discovered this when I made this performance in 2013 on Heritage Day .
I looked at what the day means -- the Women &apos;s March to the union buildings in 1956 , peti@@ tioning against the pass laws .
juxtapos@@ ed with the hypocrisy of how women are treated , especially in public spaces today , I decided to do something about it .
( video ) Woman : ( cheering ) Woman 2 ( off@@ screen ) : yes !
I told them that I &apos;d explain later , but we had to postpone the meeting because I was going to perform her as the statue came down .
as the time came , the crane came alive .
because we do not invest in knowledge , people come to Africa now not as a place of intellectual enrichment , but as a place where they s@@ ate their thirst for ex@@ o@@ tica .
this is a fantasy city , even though it looks real .
it needs to be accessible .
there was one really interesting contest held by the Fin@@ nish city of H@@ ä@@ me@@ en@@ lin@@ na .
Thank you .
as you know , many people have a tough start in life , but they end up doing very well on some measure nevertheless , and this study starts to explain how .
in other words , which ones beat the odds .
good parenting only reduced the educational gap between the rich and poor children by about 50 percent .
Thank you .
as a four@@ th-@@ generation Kenyan Muslim of Indian origin , it bothered me that in four generations , there wasn &apos;t a single marriage in my family outside of my small religious community .
and if we pay for your faith , is it really faith ? &quot;
now , over the next two-and-a-half years , I shot 37 insects from their collection .
and the feedback has been great .
and , you know , standing in front of a three-@@ meter insect , they could have been horrified .
on July 4 , 2013 , my world came crashing in on me .
( Laughter ) OK , first I want to talk to anyone who watches movies .
great !
why ?
I said , &quot; I studied agriculture for 12 years , from primary to Sen@@ ior Six , as we say in East Africa , S@@ S@@ 3 in West Africa or 12th grade .
I was privileged to sit in on a loan negotiating session in an African country .
Thank you .
that tree will grow , and then it will have leaves .
the result of this is that an entire third of Cambodia &apos;s population was lost in less than four years , and in that number were 90 percent of Khmer dance artists .
for a flower does not ask for anyone &apos;s permission to bloom .
( Laughter ) Number one : we are many !
I contacted D@@ x Con@@ sul@@ ting .
are you having a hard time motivating your American millennial employees ?
number four : we &apos;re big picture people .
the Chinese way of writing an address is country , city , and street .
granted , we Chinese millennials are acting more and more individual nowadays , but ten years of iPhone and online dating apps cannot wipe out thousands of years of Confucian cultures .
they remembered that bats fly at night .
I said , &quot; W@@ ere you playing a car game earlier today ? &quot;
what if we start looking for the positive impacts that this technology can have in our children &apos;s lives ?
I believe that the key to preventing our job@@ less future is to rediscover what makes us human , and to create a new generation of human-@@ centered jobs that allow us to unlock the hidden talents and passions that we carry with us every day .
Thank you .
so I was just sitting in my room to be transferred .
I shared these stories with my boss at Cur@@ rent TV at the time after I came home .
this question of at what point does supply struggle to keep up with surging demand is one that started off as an interest for me while I was trading and became an absolute obsession .
now this is the gap between its current yield and the theoretical maximum yield it can achieve .
commercialization is about the entire agricultural system .
being a gang leader in the inner city wasn &apos;t such a bad deal in the mid- &apos; 80s -- the early &apos; 80s , let me say .
this is a very dangerous job , being in a gang .
( Laughter ) So his greeting was not particularly warm , but they did say , well , OK -- let &apos;s hear your questions on your survey .
to put it into perspective : if you compare this to the soldiers in Iraq , for instance , right now fighting the war : 0.5 percent .
often , our theories fail quite miserably when we over the data , but what &apos;s kind of interesting is that in this setting , it turned out that some of the economic theories that worked not so well in the real economy worked very well in the drug economy , in some sense , because it &apos;s un@@ fet@@ tered capitalism .
compens@@ ating differential -- it &apos;s why we think gar@@ bag@@ e@@ men might be paid more than people who work in parks .
now , before &quot; The Simp@@ sons , &quot; before &quot; G@@ um@@ by , &quot; before &quot; Betty Boo@@ p , &quot; before there was such a thing as cinema and television , animation was hugely popular in this form .
instead of being sealed off in an automobile , I ride my bike , take buses and trains and walk a lot .
and I realized that it was the movement of my own body through the landscape that was creating the animation .
there &apos;s a lot of gray area in workplace romance .
question five : why are coworkers often attracted to each other ?
but there &apos;s another ingredient that has to be added : attraction tends to happen when there &apos;s work that demands close collaboration .
it &apos;s the confirmation that we are in a movement .
part of the work of the Me Too Movement is about the restoration of that humanity for survivors , because the violence doesn &apos;t end with the act .
and if you don &apos;t find it , create it and lean into that .
a couple unique circumstances change this equation for killer whales .
we urgently need to invest in restoring salmon populations to save them from extinction .
and as they finally began to lay supplies , they found both their ponies and mot@@ or-@@ sle@@ dges ineffective in the harsh ice and snow .
Thank you so much .
and six months later , we sat down at Kennedy Space Center .
her name is Lily .
they know that at the end of the day , these are people who are part of families -- someone &apos;s mother , someone &apos;s grandmother , someone &apos;s best friend and someone &apos;s baby ; undeni@@ ably human , and therefore , not disposable .
if it &apos;s not just about our chromosomes , then what is being a woman about ?
women have mostly female patches and a few male patches .
if everything in , say , our brain cells dissolves almost every day , then how can the brain remember anything past one day ?
and that &apos;s how DNA can remember what happens in the past .
don &apos;t worry , I &apos;ve had therapy so I &apos;m OK -- I &apos;m OK now .
should an embryo cell become a blood cell ?
to truly understand DNA decision-making , we need to see the process of knot formation in atomic detail .
so the current working model is that a unique mix in my mom &apos;s womb caused the precursor genitals to transform one way , but the precursor brain to transform the other way .
so what does it mean to be a woman ?
I decided to meet other people like me and find that out .
what an ingenious method , right ?
if I asked a hundred different polyglots , I heard a hundred different approaches to learning languages .
I can watch it in any language . I love it so much .
first of all , you &apos;ll need effective methods .
if it works for them , it will most probably work for you too .
that would be the perfect time to revise some vocabulary .
Lucas tried to learn English at school for 10 years .
( Laughter ) And she was dark , too .
it was my mother with five little children .
and she said , &quot; You know , you can steel your heart against any kind of trouble , any kind of horror .
which would seem to suggest that apartheid was entirely the business of men .
now , when I was growing up , he used to tell me stories about how he used to b@@ ay@@ on@@ et people , and their intestines would fall out , but they would keep running .
imagine the looks people gave us , &quot; What are these cars driving around doing ? &quot;
my old st@@ ale modes of thinking were invited into the open to see if this is who I wanted to be in life .
we can change the system right now by connecting local election officials like Kat and Marie with 21st-century tools and the training that they need to use them to better serve voters .
it works exactly like the stock market .
it &apos;s really important that they have those three things .
new recruits were forced to swear an oath &quot; to be burned , to be bound , to be beaten , and to be killed by the sword , &quot; and to obey their master &apos;s will without question .
in the end , the rebel army turned sou@@ th- for@@ going what would be their last chance at freedom .
his army was destroyed , and 6@@ 000 cap@@ tives were cruci@@ fied along the Ap@@ pi@@ an Way@@ - a haunting demonstration of Roman authority .
in the course of doing the story , I was looking for children who hadn &apos;t been photographed before , and the Pearl B@@ uck Foundation told me that they worked with a lot of Americans who were donating money to help some of these kids .
it was incredibly cold .
so got towels and put them over our faces and the kids &apos; faces .
and there , in the building , were photographers , waiting for people to jump .
people were always telling Natasha how much she looks like her mother , Gayle .
the captain of the cheer@@ leaders .
this is Natasha &apos;s wedding day .
the next moment , it popped and was gone .
and the quality of the elas@@ ticity is what we call &quot; surface tension . &quot;
when six bubbles are added together , a magical cube appears at the center .
so the solution might not be something you expected .
they like to sit there , bathing in the ink without moving much .
a female from a different species mimics his pulsing patterns : by tri@@ cking the male with her promise of partnership , she l@@ ures him in@@ - and turns him into an easy meal .
camouflage is a good starting point@@ - and one of the most familiar examples of animal trick@@ ery .
and then all of a sudden , you are awakened by five or six total strangers in uniform .
as a first respon@@ der , I consider myself the cavalry .
what makes their situation worse ?
positive change where there wasn &apos;t any .
and that relaxed state is trick@@ ling down to the community , to the citizens .
authentic representations of women matter .
exceptional women are inspiring and aspirational .
and my father was a soldier , and my uncle was a fisherman and also a po@@ acher .
I even &#91; at &#93; that time was not speaking Swahili .
we cut , we dry and we packed them , we mounted them on a folder .
sometimes , they are having a helicopter to supply them with ammunition and so on .
during the first two re@@ bel@@ lions , they killed all animals in the zoo .
I did it myself .
some of you might ask -- and my students always tell me I give hard assignments -- some of you might ask , and rightfully so , &quot; How do we fix this ?
( Laughter ) It must be a collective telling , because individual stories just create a paradigm where we are pit@@ ting one story against another story .
do you want to live into the fullest of your potential ?
so instead , we use arguments like , &quot; It &apos;s just a natural cycle . &quot;
( Laughter ) What we need to fix this thing is rational hope .
but we need a vision of a better future -- a future with abundant energy , with a stable economy , with resources available to all , where our lives are not worse but better than they are today .
but imagine if every home came with a switch beside the front door , that when you left the house , you could turn off everything except your fridge .
a public , De@@ wey long ago observed , is constitu@@ ted through discussion and debate .
so what are these functions ?
because it lacks the institutional , organizational , manag@@ erial forms to turn it into capital .
second is , you &apos;re problem solvers , but you &apos;re not engaging your global responsibility .
and this is , again , one of those assumptions -- the way car seats are an assumption that we &apos;ve inherited in governments , and doors .
for many years this went along , and everything was fine .
and so I think the answer to this puzzle is that there &apos;s a much better solution out there , that &apos;s gotten nobody excited because everyone is so delighted with the way car seats are presumably working .
to produce these animations , an animator at a studio has to anticipate what &apos;s going to happen in the actual game , and then has to animate that particular sequence .
if I push Chris a bit , like this , for example , he &apos;ll react to it .
it &apos;s called the central pattern generator .
we did get it to work eventually , after tweaking a bit here and there .
that was really exciting for us to see that .
( Laughter ) You can see , it &apos;s always reacting .
but what we found over the past few months is that this approach -- that we &apos;re pretty much standard upon -- is incredibly powerful .
so , this was not something we actually put in there .
it was the best month of my life , because I just sat back and I read books and watched movies .
as I say in my book , I &apos;m Jewish in the same way the O@@ live Garden is Italian .
and this man came up to me and he said , &quot; Why are you dressed like that ? &quot;
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a very relaxing vo@@ cation . I recommend it .
so , whatever you think of crea@@ tionism -- and I think it &apos;s crazy -- they did a great job .
but it was interesting because I had some very preconceived notions about , for instance , evangelical Christianity , and I found that it &apos;s such a wide and varied movement that it is difficult to make gener@@ alizations about it .
( Laughter ) Seri@@ ously , and it worked . and yes , that was actually a rented sheep , so I had to return that in the morning , but it served well for a day .
( Laughter ) But if I say , &quot; What color is Ul@@ tra She@@ en ? &quot; -- oh , a smile emerges , stories about their grandmother &apos;s bathroom ensu@@ e .
passer@@ sby would ask me , &quot; Why are you painting that house when you know the city &apos;s just going to come and tear it down ? &quot;
and we &apos;ve never faced such a massive amount of information which is not curated by those whose profession leads them to abi@@ de by the truth , to fact-@@ check and to maintain a code of conduct and a code of professional ethics .
so many of us have been disappointed -- A@@ ung San Su@@ u Ky@@ i , what &apos;s happened recently , it &apos;s like , &quot; No ! another one bites the dust . &quot;
you know , it &apos;s heartbreaking .
I would say that there &apos;s not enough love going around .
and he said , &quot; I love my wife , she is part of me , we &apos;ve been together for decades . &quot;
( Applause ) CA : Thank you .
this is a plant that was an evolutionary wonder .
and now here &apos;s my Venus flytrap , and inside the leaf , you &apos;re going to notice that there are three little hairs here , and those are trigger hairs .
and to understand why that is , we need to know a little bit more about the behavior of the flytrap .
and so what would happen if we took the action potential from the Venus flytrap and sent it into all the stems of the mi@@ mos@@ a ?
well , in the process of speaking to all these investors , I noticed something interesting was happening .
what if women get less funding than men due to a simple difference in the questions that they get asked ?
while a preven@@ tion-@@ coded one sounds like , &quot; How do you plan to retain your existing customers ? &quot;
given its prevalence in the popular media and the ven@@ ture-@@ funding literature , I expected the bird@@ s-@@ of-@@ a-@@ feather theory of hom@@ ophi@@ ly to hold here , meaning that male VCs would favor male entrepreneurs with promotion questions and female VCs would do the same for female entrepreneurs .
so to my female entrepreneurs out there , here are a couple simple things you could do .
but then Brokk revealed its abilities .
you rush over and pull the emergency switch just as the seventh generation of rabbits was about to mature - har@@ e-@@ rais@@ ingly close to disaster .
it &apos;s catching all the creatures in an enormous net .
you &apos;re about to say , &quot; You are a troll , &quot; but before you can , the troll grabs your brother .
and data prices have been sl@@ ashed so radically that half of urban India and even a part of rural India now have a smartphone with a data connection in their hands .
we &apos;re a two-year-old company , and we have a long way to go .
now , I promise to tell the truth tonight , but just to humor that demographic , I &apos;ve started this talk with a false@@ hood .
now , I &apos;m sure that many of you aren &apos;t familiar with this environmental problem , but you should be , because it &apos;s a rare environmental success story .
so that &apos;s the first lesson .
and I think in this regard , we &apos;re actually seeing some encouraging signs today .
millennials , they support gender equality .
number two : we have to remember , in the words of F@@ anni@@ e Lou Ham@@ er , that &quot; nobody &apos;s free &apos; til everybody &apos;s free . &quot;
CRISPR is the fastest , easiest , and cheapest of the gene editing tools responsible for this new wave of science .
this molecule plays many roles in our cells , but in the case of CRISPR , RNA binds to a special protein called Cas9 .
so , we believe that on Europa there is , in fact , a deep ocean .
they look like , maybe like sun@@ flowers .
around the world , people love .
they pine for love , they live for love , they kill for love , and they die for love .
there &apos;s other love poems that are , of course , just as good , but I don &apos;t think this one can be surpassed .
I am told you will leave me here .
romantic love enables you to focus your mating energy on just one at a time , conserve your mating energy , and start the mating process with this single individual .
the brain areas associated with intense romantic love still become active , 25 years later .
every time you ever hear me on the television or somewhere , I &apos;m ad-@@ li@@ bbing .
I &apos;ve seen them in those agonizing moments when they were scared to death .
I didn &apos;t make good grades in high school .
I &apos;m the embodiment of all truth . &quot;

and now I &apos;m ready , when I hear that call , to go into the presence of God .
as dawn breaks over a mo@@ ve@@ able city of ten thousand y@@ ur@@ ts , Queen Boraqchin is in for a rude awakening .
and that &apos;s what I &apos;m here to teach you .
house sharing can help . &quot;
it was more than my New York City rent .
and those systems could be identified , and they could be grou@@ ped together .
its position , of course , in the middle of Manhattan -- it &apos;s on Hunter &apos;s Point .
architecture for me has been an investigation of a multiplicity of forces that could come from literally any place .
and it made us rethink the whole notion of how we work and how we make things , and it led us to ideas that were closer to fashion design as we flattened out surfaces , and then brought them back together as they could make spatial combinations .
now about half the audience has their left hand up . why is that ?
I need two people to help me out real quick . can you come up ?
KB : Nicole , and ?
and I only want you to allow your hand to float slowly back up from the tabletop as you feel the pressure release , but only when you feel the pressure release .
but it &apos;s OK that even though you &apos;re not hypno@@ tized , you will forget everything that happened .
remember when they threw the Coke out of the airplane , and it landed on the ground , and it didn &apos;t break ?
OK , and when you feel the sensation -- it might take a while -- drop it into the glass .
Steve Jur@@ vet@@ son : mmm , yes .
cars can finally be quiet : peace in the streets , a silent revolution in the cities .
think that I am a violin player on stage .
politics ? one column , two sentences , a headline ! then , in mid-@@ air , all vanishes ! &quot;
after finding a safe space , they should remove their shoes and outer layers , wash any exposed skin , and store the contaminated clothing far away .
we forgot about improving normal lives .
this is a life in which you have as much positive emotion as you possibly can , and the skills to amplify it .
the first life is the pleasant life , and it &apos;s simply , as best we can find it , it &apos;s having as many of the pleasures as you can , as much positive emotion as you can , and learning the skills -- sav@@ oring , mindfulness -- that amplify them , that stretch them over time and space .
Len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affec@@ tivi@@ ties .
just one example .
now , obviously she failed .
and that &apos;s typically how they &apos;ve been used .
in our case , it is , and the aquifer water drives the cre@@ vas@@ se all the way to the base of the ice sheet a thousand meters below .

many nights , I would go downstairs and bring my school@@ work with me .
and that this perception and the disparity increases over time and peaks when girls are between the ages of 10 and 14 .
there is one role I want to ask that all of you play : the role of messenger .
I was not so sure .
( Laughter ) But since I was only 24 and since even presidents have to start somewhere , I settled instead on a run for Congress .
I just want to know : are you really ready for this ? &quot;
so while coming out to the world can be hard , coming in to all the raw , strange magic of ourselves can be much harder .
but the book business is about the only industry that will pay you to investigate your own problems , so -- ( Laughter ) So I decided to give it a try , to trace those cracks with words .
where do you stand yours ?
I could relate to this Homo erectus skeleton very well , because I was the same age that he was when he died .
he had a sco@@ li@@ osis and therefore must have been looked after quite carefully by other female , and probably much smaller , members of his family group , to have got to where he did in life , age 12 .
and the color of each dot corresponds to the type of feeling inside , so the bright ones are happy , and the dark ones are sad .
I built a web interface for viewing &quot; The Wh@@ ale Hunt &quot; that attempts to do just this .
and it leads to just a completely different value system .
woman : Thank you .
the research went on for decades , in fact , it continued even after professor E@@ id@@ us@@ on herself had died .
and the ones who had taken the art course had become substantially better at performing tasks such as diagnosing diseases of the eye by analyzing photographs .
but it is a powerful way to organize our creative lives .
not because you &apos;re in a hurry , but because you &apos;re in no hurry at all .
in anger , we go from being spoiled princesses and hormonal teens , to high maintenance women and shri@@ ll , ugly n@@ ags .
I preemp@@ tively kept the peace , and I taught my daughter to do the same thing .
now I am a woman writing about women and feelings , so very few men with power are going to take what I &apos;m saying seriously , as a matter of politics .
growing up , I was very close to my father .
but not everyone is as lucky as me .
obviously , there &apos;s a variety of medical tools available to perform screening tests .
her name was I@@ da B. Wells .
she was ahead of her time , waging a ti@@ reless struggle for equality and justice decades before many had even begun to imagine it possible .
mass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer , a program that says , manufacture these parts .
and when you go to the beach , what do you get ? you get sand dunes .
he was 11 years old .
and they came , and he brought the press , and that began to get the movement going .
( Applause ) PM : and there are so many of the problems in spite of the successes , and thank you for going through some of them , M@@ arian -- the Freedom Scho@@ ols , the generations of children now who have gone through Children &apos;s Defense Fund programs .
we &apos;ve got to rethink who we are as a people , be an example for the world .
there &apos;s a lot of us who are born without one .
so there &apos;s a lot of us , needless to say .
we often place unrealistic expectations on the things that our bodies do that are outside of our control .
and so what we did is we have two oysters that are stuck together , and this area used to be completely filled in with the cement , and what we &apos;re finding is that the cement has lots of different components in there , but broadly speaking , there are hard , non-@@ sticky parts and there are soft , sticky parts , and what we did is we removed the non-@@ sticky parts selectively to see what &apos;s left for what &apos;s actually att@@ aching the animals , and what we got is this , and we can see there &apos;s this sticky adhesive that &apos;s holding them together .
so let me give you one example .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re thinking about .
we &apos;re working on this , but this is not easy .
so we decided to explode the center into a constellation of fragments , of spaces spread across the vast territory that would immerse the visitors into the wilderness of this amazing place .
and so when I look up to space now , and I have this newfound perspective on the space station going overhead and looking there , and then looking back at my community and seeing the people that I &apos;m living and working with , and co@@ existing with , I think it &apos;s something that we all can do now , especially in these times , to make sure that we have the right perspective .
take the story &quot; The Life You Save May be Your O@@ wn , &quot; where the one-@@ handed drif@@ ter Tom Shi@@ ft@@ let wan@@ ders into the lives of an old woman named Luc@@ yn@@ ell Cr@@ ater and her deaf and mute daughter .
so it &apos;s a very big number .
and the second thing is , we &apos;re going to restructure its architecture .
and so in some ways , all you really need is a clou@@ d@@ book .
and the other thing about this embodiment is that there &apos;s kind of what I call the McLuhan reversal .
it wasn &apos;t like a telephone system where you had control of a line : you had to share packets .
you didn &apos;t trust information very much .
see , I think it &apos;s not really about impression , making people fall for a really perfect illusion , as much as it is to make -- I usually work at the lowest threshold of visual illusion .
I got my first computer when I was a teenager growing up in Accra , and it was a really cool device .
now , let &apos;s compare this with the brain .
and I &apos;ll just take you through that a little bit in the next few slides .
and these are individual potassium ions that are flowing through that pore .
and this is the same thing you see when people compress video to send : they want to make it very sparse , because that file is smaller . and this is what the retina is doing , and it &apos;s doing it just with the circuitry , and how this network of neurons that are interacting in there , which we &apos;ve captured on the chip .
but now they fit in your pocket , on your wrist and can even be implanted inside of your body .
self-assembly is seen in nature in many different places , from lipid membranes to cell structures , so we do know it can be a robust solution .
they repel each other , very much like oil and water or my teenage son and daughter .
and this has a built-in frustration , a tension in the system .
and we can even create more elaborate structures if we use un@@ symmetrical molecules , where one polymer chain is significantly shorter than the other .
multi@@ measure tests really aren &apos;t anything new , but they used to be really expensive and required a PhD sitting across from you and answering lots of questions and writing reports .
MB : we set out a little while ago to try to go deep into the world -- and the throat -- of this beat@@ box@@ er extra@@ ordin@@ a@@ ire to try to understand how such a vast array of sounds are humanly possible .
so , if we can have the lights down ?
that &apos;s really remarkable .
( Laughter ) ( Beatboxing ) MB : alright .
I think it &apos;s a good idea .
this base has a lot of flaps in it .
this is a heart stent developed by Z@@ h@@ ong You at Oxford University .
and the algorithms that we developed to do insects turned out to be the solution for air@@ bags to do their simulation .
they both rip off their scru@@ bs , head to control consol@@ es 10 or 15 feet away , and Kri@@ sten just watches .
this was important news for surgeons , but I needed to know how widespread it was : where else was using AI blocking learning on the job ?
to find out , I &apos;ve connected with a small but growing group of young researchers who &apos;ve done boot@@ s-@@ on-the-@@ ground studies of work involving AI in very diverse settings like start-ups , policing , investment banking and online education .
and compared to instincts , conscious thought is pretty slow .
he also rules over the island &apos;s only earthly inhabit@@ ant , the de@@ jected and demon@@ ized Cali@@ ban .
when I get to my car , I throw everything on the back , and I just collapse into the driver &apos;s seat .
( Laughter ) Well , I &apos;m thinking in my mind , &quot; Je@@ ez , is this the response I &apos;m gonna get from everybody else ? &quot;
so I turned around and I looked at her , and I said , &quot; Are you gonna wear this ? &quot;
and in those autonomous lo@@ oms , he gained control .
they could &apos;ve just asked women about their experience .
and that &apos;s the story that I told a couple of years ago in my book , &quot; The Jour@@ ney of Man , &quot; and a film that we made with the same title .
and as we were finishing up that film -- it was co-@@ produced with National Geographic -- I started talking to the folks at NG about this work .
and yes , we have developed more selective drugs , but it &apos;s still a challenge to get them into the tumor , and they end up accumulating in the other organs as well or passing through your urine , which is a total waste .
so I ask you guys : if immune cells are already traveling to places of injury or disease in our bodies , why not add an extra passenger ?
Oh , the wrath of Photoshop .
we were a little bit ratt@@ led .
you need to know how to tell a story .
and that &apos;s when they ran into trouble .
and I said , &quot; Well , you know , that might be a bit ambitious for our budget . &quot;
James N@@ ach@@ twe@@ y , who was honored at last year &apos;s TED , took a look at the sweep of the medical system that is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq .
and she did this over the course of a couple of days , until the point where she got so frustrated with him that she started putting them directly on top of his head .
as a junior high school student , I hung out in the middle .
I thought about this while in medical school .
we break down the walls of our medical maze by taking the challenges of Medicaid patients , turning them into opportunities , and po@@ cke@@ ting the difference .
I call it social-@@ service arbit@@ rage .
your creativity bred out of you .
our weekly poetry series is transforming the lives of men incarcerated at D@@ ade Correc@@ tional , and we &apos;re so excited to bring you all the published work of one of those men , Echo Mar@@ tin@@ ez .
we were able to honor them for their commitment to radical tru@@ th-@@ telling .
I remember thinking that it was very strange that humans , who are an animal species among others , could be capable of changing the Earth &apos;s climate .
if there really was a crisis , and if this crisis was caused by our emissions , you would at least see some signs .
then , and only then , hope will come .
it &apos;s like , instead of going traveling , you look at someone else &apos;s travel photographs .
can we see it more visually ? yes , we can .
the speed with which galaxies within clusters are orbiting is much too large ; it must be embedded in dark matter .
but I think they feed each other , and they need each other .
Zoe : stop . LG : yeah .
right ?
so here , I grab -- you know this ? five of clubs ...
Zoe : the queen . LG : queen , yes .
do the cameras see the cards now ?
at this distance , it works immediately .
right ?
you bend down , you pat him -- you reward him for jumping up .
his one mistake is he &apos;s a Tibetan ma@@ stiff , and a few months later , he weighs , you know , 80 pounds .
and then we give him a reason for sitting .
basically , we follow a low-frequency behavior -- one the dog doesn &apos;t want to do -- by a high-frequency behavior , commonly known as a behavior problem , or a dog hobby -- something the dog does like to do .
we take the good for granted , and we mo@@ an and gro@@ an at the bad .
this should be taught in schools .

what you heard today was not perfect .
you want to hear it played by different musicians .
what we do have is the U.S.@@ -@@ enabled Leviathan Force that says , &quot; You want me to take that guy down ? I &apos;ll take that guy down .
you &apos;re America . &quot;
I used to give this brief inside the Pentagon in the early 1990s .
this is a concept which gets me vili@@ fied throughout the Pentagon .
but here &apos;s the promise you make to the American public , to your own people , to the world .
In@@ ter ag@@ enc@@ y-@@ ize it , inter@@ nation@@ alize it .
civil Affairs , that ba@@ stard child , comes over here .
just think about that , you know ?
you know , someone would come in with a list of the people who haven &apos;t paid school fees , and when they started getting pretty strict , you had to leave , until your school fees could be paid .
with two pay@@ checks , or three pay@@ checks , I could solve a lot of my family &apos;s problems .
there &apos;s a camera .
so , you can put circuit components on the staples , like a light bulb and a light switch .
now , this is just a single switch and you need half a billion for a computer , so we have a long way to go .
so , you can come up with a set of tiles that when they come together , form a little binary counter rather than a chec@@ ker@@ board .
so , this sort of recapit@@ ulates what I was telling you about development .
it &apos;s a molecular computer building an electronic computer .
the more I looked into this , I saw how this very real fear of violence , discrimination and this lack of acceptance caused so many of these patients to turn to alcohol and drugs .
she said , &quot; I love you regardless of who you are .
there &apos;s a huge gap in the education and training .
now , you may be thinking , &quot; Dr. Kri@@ sti@@ e , I have never questioned who I am .
I &apos;ve always known I was a girl , regardless of how I was as a kid .
if you don &apos;t speak up for your health care needs , no one &apos;s going to do it for you .
I think we can probably agree that it is hotter in summer than in winter , but why ? and finally , would you be able to -- and you can sort of scribble it , if you like -- scribble a plan diagram of the solar system , showing the shape of the planets &apos; orbits ?
now -- oh , oh yeah , go on then , go on .
( Laughter ) Einstein &apos;s especially interested in Pen@@ elope &apos;s talk .
E : &#91; bobbing head &#93; ( Laughter ) SW : let &apos;s get down for everybody . come on now .
Einstein : ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh .
E : I &apos;m special .
and this is something that we &apos;re very excited about .
so , we have actually -- are looking to turn the X PRIZE into a world-class prize institute .
and Mau@@ ch had no idea who was responsible for what was obviously an astonishing feat of architecture , but he felt sure of one single thing : this narrative needed to be claimed .
these narratives matter .
and he became hugely popular as the third intellectual leg of Old World learning , alongside Europe and Asia , as a peer .
but I never complained .
I had this giant poster of an allig@@ ator hanging on my bedroom wall .
one of the wrestlers who &apos;d been on the scene a long time knew what I was going through , and he came over to see how I was holding up .
( Laughter ) I found out that I was an OK wrest@@ ler , but I was an even better enter@@ tainer .
I was becoming the biggest version of myself in the ring , and other people took notice .
before I knew it , I &apos;d gone from wrestling maybe once a month in Minnesota to as often as four times a week all over the United States on the independent wrestling circuit .
I mean , do you know how many times she &apos;s had to remind me not to clo@@ the@@ s@@ line the refer@@ ees at my kid &apos;s soccer games ?
you never know what you have the ability to do until you dig .
( Applause )
and they would tell me knowingly , &quot; You &apos;ll change your mind . &quot;
the questions began to feel interro@@ gative .
but we haven &apos;t just done this in English .
but technology also creates completely new challenges when they ask us not to trust in other people but to trust in algorithms and computers .
and everyone who leaves you becomes an ambassador for not only your product , but who you are and how you operate .
I want you to shift your thinking to say , &quot; Think about the way it &apos;s going to be . &quot;
we started with sports .
he lost his contract with the 4@@ 9@@ ers , he was black@@ ball@@ ed by every NFL owner , he was criticized by millions and even the president of the United States decided to insult him .
but she wouldn &apos;t have any awareness of the ball , or any idea why she duc@@ ked .
luckily , there are things we can do right now , both individually and as a society , to better protect our health and give us more of the benefits of the sounds of silence .
they &apos;re less well-known , but they &apos;re just as dangerous as the auditory effects .
these are all likely reasons why studies have found that children who attend schools in noisy areas are more likely to lag behind their peers in academic performance .
RB : well , the good news is , people are finally asking the question .
so as AI investors , we often get phone calls from foundations or CEOs and boar@@ dro@@ oms saying , &quot; What do we do about this ? &quot;
anyone ?
not only had I traced my lost voice , but also had a choice to make myself useful .
yet the journey of finding my usefulness in this world served them in finding their usefulness to this world .
so it &apos;s about time that we talked about how the computer am@@ bus@@ hed television , or why the invention of the atomic bomb unleashed forces that lead to the writers &apos; strike .
Peter Hirsh@@ berg : which is more fun , Internet or TV ?
for 50 years , it &apos;s been about hopes and fears and promises of a better world . and I got to thinking , you know , who else talks that way ?
( video ) Narrator : the pyramids , the Colosseum , the New York subway system and TV dinners , ancient and modern wonders of the man-made world all .
the world and all its culture reduced to bits , the lingu@@ a fran@@ ca of all media .
it &apos;s the formidable thing that is changing entertainment now .
we &apos;re redesigning trees . we &apos;re redesigning flowers .
now , some people say , &quot; That &apos;s going to affect the environment in an extreme way , don &apos;t do it . &quot;
and why is this debate so complicated ?
he gave me a vial of what he &apos;s built about three weeks ago .
even the relics of seemingly happier times are described as cruci@@ fying the author : &quot; my husband and child smiling out of the family photo ; The@@ ir smiles catch onto my skin , little smiling hooks . &quot; her domestic dis@@ satisfaction and her husband &apos;s mistre@@ at@@ ment of her are constant themes in her later poetry .
as of now , our observations suggest that we &apos;re heading for a Big Free@@ ze .
and they &apos;ve managed to keep out the seis@@ mo@@ logists and the oil workers with spears and blow@@ guns .
and young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do .
and if we care about their future , we , as the elite around the world , we can do something about it . we can make choices as to how we live each day .
she was in the leadership in D@@ ar es Salaam .
I &apos;ll ask you to raise your hand , whether you are liberal , left of center -- on social issues , primarily -- or conservative .
let &apos;s start at the beginning : what is morality , where does it come from ?
a lot of it is ideas about purity , about what you &apos;re willing to touch or put into your body .
but as people get more conservative , the values rise .
it comes from his moral humility .
they set people off .
it actually means much worse than that , but that &apos;s what I &apos;m saying here .
and we knew it was volcanic back in the &apos; 60s , &apos; 70s .
you can see this shrimp is harassing this poor little guy here , and he &apos;ll bat it away with his claw . whack !
a lot of people hung up on us .
people told us nobody would do that , that it was too personal .
would our individual bills go down ?
how much of that do you think it would take to actually build a 10-@@ kil@@ ot@@ on bomb ?
and this is a real crisis for them .
about every 10 steps , they lean back and try to take a chunk out of your leg .
they use that to pinpoint sound .
Bedou@@ ins call the camel the Gi@@ ft of God .
so I think of -- we &apos;re kind of going from the out-of-@@ copyright , library stuff , and Amazon@@ .com is coming from the in-@@ print world .
and I think we &apos;ll meet in the middle some place , and have the classic thing that you have , which is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel .
and then , there &apos;s business model issues about how to try to effectively market it and get it to people .
if we go and put it in a couple more places , I think we &apos;ll be in good shape .
and that meant that everyone in the family had to sign up to take her to have her hair dyed , you know , that peculiar color of blue that matches her polye@@ ster pants suit , you know , same color as the Bu@@ ick .
because now she &apos;s picked up the Highway 2@@ 85 , the perimeter around Atlanta , which encompasses now -- there &apos;s seven lanes , she &apos;s on all of them , y &apos;all .
that &apos;s OK , because my mother y@@ ells at me , I yell at her .
and the reason this is happening , by and large , is because of our food system and the way the government commodi@@ fies food , the way the government over@@ sees our food , the way the USDA puts food on kids &apos; plates that &apos;s unhealthy , and allows unhealthy food into schools .
we can &apos;t keep feeding our kids pesticides and herb@@ icides and antibiotics and hormones .
Seventy percent of all antibiotics consumed in America is consumed in animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
and that is what the USDA allows in our food supply .
it &apos;s because of the way the government commodi@@ fies food , and the cheap corn and cheap soy that are pushed into our food supply that makes these non-@@ nutrient foods really , really cheap .
those are the recipes that the kids learn in my cooking classes .
I &apos;m fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility , so I get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction .
you could neglect me .
and I took my bike into the bike store@@ -- I love this -- same bike , and they &apos;d do something called &quot; tru@@ ing &quot; the wheels .
so I first went to Copenhagen because I thought , well , maybe I could become a bio@@ chemist , but I discovered biochemistry was very boring .
and there I met Francis Crick .
and the reason for doing so , at the center of this photograph , is Linus Paul@@ ing . about six months before , he proposed the alpha heli@@ cal structure for proteins . and in doing so , he banished the man out on the right , Sir Lawrence Bra@@ g@@ g , who was the Ca@@ ven@@ dish professor .
and I think part of the reason she didn &apos;t want to build models was , she wasn &apos;t a chemist , whereas Paul@@ ing was a chemist .
so this same technique should probably look at all .
I thank you .
so I used to work at Mat@@ tel , actually .
and then , I made a Lego animator .
and I started working on this project -- oh , I have to tell you about this real quick .
and I started working with So@@ lid Works and a whole other group to do that .
so full circle -- why do I do this ?
so you see -- hey , come on . Hey , did you feel that ?
we have one animator who &apos;s taken it and he &apos;s done a take on the Bud@@ we@@ is@@ er beer commercial , and they &apos;re going , &quot; W@@ has@@ su@@ p , &quot; you know ?
one nice problem is , what do we do about health ?
you throw everything else away . you become a mon@@ om@@ ani@@ ac -- all you care about is not stepping out on that platform .
overall , of all the things that you have to do , what is the single most important thing the VC is going to be investing in ?
next : knowledge .
I know the day , I know who I am -- I don &apos;t need all that .
you &apos;ve noticed I &apos;m not looking at the screen , right ?
number five : always use presenter mode , or O@@ vation , or presenter tools .
but the thing is , if we can get out there as individuals and talk to people , so we can remove their apathy and make sure that they can vote .
then she looked into all of the finances of the water district and found there was 250,000 dollars missing from their bank account .
( Laughter ) Because we know there is a difference , right ?
we say , &quot; Yes , we can ! &quot;
these new fossils disrupt everything we thought we knew about these trends and force us to change the way that we think about human evolution .
( Laughter ) But words can hardly convey my excitement when I was chosen as an early career scientist by Lee Ber@@ ger , a world-renowned paleo@@ anthropologist , to be one of the primary analysts of recently excavated unpublished fossils .
in modern humans , the third mol@@ ar is typically the smallest , while the first mol@@ ar is the biggest , but Homo nal@@ edi has the primitive condition where the third mol@@ ar is the biggest and the first mol@@ ar is the smallest .
in fact , when I compare the outlines , when I lay them on top of each other , they look very similar .
with its small brain and flar@@ ed pelvis , we would not have been surprised if the fossils turned out to be two million years old .
two friendly bears ?
now he had empirical measures to quantify all kinds of test takers : the creative and imaginative , the deta@@ il-@@ oriented , the big-@@ picture percei@@ vers , and flexible participants able to adapt their approach .
and you can see huge areas of cortex where there are massive correlations in the distribution of gray matter .
as you can see , there are two inventors with identical contrap@@ tions in their lap , meeting in the waiting room of a patent attorney .
whereas , if we &apos;re born with certain instincts , then perhaps some of them might condem@@ n us to selfishness , prejudice and violence .
Bar@@ nett New@@ man had a famous quote that &quot; the impulse of modern art is the desire to destroy beauty &quot; -- which was considered bour@@ geo@@ is or tac@@ ky .
I think anyone who &apos;s recently been a parent can sympath@@ ize with this mother .
the choice is whether certain facts about humans , or topics , are to be considered taboos , forbidden knowledge , where we shouldn &apos;t go there because no good can come from it , or whether we should explore them honestly .
it actually is a nursing home .
we see that we have waiting lists in the nursing homes .
dementia is a disease that affects the brain .
their daily rhythm starts later in the day , ends later in the day .
and that &apos;s what we started .
I often saw them walking around outside .
but there was also counter-@@ research going on on the other side , the design of portable draw@@ bridges that you could bring right up to the wall and allow vehicles to drive right over .
well , this gets rid of that , because this is a habituation Ga@@ us@@ sian that gets negative , and more and more intense as it looks at one thing .
they first make eye contact , and then , when Christi@@ e looks over at this toy , the robot estimates her gaze direction and looks at the same thing that she &apos;s looking at .
and that &apos;s sort of like this lone guy in the backyard , you know -- &quot; I accidentally built a 747 . &quot;
however , to other people , the idea of consent is so strongly tied to sex , and sex is often considered a taboo subject , that it made them very uncomfortable .
( Laughter ) And when you live in a free country , there &apos;s this tendency of assuming that those who are oppressed tolerate their oppression or are comfortable with it , and democracy is projected as a progressive form of governance in such a way that those people who don &apos;t live under democratic countries are seen as people who are not intellectually or maybe morally as advanced as others .
and a friend of mine in Austria felt so sorry for me that he talked the largest cas@@ ino owner in Lin@@ z into letting us wrap his building .
the fear that automation might displace workers and potentially lead to lots of unemployment goes back at a minimum 200 years to the Lu@@ dd@@ ite revol@@ ts in England .
so clearly , a much more sophisticated , thin@@ k@@ ing-@@ like approach is needed .
and make no mistake -- that &apos;s a lot of jobs .
the Colombian armed conflict is finally coming to an end , but the consequences of years of war are still buried under our feet .
the siege , the wars , the bombs , the protests or the death toll .
so , it &apos;s lighter , it &apos;s cheaper , and it &apos;s stronger .
but each unit costs around 350 dollars .
if we were to print out all three billion A &apos;s , T &apos;s , C &apos;s and G &apos;s on a standard font , standard format , and then we were to stack all of those papers , it would be about 130 meters high , somewhere between the Statue of Liberty and the Washington Mon@@ u@@ ment .
now , if we converted all those A &apos;s , T &apos;s , C &apos;s and G &apos;s to digital data , to zeroes and ones , it would total a few gigs .
it &apos;s the first-ever photo of DNA , taken about 60 years ago .
so really , our understanding of digital storage and of DNA have co@@ evolved .
so once we decided what sort of files we want to encode , we package up the data , convert those zeroes and ones to A &apos;s , T &apos;s , C &apos;s and G &apos;s , and then we just send this file off to a synthesis company .
in fact , he himself never went to school .
we could build large machines , so-called artificial trees , that will scru@@ b CO2 from the air .
while counter@@ acting ocean acidification is a good thing , we don &apos;t fully understand what the environmental consequences are , and so we need to assess whether this treatment is actually better than the disease that it is seeking to cure .
and actually , there are reasons science disliked the gut for a long time ; I have to say this .
real cleanliness is a bit different .
now , what to do ?
the 3@@ 4,000 kinds of fishes .
and what you see is -- actually , the red dotted line shows the track of this performing element , which was a new piece that created -- that we created for the -- which was a robotic drill , basically , that went all the way around , cru@@ ised the museum , went all around the walls and did a lot of damage .
it &apos;s Alice Tul@@ ly Hall , and it &apos;s tucked under the Juilliard Building and descends several levels under the street .
this feather has enabled birds to conquer gravity and take to the air in an extraordinary way .
so we came up with mobile phone applications that you can use on your iPhone and on your Android phone , and we made them freely available for every bir@@ d-@@ watching enthusi@@ ast out there .
much science fiction features white male heroes who blast aliens or become savi@@ ors of brown people .
what about electricity , roads and running water ?
today we know : half of the world &apos;s children by 2030 will be failing to learn .
and what deeply worries me -- if children go to school and don &apos;t learn , it de@@ values education , and it de@@ values spending on education , so that governments and political parties can say , &quot; Oh , we are spending so much money on education , but children are not learning .
because of this , climat@@ ologists are predicting that the area burned since 2000 will double or triple in the next three decades .
instead of putting all the fires out , we need to put some of them back to work thinning forests and reducing dead fuels .
we dance ( Music ) We dance , we make the club our own We chant at night to free our souls We dance , we make the club our home -- TM : can you guys clap with us ?

( Applause and cheers )
now , let &apos;s take an example .
I can ignore that .
the Pro@@ Publi@@ ca reporter spent about 30 dollars to target this category .
carrying the blood of her people in her veins , ad@@ or@@ ned with the teachings , ways , even the land on her very skin , B@@ int@@ i leaves the earth .
as the story progresses , she becomes not other , but more .
these communities in these cities are actually more vital than the illegal communities .
so , that &apos;s just a rock in the hillside .
and in the two years since that phone call , my life has completely changed .
so there &apos;s a lot more female gamers than people are really aware .
I &apos;m not sure what the implications of my experience are , but the potential for using realistic video game stimuli in repetition on a vast number of loyal participants is frightening to me .
we filmed the experiment , and it became instantly viral .
some of my biggest dreams are nightmares .
but it also gives them an opportunity to share something with the court that goes beyond their criminal record and their charges .
my dad &apos;s been sick for a decade , but three years ago he got really sick , and we had to move him out of his house -- the house that I grew up in , the house that he built with his own hands .
and it &apos;s supposed to be practical , but to me it looked like a straight@@ jacket .
what does my best death look like ?
what does your best death look like ?
and in that moment I realized I &apos;m not responsible for this person .
so by the &apos; 90s , believe it or not , they were actually self-sufficient in food , but they did it at a great cost .
it &apos;s not only the US military that understands this .
and in fact , in 2014 , I was honored to speak for a half-@@ a-@@ day seminar at the International Se@@ apo@@ wer Symp@@ os@@ ium to 70 heads of navi@@ es about this issue .
so Winston Churchill is alleged to have said , I &apos;m not sure if he said anything , but he &apos;s alleged to have said that Americans can always be counted upon to do the right thing after exhausting every other possibility .
this is my ask .
if you live in a city , and even if you live in a slum -- which 20 percent of the world &apos;s urban population does -- you &apos;re likely to be healthier , wealthier , better educated and live longer than your country cousins .
now obviously , some cities are more fragile than others .
there , we &apos;re seeing fragility rising way beyond scales we &apos;ve ever seen before .
but they can do a lot more than that .
you see , Seoul &apos;s population doubled over the last 30 years , but the footprint barely changed .
( Laughter ) Brother number two was a little bit more skeptical .
but if the arts contributes this much to our economy , why then do we still invest so little in arts and artists ?
I think that there is effectively a new kind of model of interactivity that &apos;s starting to emerge online right now .
and so the question is , &quot; Why is this happening ? &quot;
so in a sense , bur@@ sty we@@ blogs coming from new voices .
so the most amazing thing about this -- and I &apos;ll end on this note -- is , most emergent systems , most self-organizing systems are not made up of component parts that are capable of looking at the overall pattern and changing their behavior based on whether they like the pattern or not .
and despite my initial low expectations about hearing about this model , they were having an astonishing success rate : 85 percent were still housed after 12 months .
now , those of us that attended the conference said , &quot; Yeah , these models will work in Utah . &quot;
and it &apos;s not helpful to look at somebody with this start in life and blame them for where they are .
when people have been living on the street for many years , moving back into housing requires lots of things to learn .
but they echo each other in the details , such as the re@@ appearing head that also re@@ surfaces in &quot; P@@ P@@ CD . &quot;
these photons will then impact an array of paired radiation detectors in the scanner walls .
these practices have spread to other cultures , where people are creating their own versions of glaciers and applying them to solve serious modern challenges around water supplies .
I didn &apos;t meet anybody who hadn &apos;t been part of thousands of deliveries .
and the thing is , it works .
everyone .
( Laughter ) And it became the way that sports works .
we found some incredible partners , including the government of India , and we ran a trial there in 120 birth centers .
I put the time stamp on here so you could see how quickly all of this happens and how much more complicated that makes things .
I mean , we &apos;re still in a place in which we &apos;re far , far behind what looks like the real world in actu@@ ality .
so what do you think is going to happen as we go on ?
the idea that there &apos;s sort of an equ@@ al@@ izer happening , that sort of means that anybody can make something , is wonderful .
I do think that there are going to be different ways , but I don &apos;t know necessarily .
and instead of you watching a television screen , you &apos;re sitting there next to him , and he &apos;s having this conversation .
he had a huge ambition .
as a result he became obsessed with the thought that when we die our life is swept away -- dust to dust .
your honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence .
but instead , surprisingly , he said , &quot; Oh , bring her down here for a year , and if I can &apos;t win her over , no one can . &quot;
and all these stories became part of his memory bank , so he could call on them whenever he needed to .
( Applause ) Thank you .
I was standing in the toilet because I couldn &apos;t even sit down , because the toilet roll had run out , there was mud everywhere , and it smelled pretty bad .
introverts , my call to action for you is , I know you like being on your own , I know you like being in your head , but activism needs you , so sometimes you &apos;ve got to get out there .
( Applause ) AGF : virtual or otherwise .
and this is something I would like to draw attention to again , to our education system .
we have to do away with this rote learning .
when we talk about the contribution from countries of the north to the Green Fund for the protection of our planet , it is not charity .
they &apos;ve been around since the 1980s .
this one was invented in 1988 by a Facebook Fel@@ low called Yan@@ n Le@@ Cu@@ n , and it propag@@ ates data stages through what you could think of as the human brain .
what my student team at Stanford has shown is that if you train it on 12@@ 9,000 images of skin conditions , including melanoma and carcin@@ om@@ as , you can do as good a job as the best human dermatologists .
it &apos;s much harder to put something out that &apos;s ethical .
it can &apos;t even control a motorcycle .
it &apos;s been in legal document discovery .
we can swim across the Atlantic in 11 hours .
suffra@@ gists kept up steady pressure on their representatives , attended rallies , and peti@@ tioned the White House .
so then at the next level , we have rich white people .

when D started school here he was six years old : cute as a button , with a smile that bri@@ ghten@@ ed the entire room .
and everyone benef@@ itted because our teachers got access to the latest college-@@ level thinking , and those college students got real-world , life experiences in the classroom .
or &quot; How can I help you ? &quot; instead of &quot; Get out . &quot;
I &apos;m happy to say that when D got to fourth grade , he rarely got into trouble .
we were making the mistake of thinking that a planet was always going to look like a planet .
we played with new ideas .
at the time , I didn &apos;t realize how much music was helping me .
and that means that I have to frequently excuse myself from my classroom , because my verbal tics can be extremely distracting .
and my answer is , the most important thing we need to do is to forget about there being any single thing that is the most important thing we need to do .
but you find essentially the same results , namely , that after a certain basic point -- which corresponds more or less to just a few 1,000 dollars above the minimum poverty level -- increases in material well-being don &apos;t seem to affect how happy people are .
for instance , this is another student of mine , Susan Jackson from Australia , who did work with some of the leading athletes in the world .
and you may be doing things very differently from other people , but for everyone that flow channel , that area there , will be when you are doing what you really like to do -- play the piano , be with your best friend , perhaps work , if work is what provides flow for you .
so for the other 84 percent , this may seem like a new topic .
we deliver our customers &apos; orders in as fast as three hours on electric vehicles , and we use biodegradable , reusable boxes to minimize our environmental footprint .
as trees grow taller and taller , the supply of these vital fluids begins to d@@ win@@ dle .
and what I found out is that it &apos;s an epidemic across the world .
it was the scariest moment of my life ; an excruciating choice to make .
we went to dinner , and in the back seat of a car , he suddenly lun@@ ged on top of me and stuck his tongue down my throat .
&quot; women make it up . &quot;
time Magazine calls it , right there on the screen , &quot; The teeny tiny little print in contracts that keeps sexual harassment claims unheard . &quot;
let &apos;s hire back all those women whose careers were lost because of some random jerk .
I &apos;m M@@ ai@@ sie Williams .
the six of us made an office in D@@ om &apos;s garden , and on August 1 , 2018 , we released our version one .
when I left school about seven years ago , I made it my mission to continue learning even though I never wanted to set foot in a classroom again .
all of those hospitals only receive blood in this way , and most of those hospitals actually place multiple orders every day .
because doctors can get what they need instantly , they actually stock less blood at the hospitals .
over the next few years as we start serving private health care facilities , we &apos;ll also use that mobile payment platform to collect fees for deliveries .
one thing that people , I think , often miss is that these kinds of leaps generate compounding gains .
you may have noticed I left something out of the video that I showed you .
we also don &apos;t have run@@ ways where we operate .
well , it &apos;s pretty good .
and so the method that arose organically within the community is the V@@ otes For D@@ ele@@ tion page .
the rest of physics is about describing what can happen and what can &apos;t .
now , it turns out the electric charge is actually a combination of two other charges : hyper@@ charge and weak charge .
we can also include two more charges corresponding to the gravitational force .
this is the way theories of unification work .
if the LHC finds new particles , but they don &apos;t fit this pattern -- well , that will be very interesting , but bad for this E8 theory .
their similar social structure made it easy to integrate with human families and learn to understand their commands .
of course , none of these technologies would be as helpful as simply looking deep inside the earth itself .
they have families , they talk , and they plan their activities .
this is a video of real bacteria du@@ eling with sword@@ like organ@@ elles , where they try to kill each other by literally stab@@ bing and rup@@ turing each other .
it takes seven days today to manufacture a chair , but you know what ? one day it will take seven hours .
some designers don &apos;t design objects , products , things that we &apos;re going to actually use , but rather , they design scenarios that are objec@@ t-based .
Eli@@ o C@@ ac@@ cav@@ ale : he took the idea of those dolls that explain leukemia .
and many designers have been working recently on the idea of death and mourning , and what we can do about it today with new technologies .
or how we should behave about it with new technologies .
and yet we know that this indicator species is dying off .
we &apos;re moving on .
( Laughter ) The habitat hypothesis .
Pro@@ vin@@ ce@@ town honey goes from 1@@ 16 plants in the spring to over 200 plants in the summer .
do they have less or more plants in suburban areas with lawns that look nice for people but they &apos;re terrible for pollinators ?
when we take this information to governments , we can do amazing things .
what are we going to do about this , our precious land ?
I &apos;m collaborating with S@@ war@@ ov@@ ski , the crystal company .
these are Cur@@ rent Windows , where we replaced all windows in a gallery in London , in So@@ ho , with this modern version of stained glass .
an elderly couple came walking down the street .
but what was stranger still -- and even I realized it at the time , as a nine-year-old child -- was that they stopped at all .
I looked into their strangely angry faces , and I remember wondering , are they wearing rubber masks ?
the old man reached out his kno@@ b@@ bly claw for the woman &apos;s hand , and found it , and left me alone .
and they would go , &quot; Why would we do this ?
and just as happens in the Nevada desert , though in slightly different temperatures , the people of this community , 65,000 of them , turned out to write their grief , their pain , their hope , their hopes for the future , their love .
and that narrative is so appealing even to me , and I thought maybe I had gotten that , too , but I didn &apos;t .
but still , glamour is an illusion .
and I don &apos;t know who she is either , but this is the &#91; 16th &#93; century equivalent of a super@@ model .
&quot; to conce@@ al all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort &quot; : and this is one of the critical aspects of glamour .
glamour is about editing .
and the answer is no , but of course it &apos;s really just a movie .
the perfect ge@@ taway in your perfect car .
is it something important ?
David H@@ oc@@ k@@ ney talks about how the appreciation of this very glamorous painting is heightened if you think about the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash , which only took a fraction of a second to happen .
and , actually , you get more appreciation for glamour when you realize what went into creating it .
this is about changing long@@ standing negative perceptions and building self-@@ advocacy .
and he writes , &quot; Can you tell me what you think of all the head traumas I &apos;ve dealt with ?
it &apos;s important , but not enough , because we doctors do what we get paid to do and trained to do what we get paid to do , so if we change insurance , then we change medical practice and medical education .
but when you change those behaviors , your brain gets more blood , you think more clearly , have more energy , your heart gets more blood , as I &apos;ve shown you .
the fiber fills you up before you get too many calories and it slows the absorption , so you don &apos;t get that rapid rise in blood sugar .
and in order for the P@@ SA to go down , they had to make big changes .
but also , through mechanisms that we don &apos;t fully understand , people who are lonely and depressed are many times -- three to five to ten times in some studies -- more likely to get sick and die prematurely .
but by the time those two kids are ready to start kindergarten , we know that the child living in poverty is likely to have cognitive scores that are , on average , 60 percent lower than those of the other child .
the list can be overwhelming .
doctors said it was a cardiac arr@@ hyth@@ mia that was secondary to heart failure .
but that beli@@ es two remarkable attributes .
the second is they can differentiate or become more specialized , so these simple little round cells can turn into skin , can turn into brain , can turn into kidney and so forth .
it should have been a victorious moment@@ - he had just opened his very own medicine shop .
when Bai Su Zhen opened her eyes , she realized immediately what must have happened .
she rode to the mountains on a cloud , then continued on foot passed gate@@ ways and arch@@ es until she reached one marked &quot; beyond mortals &quot; hanging over a silver bridge .
when he opened his eyes , the terrified look frozen on his face became a smile .
I kept thinking to myself , &quot; Why does he hate me ?
she &apos;s from Sweden , and a few years ago , she really became -- she has Asperger &apos;s , and she became passionate about our climate crisis -- learned everything about it .
so it &apos;s a new reality , and these old , sort of hierarchical ways to think about things , they &apos;re increasingly coming under pressure in this reality .
and I don &apos;t know a single leader today who will not listen to a concern that many of their employees hold .
every 25 years I do a picture . here &apos;s the one -- tries to show that the world isn &apos;t getting any bigger .
things are going on this decade , next decade ; it &apos;s a very short time that we have to decide what we are going to do .
that all sounds impressive , and it is , but look at the body of the winning robot , H@@ U@@ BO .
and indeed , this worked surprisingly well , quite honestly , much better than I expected .
maybe we can call that &quot; robotics for anti@@ aging &quot; or even a next stage of human evolution .
so I began to be an ar@@ dent student of technology trends , and track where technology would be at different points in time , and began to build the mathematical models of that .
processor performance on Intel chips , the average price of a transistor -- 1968 , you could buy one transistor for a dollar .
you could buy 10 million in 2002 .
you would think it would be a very er@@ ratic process , and you have a very smooth outcome of this chaotic process .
unlike Gertrude Stein &apos;s roses , it &apos;s not the case that a transistor is a transistor .
if you have 50 percent defl@@ ation , people may increase their volume 30 , 40 percent , but they won &apos;t keep up with it . &quot;
the Internet has been doubling in power and continues to , measured many different ways .
they both empower our promise and our peril .
there is a SUDEP every seven to nine minutes .
and with these wear@@ ables , we started to collect the first-ever clinical quality data 24-@@ 7 .
when an MIT student is working hard in the lab or on home@@ works , there is not only emotional stress , but there &apos;s cognitive load , and it turns out that cognitive load , cognitive effort , mental engagement , excitement about learning something -- those things also make the signal go up .
this sweat@@ band has inside it a home@@ built sk@@ in-@@ conductance sensor , and one day , one of our undergrads knocked on my door right at the end of the December semester , and he said , &quot; Professor Pic@@ ard , can I please borrow one of your wrist@@ band sensors ?
he says , &quot; It &apos;s interesting .
though muscle cells use up ATP as they contract repeatedly , they are always making more , so most of the time even heavily fatigued muscles still have not depleted this energy source .
investors may be worried about changes in leadership , bad publicity , or larger factors like new laws and trade policies .
( Laughter ) St@@ ars go here , trucks go here .
but then you have the grandparents on the other side , who don &apos;t put their final affairs in order , who don &apos;t get rid of all the junk they &apos;ve been ho@@ arding for decades and decades and leave their kids to deal with it .
so the US has a very individu@@ alist culture -- go it alone .
and are you willing to see things even when it &apos;s not what you want ?
but we have the opportunity and the ability to correct those blind spots .
how much control do you feel that you have over the gray rhinos in your life ?
think of climate change , it can feel so big , that not a single one of us could make a difference .
but we have an opportunity to change .
I talked about how my sisters and I watched our mother suffer years of abuse at the hands of our step@@ father , escaping , only to find ourselves living in a shelter .
but most of all , they were good students .
for instance , this is Her@@ bert with his grandmother .
in fact , we can thank this generation for the term &quot; work@@ aholic . &quot;
and in fact , this idea of generations has become deeply embedded in United States culture .
when we talk generations , people know exactly what we &apos;re talking about .
the put pictures on the walls of the ideal multigenerational workplace , because if you can see it , you can be it .
we know 20-@@ year-olds and 60-@@ year-olds go home and do different things .
because this can and must change .
the Reynolds number is useful for understanding simple scenarios , but it &apos;s ineffective in many situations .
he works on mostly music videos and commercials with his company , The Direc@@ tors Bureau .
Aqu@@ a Roc@@ ket : coming this summer .
ZK : so now , when we dream up these concepts , it &apos;s important for us to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint .
the force of the water rushing down , in addition to that re@@ pulsion force , would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market .
( Applause ) So what &apos;s the significance of this dry liquid ?
KS : so that was the six we had for you today , but I hope you &apos;re starting to see why we find these things so fascinating .
what have you done with so many years of being away ?
what happens with that ?
so I have one message .
the problem with it is -- and the reason I will never build another one like it -- is that this is a product of two-dimensional thinking .
but to me , Sophie is a fantastic feat of bioengineering .
in there , she has a pair of venom glands that are attached to a pair of fangs , and those fangs are folded into her mouth .
e-cigarettes can expose teens to a lot of nicotine .
do smokers really need 15,000 ki@@ d-@@ friendly flavors to quit smoking ?
23 are blue , 33 are purple , and 43 are red .
when all the eggs have combined into a single egg , the creature that hat@@ ches will bond with you on sight , which is why getting a Cu@@ ddly is so important .
now , I like in an audience , in Britain especially , to talk about the comparison with fo@@ x@@ hunting , which is something that was banned after a long struggle , by the government not very many months ago .
a very simple definition .
there are fundamental , major breakthroughs , and there are incremental refin@@ ements of those breakthroughs .
I decided to give this a little name , which is &quot; longevity escape velocity . &quot;
so , in other words , we add two years -- we tre@@ ble their remaining lifespan , starting from the point that we started the therapies .
the public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are .
this list is just for illustration ; it is incomplete .
so , these seven things were all under discussion in ger@@ ontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news , because it means that , you know , we &apos;ve come a long way in biology in these 20 years , so the fact that we haven &apos;t extended this list is a pretty good indication that there &apos;s no extension to be done .
however , it &apos;s better than that ; we actually know how to fix them all , in mice , in principle -- and what I mean by in principle is , we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade .
Thank you .
if I project that , that would make me think that I would live until 120 if I don &apos;t crash on my motor@@ bike .
voice 1 : yeah . it &apos;s coming again .
OK , the first question : what do they tell us about why people do things ?
and then I would launch in .
&quot; what was that about , &quot; I &apos;m saying . what was that about ?
but as they learn to become adults , they become much more sensitive to the opinions of others , and they lose that freedom and they do start to become embarrassed .
that &apos;s great . if you could pass it up . thanks , David , I appreciate it .
life &apos;s complicated ; we want to figure out what &apos;s going on around us very quickly .
so that ability just to go for it and explore lots of things , even if they don &apos;t seem that different from each other , is actually something that kids do well , and it is a form of play .
and all of a sudden a productive conversation was happening about design around a tangible object .
so when , as adults , we role-play , then we have a huge set of these scripts already internalized .
so we &apos;re very good , when acting out a solution , at spotting whether something lacks authenticity .
well , imagine if you did the same task with friends while you were drinking in a pub .
they transition in and out of it , and good teachers spend a lot of time thinking about how to move kids through these experiences .
and then will come what they call the heart , the lush heart note .
this actually is roughly , in man-@@ years of work , 200,000 dollars roughly , if you keep them on the low salaries with no benefits .
you &apos;re right , and I don &apos;t care how you do it , in a sense ; you bring me the molecules , you know .
when I got there , I was just a bit taken ab@@ ack , because the last time I went to E@@ bb@@ w V@@ ale , it looked like this .
and it came to a head when I met this young man in front of the sports center .
but there was nothing there .
and maybe you think , &quot; Well , it was just a bit of over@@ spending .
and we know it &apos;s the same people , the same companies , the same data , the same techniques , the same use of hate and fear .
because 100 years ago , the biggest danger in the South Wales coal mines was gas .
where something is , is defined with respect to this last sphere , the celestial sphere , outside of which is this eternal , perfect realm , where lives God , who is the ultimate judge of everything .
it &apos;s meaningful to say absolutely where something is in space , because that &apos;s defined , not with respect to say , where other things are , but with respect to this absolute notion of space , which for Newton was God .
so these are all dynamics that we were not expecting 13 years ago when we were starting the company .
JD : yeah , I mean , I think you &apos;re spot on , but that goes back to the incentives .
was that the right decision at the time ?
and in the same way that you have indicators and we have indicators as humans in terms of are we healthy or not , such as temperature , the flus@@ h@@ ness of your face , we believe that we could find the indicators of conversational health .
so , are we seeing filter bubbles or echo chambers , or are we actually getting a variety of opinions within the conversation ?
so that means push more towards technology , rather than humans doing the work -- that means the humans receiving the abuse and also the humans having to review that work .
are you willing to sacrifice user time , if need be , to go for a more reflective conversation ?
there are something like 500 high school chapters devoted to stopping the genocide in Darfur .
the issues were , of course , ethnic sectarian violence .

SD : you &apos;ll see here that some light from behind it gets len@@ sed , and some light does a lo@@ op-@@ the-@@ loop around the entire orbit of the black hole .

&quot; it &apos;s O@@ PP , time for other people &apos;s what you get it there &apos;s no room for relationship , there &apos;s just room to ... &quot;

and children with progeria are born with a T at a single position in their genome where you have a C , with the devastating consequence that these wonderful , bright kids age very rapidly and pass away by about age 14 .
we think of bacteria as sources of infection , but bacteria themselves are also prone to being infected , in particular , by viruses .
remarkable researchers including Em@@ manu@@ elle Char@@ p@@ enti@@ er , George Church , Jennifer Dou@@ d@@ na and F@@ en@@ g Z@@ hang showed six years ago how CRISPR scissors could be programmed to cut DNA sequences of our choosing , including sequences in your genome , instead of the viral DNA sequences chosen by bacteria .
and while we can sometimes introduce new DNA sequences into cells to replace the DNA sequences surrounding a cut site , that process , unfortunately , doesn &apos;t work in most types of cells , and the disrupted gene outcomes still pre@@ dominate .
but even at this point , our work was only half done .
as I said , they were adventurous people .
so , that gives you a kind of flavor of the kind of people we have there .
recently from one of our satellites , this shows that it &apos;s Earth-like -- we caught a landslide occurring as it was happening .
this is one very large crater . geologists love craters , because craters are like digging a big hole in the ground without really working at it , and you can see what &apos;s below the surface .
what is that ?
Rob Gro@@ ver : friction really starts to build up on the spacecraft , and we use the friction when it &apos;s flying through the atmosphere to our advantage to slow us down .
BC : we &apos;ve lost 99 percent of our entry velocity .
over a year-long period , participants lose an average of five pounds .
and so ...
and that you can take a trait that you know from one plant and put it in another plant , and you can make a prediction that it &apos;ll do the same thing .
I &apos;m a biologist , so that &apos;s why I &apos;m proposing a solution to the climate change problem that really involves the best evolved organism on earth to do it -- plants .
but the benefits of this program extend beyond food .
and it is .
( Laughter ) What we &apos;re looking forward to is -- ( Applause ) what we &apos;re looking forward to is not only the inspiration of our children , but the current plan right now is not really even allowing the most creative people in this country -- the Boeing &apos;s and Loc@@ k@@ heed &apos;s space engineers -- to go out and take risks and try new stuff .
and this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now . we thought there &apos;d be animals there ; we knew there were plants there ; the colors change , right ?

circuit boards of the future .
water li@@ lies were among the first .
and where water is liquid , it becomes a womb for cells green with chlor@@ ophy@@ ll -- and that molecular marvel is what &apos;s made a difference -- it powers everything .
and now , I &apos;ll count to three . I mean , it still looks very orderly to me .
but it &apos;s a very good example to see that the whole work was more of a handic@@ raft endeavor that involved the very time-consuming job of cutting out the various elements and sticking them back in new arrangements .
does the white bull represent Spain , the country of mat@@ ad@@ ors and a common theme in Picasso &apos;s work@@ - or does it stand for the brutality of war ?
but even without a close understanding of it &apos;s complicated sub@@ text , Picasso &apos;s work remains a sear@@ ing reminder of the true casualties of violence .
that &apos;s just a bit a joke , there .
( Laughter ) I just couldn &apos;t work it out , I could not understand it .
the year after my grandmother &apos;s death was the most intensely creative of my life .
I &apos;m almost dead inside up here .
and at that point , I realized that I &apos;d been telling my stories for laughs .
and if the experience of &quot; Nan@@ ette &quot; taught me anything , it &apos;s that connection depends not just on me .
how do you study a mountain for the kinds of things we &apos;re talking about ?
you may recognize a couple of the miners there .
it &apos;s called the Bon@@ anza Ad@@ it . it &apos;s down in a canyon .

Mil@@ ver@@ ton N@@ wo@@ ke@@ di : you cut a nice movie with just 10,000 dollars in Nigeria here .
come on . don &apos;t run away . come back . come back .
W@@ at , wait . just hold this for me .
we didn &apos;t have to tell to the Nigerian filmmakers .
CA : and these aren &apos;t films that are primarily seen in cin@@ em@@ as ?
this is a star , this is a star , everything else is a galaxy , OK ?
but if we were capable to come up with an idea of how to look even further -- there &apos;s some things even further , and that was what I did in a lot of my work , was to develop the techniques -- we could look out back to even earlier epo@@ chs before there were stars and before there were galaxies , back to when the universe was hot and dense and very different .
so the way these measurements were done , there &apos;s been a set of satellites , and this is where you get to see .
so again , you can see the extension of this Great Wall of galaxies showing up here .
we &apos;re going to zoom in , but this is a plot of what it is .
notice this pattern and pay attention to this pattern .
and so here we are .
and so the idea is , you know , how would you put together the universe in a very simple way ?
and you see how the dark matter lu@@ mps up , and the ordinary matter just trails along behind .
rods of hemoglobin cause the cell to de@@ form into a long , pointed sickle .
sick@@ led cells sna@@ g and pile up@@ - sometimes blocking the vessel completely .
we can know what the computers are going to be like in 2020 .
and so we asked ourselves , you know , can we find innovative things that will go fill these gaps ? and Bro@@ oks told me in a break here , he said he &apos;s found so much stuff he can &apos;t sleep , because there &apos;s so many great technologies out there , we &apos;re essentially buried . and we need them , you know .
we have a new prototype that we &apos;re showing here , for the first time at TED , and here &apos;s how it works .

pretty good , right , pretty good .
the world of things is much bigger than the world of technology .
what is the platform going to be ?
now you cannot connect things directly to the cloud , obviously .
a father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall .
so this is a call , a plea , to the incredibly talented TED community .
my roll call of hal@@ lowed deeds includes abolition , women &apos;s suffrage , the civil rights movement , the Al@@ lied landing at Nor@@ man@@ dy , the fall of the Berlin Wall .
it &apos;s called &quot; Civic Saturday , &quot; and it follows the arc of a faith gathering .
it speaks to a basic human yearning for face-to-face fellowship .
( Laughter ) I &apos;ve been documenting the strange lives of the world &apos;s slow@@ est mammal for the last 10 years .
head injuries are bad for you . they lead to Parkinson &apos;s disease .
they also have the ability to put roots anywhere in the tree itself .
I hadn &apos;t even known that there were rainforests in the east , but in Great Smo@@ ky Mountains National Park it can rain up to 100 inches of rain a year .
and what we &apos;re seeing is not just the potential death of the Eastern He@@ m@@ lock species -- that is to say , its extinction from nature due to this invading parasite -- but we &apos;re also seeing the death of an incredibly complex ecosystem for which these trees are merely the substrate for the aerial labyrinth of the sky that exists in their crow@@ ns .
Thank you very much .
CA : so , you have to wonder when , you know , if some other species than us was recording the stories that mattered on Earth , you know , our stories are about Iraq and war and politics and celebrity gossip .

some of these people have had tough valleys .
we just have to shift our lives a little , so we can say , &quot; I &apos;m a wea@@ ver , we &apos;re a wea@@ ver . &quot;
Ötzi is the oldest mu@@ mmy that &apos;s been discovered with preserved skin .

now , I &apos;m not wearing sunscreen in this video , but if I was , those blue spots would not appear , and then when my sunscreen wore off later , the solar freckles would reappear in UV light and I would know that it was time to re@@ apply sunscreen .
and the third is a little bit less obvious .
because some people think that the $ 100 laptop just happened a year ago , or two years ago , or we were struck by lightning -- this actually has gone back a long time , and in fact , back to the &apos; 60s .
and I said , &quot; That &apos;s kind of too bad , because we need 100 million units a year . &quot;
and my laptop runs slower , less reliably and less pleas@@ antly than it ever has before .
when you open it up , it &apos;s going to go &apos; bing . &apos; &quot; it &apos;ll be on .
and one of the reasons you can &apos;t see it is because it &apos;s back@@ lighting most of the time , most cell phones .
OK . seven countries .
they can decide -- it &apos;s the federal government in each case .
and if it comes out at 13@@ 8 dollars , so what ?
I also think that more generally , the use of the Internet and technology as a kind of a space between us for creativity and design is a general trend .
I thought that might be a fun thing to talk about for a second .
and I think that if you really sit and think about it , virtual worlds , and where we &apos;re going with more and more computing technology , represent essentially the likely , really tac@@ tically possible version of space exploration .
the first is that , as I said , the -- well , the first difference for virtual worlds is that information is presented to you in the virtual world using the most powerful iconic symbols that you can possibly use with human beings .
and so I think , again , that it &apos;s likely that in the next decade or so these virtual worlds are going to be the most common way as human beings that we kind of use the electronics of the Internet , if you will , to be together , to consume information .
and what was so amazing right from the start was that the idea that we had put out in the zoning concept , basically , was instantly and thoroughly ignored , and like , two months into the whole thing , -- which is really a small amount of time , even in Second Life time -- I remember the users , the people who were then using Second Life , the residents came to me and said , we want to buy the disc@@ o -- because I had built it -- we want to buy that land and ra@@ ze it and put houses on it . and I sold it to them -- I mean , we transferred ownership and they had a big party and blew up the entire building .
PR : exactly . and it -- but it closed on day one , basically , in Internet time .
( Laughter ) How many people here know what my avatar looks like ?
how can a plastic clip learn something about our blood ... without a blood sample ?
the Ne@@ bra disk is un@@ controversial .
it seems like the universe is just infinite , which it is , but the observable universe is finite .
and it &apos;s not just like a basketball that you smo@@ osh down into a little point and it &apos;s super dense and that &apos;s weird .
and this is how they move on the sky .
isn &apos;t that incredible ?
so here in this study , they took a group of healthy adults and they limited them to six hours of sleep a night for one week , and then they measured the change in their gene activity profile relative to when those same individuals were getting a full eight hours of sleep a night .
in fact , that &apos;s our goal : if you were having a conversation with Di@@ gi@@ Doug one-on-one , is it real enough so that you could tell whether or not I was lying to you ?
there were 55 of them .
the first thing I did was to hire four of the original 55 people .

good news : chariot &apos;s coming .
no , we learned something else .
after the -- she was glad to have a story about herself , of course , but after the concert she came up and she said , &quot; David , I &apos;ve got to tell you something .
I just wanted you boys to learn the value of hard work .
good news : chariot &apos;s coming .
two of them landed in the side door of his new C@@ it@@ ro@@ en .
we said , well , what are you going to do with it ?
I want all of my kids to understand what the bar should be for how they &apos;re treated and to have a language and a voice to use when that bar is not met versus just accepting it .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because whenever I did try to get a role that wasn &apos;t a poorly written stereotype , I would hear , &quot; We &apos;re not looking to cast this role diver@@ sely . &quot;
that conversation lets us all off the hook .
which , of course , I am not agreeing with because , although I am 94 , I am not still working .
so I d@@ ous@@ ed him in co@@ lo@@ gn@@ e every day , which he thought was very nice , and therefore he brought bread and butter every day , which I had to eat out of courtesy .
( Laughter ) After I brushed them off with a hand motion , they were very -- I finally was now accepted , and worked there for some six months .
but when that first sensor worked , it was glorious .

it only measured Heal@@ thium &apos;s impact on levels of a particular kind of cholesterol .
individual action is great , but antibiotic resistance and climate change -- they require more .
and yet , per capita meat consumption is as high as it &apos;s been in recorded history .
we also need governments .
now , that &apos;s a lot , a lot of bees , and that &apos;s really important .
and below , you can see all these out yards , or temporary yards , where the colonies are brought in until February , and then they &apos;re shipped out to the al@@ mon@@ ds .
and that &apos;s important for many fronts , and one of them is because of that culture that &apos;s in agriculture .
all these obstacles can make sustainable aquaculture feel a long way off , but innovative farmers are finding new ways to responsibly farm the seas .
my parents gave me an extraordinary name : Bar@@ at@@ un@@ de Ra@@ fi@@ q Thur@@ ston .

you &apos;re not in a hurry , doesn &apos;t matter .
you &apos;re going to be de@@ stitute .
and then I hope you &apos;ll channel it into something positive and productive .
well , most of you anyway .
but even in this concer@@ tin@@ a@@ ed cosmic perspective , our century is very , very special , the first when humans can change themselves and their home planet .
and what I want to talk to you about today is what that gift is , and I also want to explain to you why it is that it hasn &apos;t made a damn bit of difference .
because they had the sense that declining wages are worse than rising wages , even when the total amount of wages is higher in the declining period . here &apos;s another nice example .
these are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked the simplest of all questions : how much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now ?
and these are subjective values , and what you can see is , our two rules are preserved .
people always think more is better than less : 60 is always better than 50 , and they always think now is better than later : the bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side .
notice something interesting that this implies -- namely , that when people get to the future , they will change their minds .
I mean , this is a society that has learned -- and there are others too -- that has learned to live with a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it , shall I say , as those of us who have not had many terror attacks .

Kra@@ e@@ mer &apos;s book spur@@ red others to write their own books and give sermons on the dangers of witchcraft .
so , back to Mars .
so why might it be hard to find ?
and these organisms , because they &apos;re very separate from the surface , make a vast array of novel compounds .
and then , secondly , getting back to that earlier point that I made about the preci@@ ousness of any life that we may find on Mars , we don &apos;t want to contaminate it .
did life start here and was it transported there ?
and only today is science starting to figure out how it works .
as I say , if you &apos;re in a swarm , your odds of being the unlucky one are reduced as compared to a small group .
well , you don &apos;t have to be a whole creature .
now comes the very risky part of my talk , which is to demonstrate that inanimate things can synchronize .

the nutri@@ tionist said I should eat root vegetables Sa@@ id if I could get down 13 tur@@ ni@@ ps a day I would be grounded , rooted .
and so when I met with three children from the schools , who had traveled all day to come to Bogot@@ a , one of the three children brought her mother .
he caused a war that killed 20 million people -- still the deadliest civil war in the world to this day .
it &apos;s part of the phenomenon I called &quot; spontaneous self-organization , &quot; where , like in ant colonies , little decisions made on the micro level actually have a big impact on the macro level .
( Applause ) For an entrepreneurial advice circle of just strangers , where the hosts don &apos;t want everybody to just listen to the one venture capitalist in the room -- ( Laughter ) knowing laugh -- ( Laughter ) you can &apos;t reveal what you do for a living .
I had gotten the first job I applied for in academia , land of a thousand crushed dreams .
and then I called my husband , and he rushed to find me and I said all the true things that I have known .
I interviewed countless meg@@ ach@@ urch pastors with spectacular hair about how they live their best lives now .
but despite telling myself , &quot; I &apos;m just studying this stuff , I &apos;m nothing like them , &quot; when I got my diagnosis , I suddenly understood how deeply invested I was in my own Hor@@ ati@@ o Al@@ ger theology .
so I began to ask friends , theologians , historians , nuns I liked , &quot; What I am I going to do when that loving feeling is gone ? &quot;
and every now and then , it will feel like more than enough .
inspired by LEGO , we &apos;ve built a social housing project in Copenhagen , where we stacked blocks of wood next to each other .
and by gently wiggling the blocks , we can actually create curves or any organic form , adapting to any urban context .
or a like a weed growing through the cracks in the pavement and blossom@@ ing as it gets light and air .
so right in front of it , we &apos;re building our smallest project .
and we got inspired by the High Line .
so we sat down with the citizens living along the waterfront of New York , and we worked with them to try to design the necessary flood protection in such a way that it only makes their waterfront more accessible and more enjoyable .
last scene of all , That ends this strange ev@@ ent@@ ful history , Is second chil@@ dish@@ ness and mere oblivion ; S@@ ans teeth , sans eyes , sans taste , sans everything .
but the general idea that you could only -- you could only really talk about things in that place that had some kind of experimental basis .
( Laughter ) KM : I mean , I didn &apos;t really think of that as an argument so much as just a lively discussion .
( Laughter ) You know , that &apos;s what you call a lead .
you know , I started off with little tiny amounts of potassium nit@@ rate and sugar , which was readily available , and I mixed it in different proportions , and I tried to light it on fire .
and then it melted into a little sort of sy@@ rup@@ y liquid , brown .
but that ... process is what I think of as science , see , where you start with some idea , and then instead of , like , looking up , every authority that you &apos;ve ever heard of I -- sometimes you do that , if you &apos;re going to write a paper later , you want to figure out who else has worked on it .
and everybody stepped back a little and said , you know , we ought to invest in this shit , because whoever has got the most of these people working in the places is going to have a dominant position , at least in the military , and probably in all kind of economic ways .
and most responsible people that measure temperatures realize you have to shield your measuring device from that .
remember the 10 things that are going to get you . the -- one of them -- ( Laughter ) And the asteroids is the one I really agree with there .

we want to share with you an audacious idea from The Nature Conserv@@ ancy .
and this is how the work gets done .
and my mother was a kind of a designer , also .
and the problem when you &apos;re younger -- for all you students out there -- is , your head gets kind of big really easy .
remember that moment ? it felt so good , didn &apos;t it ?
this is in the &apos; 80s , in the great clash of computer / non-@@ computer people .
I started studying this whole idea , of like , what is this computer ? it &apos;s a strange medium .
and also , one thing I realized is that I like to make things .
it &apos;s real simul@@ tane@@ ity . it &apos;s nothing we &apos;re used to working with .
I did a show in London last year made out of iPods -- I used iPods as a material .
I discovered that I had to find the equation of art and design , which we know as cir@@ cle@@ -@@ triang@@ le-@@ square .
and I say , well , I &apos;m going to bring the future back to RISD .
really interesting questions . I think a lot of it has to do with body size .
2@@ 28 million years old , we found what really is the most primitive dinosaur : that &apos;s the Ur@@ -@@ dinosaur .
PS : don &apos;t get off . you don &apos;t get off , but don &apos;t worry about me .
now , I tried to su@@ ture together a dinosaur evolutionary history so that we can try to understand some basic patterns of evolution .
and ultimately we can control the branching to mimic what we think the continents were like , and run it a thousand times , so we can estimate the parameters , to answer the question whether we are on the mark or not , at least to know the barriers of the problems . so that &apos;s a little bit about the science .
I worked up a portfolio , and I was headed to New York .

a very unique engine -- it &apos;s round , it &apos;s small , it &apos;s vibra@@ tion-@@ free .
( Laughter ) Develop@@ ing the Skycar has been a real challenge .
that was the bar .
what if those who hire bio@@ engineers and become them give 20 percent of their time to building defenses for the common good ?
so I decided one day to cross over from the superficial fashion world to the superficial art world .
( Laughs ) As the quote goes , &quot; Everyone else is already taken . &quot;
often , the good ideas are so star@@ ing-@@ at-@@ you-@@ right-@@ in-the-@@ face that you kind of miss them . and I think , a lot of times , what we do is just , sort of , hold the mirror up to our clients , and sort of go , &quot; Du@@ h ! you know , look what &apos;s really going on . &quot;

they &apos;ll ask the nurses to input data .
you can draw from this .
last section : green ar@@ mb@@ and . we &apos;ve all got them .
so as a final gesture we handed out these brac@@ elets to all of you this morning .
so , in all of these examples , structure is the determining force .
so , even a straight line , defined with calculus , is a curve .
because we &apos;re using escal@@ ators to move people , all of these trus@@ ses are picking up diagonal loads .
so , every one of them is a little bit differ@@ ent-@@ shaped as you move down the length of the building .
so , not to pick on BMW , or to celebrate them , but take BMW as an example .
and I don &apos;t know if there &apos;s a stronger kind of effect than pattern and the way it unites kind of disparate elements .
as spectacular as the mo@@ ai are for visitors today , you have to imagine being there then , with colossal mo@@ ai marching around the island .
you know , so much of the discussion surrounding our future focuses on technology , efficiency and speed .

it &apos;s mainly starch , and starch , when you break it down -- what is starch ? it &apos;s -- thank you -- sugar , yes .
the final fermentation takes place in stage nine .

as you get older , the ris@@ ers get sh@@ allo@@ wer and the steps get wider , and you start moving along at a slower pace because you &apos;re making fewer discoveries .
I don &apos;t know how many of you have seen it , but it &apos;s a beau@@ t .
and then I found that actors and actresses actually take their cues from the floor , so it turned out that these sorts of sign systems began to make sense .
Bloomberg was all about numbers , and we did big numbers through the space and the numbers were projected on a spectacular LED that my partner , Lisa Stra@@ us@@ feld , programmed .
why don &apos;t you celebrate them , and make the under@@ passes landmarks ? &quot;
and I had recently discovered a bomb shelter in the backyard of a house I had bought in LA that the real estate person hadn &apos;t pointed out .
it wasn &apos;t some , you know , weird gr@@ un@@ ge type or something ; it looked like they might be real . anyway .
you know : Thank God it &apos;s Monday -- I get to go back to that little cubicle , those fake gray walls , and hear everybody else &apos;s conversations f or 10 hours and then go home .
and this is how the ad ran around the world .
in Germany , they made one small change without checking with me -- nor did they have to , because it was done through agencies -- but see if you can tell the difference .
and I was fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some books .
it just seems to me possibly even a blank page would have been more appropriate .
what just happened ?
if any of these women , who were mostly from poor backgrounds , fall through the cracks in the already broken system , the bottom of that chasm is a prison , period .
what we do is we build bridges for them .
a genome is really a description for all of the DNA that is in a living organism .
DNA is a very elegant molecule .
they &apos;re here . they &apos;re in the universe .
and my answer is that it &apos;s not too late .
now where does one go if you want to get the support of humanity ?
there &apos;s only one place : the United Nations .
an imaging system collects these photons and processes them to reveal the answer : 3 and 5 .
( Laughter ) The majority of models , tools and ideas on Worldchanging en@@ compass combinations of these characteristics , so I want to give you a few concrete examples of how these principles combine in world-changing ways .
in Kenya , mobile phone minutes have actually become an alternative currency .
now , many of the people who participate in Earth Witness would focus on ecological problems , human-@@ caused or otherwise , especially environmental crimes and significant sources of greenhouse gases and emissions .
and most important , you can &apos;t ignore how important mobile phones are to global youth .
and as we work to figure out ways to mitigate the worst effects of climate disruption , every little bit of information matters .
and as we say at Worldchanging , another world isn &apos;t just possible ; another world is here .
it might just be a simple hormone or something that could do this .
right after , I got an invitation to go to a science fiction convention , and with all great ear@@ ne@@ stness walked in .
well , we know from astro@@ biology that we can really now predict what &apos;s going to happen to our particular planet .
a 10-@@ kilometer body hit the planet .
because it looks like those terrible geo@@ desi@@ c domes of my late beloved &apos; 60s , they &apos;re called &quot; buck@@ y@@ balls . &quot;
but there &apos;s lots of stuff .
and there &apos;s two things that are really evident here to me , is that these extinctions take place when CO2 is going up .
and we think this is the reason that complexity took so long to take place on planet Earth .
( Applause ) But above all else , my focus was on surviving .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong -- I am incredibly grateful to be alive , and I am painfully aware that this struggle is a privilege that many don &apos;t get to experience .
I &apos;ve heard what I consider an extraordinary thing that I &apos;ve only heard a little bit in the two previous TED@@ s , and what that is is an inter@@ weaving and an inter@@ lar@@ ding , an inter@@ mixing , of a sense of social responsibility in so many of the talks -- global responsibility , in fact , appealing to enlightened self-interest , but it goes far beyond enlightened self-interest .
well , you know precisely what it is .
I have been really lucky with this technology : all of a sudden as it is ready , the world is ready to accept it .
that &apos;s my invention . I sold that for seven million dollars .
I actually drew that up on a little cru@@ mmy Mac computer in my attic at my house , and one of the many designs which they have now is still the same design I drew way back when .

it matters to me that young men and women right across the country can imagine for themselves that they , too , can be and are part of the story of our nation .
I look for signs of one specific trait .

some may disagree , but I believe the Bronx was designed to fail .
it &apos;s because information about things on orbit is not commonly shared either .
well , in that case , that &apos;s what your space traffic map would look like .

the good news is , you don &apos;t actually have to be a doctor to provide that special sauce of care and continuity .
and even with all of my background and training in the field , I was taken ab@@ ack by how little attention was paid to delivering high-quality maternal health care .
when I say 60 percent are preventable , I mean there are concrete steps and standard procedures that we could implement that could prevent these bad outcomes from occurring and save women &apos;s lives .
there are some places that have actually adopted these standards , and it &apos;s really making a difference .
for a hemorrhage , you need a cart that has everything a doctor or nurse might need in an emergency : an IV line , an oxygen mask , medications , check@@ lists , other equipment .
in the meantime , we can tackle quality of care .
for me , the answer is that seriousness is not the correct response to the absurdity of life .
absolutely super . &quot;
for me , I think , it &apos;s laughter .
and for this festival , about 100 million people congregate .
so , it was going nowhere .
his father didn &apos;t want him to be a poet , so at sixteen he began to write under the pen name &quot; Pablo Neruda . &quot; the poems in his early collection &quot; Tw@@ enty Love Po@@ ems and a Song of Des@@ pair &quot; were tender and percep@@ tive , illuminating the subtle@@ ties of love and en@@ chan@@ t@@ ment .
its half-@@ sh@@ elled body illustrates an important point about the modern turtle : it actually has two shells that develop totally separately while the turtle is still an embryo .
when people with lots of resources and good forecasts don &apos;t prepare for deadly hurricanes , they &apos;re often failing to imagine how dangerous they can be .
OK , one more tool of foresight .
and I had some fabulous ones .
so maybe if Nicholas S@@ parks &apos;s team works a little harder , he could easily be number one , because it &apos;s almost by accident who ended up at the top .
and that led from one high-@@ impact paper to the other one .
and you think , OK , well , science is special , but what about other areas where we need to be creative ?
good job ! yeah !
and you can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want .
video : ( music ) DM : and now I &apos;ll attach the filter to the drums , so I can control the effect live .
and &quot; fu &quot; means &quot; pillar . &quot;
these were flags that were sent by families whom she helped treat their infer@@ tility problems .
&#91; anyone who refuses to steri@@ lize will be arrested . &#93; and so were the threats against disobe@@ ying it .
the message see@@ ped into our minds so much so that I grew up feeling embarrassed for having a younger brother .
while Kafka often seems suspended in strangeness , there &apos;s a tenderness and integrity at the heart of his mission that keeps him moving forward .
when they were kids in Poland , their father , fearing for his son &apos;s safety , gave them a little bit of money and told them to walk west , to just keep walking west across Europe .
but there are ways that we can have policies that reflect our values and actually make sense , given the reality in the world .
and even more traditional typefaces , say like a Gar@@ amond , holds vesti@@ ges of this old system in which you can see the A where it get little bit thinner at the top and thicker down below , because it &apos;s trying to look like someone had made it by hand .
but Futura , in contrast , is designed to look like no one had touched it at all , that this was made by a machine , for a machine age , for an industrial age .
again , it was a really powerful experience .
&quot; overlooked &quot; is including other marginalized people as well .
about the only thing people can agree on is that the most strategic time for a child to start learning is early .
at-risk children who reach school without basic skills are 25 percent more likely to drop out , 40 percent more likely to become teen parents and 60 percent less likely to go to college .
our audacious idea is to take UPSTART across the country -- not to replace anything ; we want to serve children who otherwise would not have access to early education .
the other kids gave me a bunch of extra attention , because I had been on &quot; Family T@@ ies . &quot;
anytime somebody posts on Instagram , they get a certain amount of attention from their followers , whether they have a few followers or a few million followers .
so thank you , that &apos;s it , you can give your attention to someone else now .
GH : OK , one . JL : OK .
now , how about incentives ?
the truth is that there are no incentives that you can devise that are ever going to be smart enough .
it causes people who engage in that activity to lose mor@@ ale and it causes the activity itself to lose morality .
what to do instead ?
one is that we are always teaching .
that &apos;s the principle objective .
like , &quot; You &apos;re amazing ! I love you ! &quot;
and I was looking for caves : caves because caves are the original prime real estate .
but we were also getting information that this incredibly delicate environment and its people were under threat because they were at the frontline of both Middle Eastern politics and climate change .
and unless you want this person to not just become the CF@@ O of Florida , but the United States , we &apos;d better deal with this stuff .
so , Rosie runs around on sk@@ ates and the other one ran on flat threads .
in fact , some are doing it just right now .
we go down quite a distance and the missions typically last eight to nine hours in a confined space .
a public education system should not create a wider bottom and more narrow top .
that encourages them to embrace new dreams , new goals , and progress in the various opportunities that music has to offer .
from the minute a child &apos;s taught how to play an instrument , he &apos;s no longer poor .
in study two , it &apos;s the two remot@@ es , one with the positive and one with the negative value .
psychologists study behavior to explore the contents of the mind , because our behavior often reflects our beliefs , our values and our desires .
and in turn , this ends up shaping their own behavior .
first used by colon@@ izers to dehuman@@ ize indigenous people , it has since been applied to anyone who eats human flesh .
but we do know that people have been eating each other , volunteering themselves to be eaten , and accusing others of eating people for millennia .
and each new host increases the potential for a full-blown epidemic .
these nomadic groups often fought each other .
in China , Ku@@ bla@@ i Khan &apos;s Yu@@ an Dynasty is remembered as a golden age of science and culture .
we &apos;ve gone from the four television channels of my childhood to the seeming infinity of cable and streaming .
they , too , must have circled fires , speaking softly of their dreams , their hopes , their futures .
it &apos;s a form of incurable leukemia that affli@@ cts approximately 20,000 adults every year in the United States .
over inter@@ dimensional radio , your engineers explain that the robot can telep@@ ort into the alternate universes you &apos;re trapped in , but it &apos;ll do so completely at random .
you volunteer to be the person in charge of pressing the button when the moment is right , and give the following directions to everyone else .
as a trained radio operator who knew Paris well and spoke fluent French , Noor was an attractive recruit .
it usually works either by directing police atten@@ tions and police resources , or changing police behavior once they show up .
politics governs every aspect of life , and by not participating in it , you &apos;re literally allowing other people to decide on what you can eat , wear , if you can have access to health care , free education , how much tax you pay , when you can retire , what is your pension .
to summarize , our glaciers are melting rapidly , and global warming is making them melt much more quickly .
one obvious scenario is the potential de@@ stabili@@ zation caused by tens of millions of climate refugees , who &apos;ll be forced to move because they have no or little water , or because their livelihoods have been destroyed by the melting of glaciers .
we must think globally and act regi@@ onally .
( Laughter ) Ca@@ used by the powerful and nefarious forces of people who say there &apos;s no such thing as society , who tell us that our highest purpose in life is to fight like stray dogs over a du@@ st@@ bin .
but in the world we live in today , with growing divides and inequalities , with disa@@ ff@@ ection and alienation , it is more important than ever that we ask and find the answers to those questions and promote a vision of society that has well-being , not just wealth , at its very heart .
now , holding more capital looks and is inefficient .
the countries that are most advanced have been working for years now , changing their water and food supply and healthcare systems , because they recognize that by the time they have certain prediction , that information may very well come too late .
the more we let machines think for us , the less we can think for ourselves .
the harder , deeper truth is that the future is uncharted , that we can &apos;t map it till we get there .
longer than a &quot; M@@ ad Max &quot; movie .
as you recall , many people had filed out before even the first point was concluded .
it has taught me about violence and pain and hope and resilience and struggle and sacrifice .

I hit almost all the border towns -- Brow@@ n@@ s@@ ville , Rey@@ nos@@ a , Mc@@ Allen , Yu@@ ma , Cal@@ ex@@ ico -- recording the increasing milit@@ ar@@ ization of the border .
the question of how they continue to grow is the first mystery of dust bun@@ nies .
of the three constraints offered , the one that narrows our options the most is if the number is a perfect cube .
corporate es@@ pi@@ onage is not an easy game - but sometimes , that &apos;s just how the sausage is made .
Cast@@ or and Pol@@ lux , the twin trick@@ sters hatched from an egg .
sometimes , depending on the setting , &quot; Whoa , that &apos;s a conversation killer . &quot;
for example , Sarah , age 10 .
in Uganda , four years ago , an eight-year-old girl could be married to a 30-@@ year-old man .
and in Uganda , a safe schools toolkit has been rolled out now to half of teachers in Uganda , equi@@ pping them to control a class with nonviolent discipline .
for example , regions such as the Gulf Atlantic might be cooled in the months before a hurricane season to reduce the force of storms .
so , if there &apos;s even a chance that this could be close to reality , is this something we should consider seriously ?
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s Dr. Cheryl Ol@@ man , who works at the University of Minnesota &apos;s Center for Mag@@ netic Res@@ on@@ ance Research .

( Applause ) I have a disease called vi@@ ti@@ li@@ go .
when I &apos;m at work and I &apos;m wearing the makeup or wearing the makeup outside , I &apos;m the TV guy .
it was tough , and those were some tough years .
like this one time , I &apos;m at the store and this dude is like staring at me , like burning a hole in the side of my head .
this little girl , she wasn &apos;t trying to be mean .
but I jumped back on my plan and just put on my blin@@ ders , started going back out .
so I wanted to know who was making this stuff .
he knew the underlying facts , but he also knew that facts do not drive conversation online .
and she found this stuff really off-@@ putting but also kind of en@@ gros@@ sing , kind of like she couldn &apos;t look away from it .
but this is TED , so let &apos;s get practical .
you know , I looked through the entire list of TED speakers this year .
over time , most of the planet &apos;s organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there , mostly by microbes .
since then , I &apos;ve had the great pleasure of working with the Googl@@ ers , with D@@ OE@@ R Marine , with National Geographic , with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world , ones that we could enlist , to put the ocean in Google Earth .
just ten years ago I stood on the ice at the North Pole .
whatever it is , a fraction of one percent is not enough .
we understand the scientific basis for the inter@@ rel@@ at@@ edness of life but our ego hasn &apos;t caught up yet .
occasionally , throughout history , this concept of this very large cosmic perspective comes to the surface , and as a result we see transformative and profound discoveries .
the 21st century now allows us to build bigger glasses -- much bigger glasses .
so , if that &apos;s right , why did we only capture four out of those 15@@ 1 minds ?
and it worked . and it gave the studio great relief .
and of course , the first step is : admit you &apos;ve got a problem . ( Laughter ) So we had a big problem : we didn &apos;t know how we were going to do this .
and then here &apos;s the reconstructed performance now with the ti@@ mings of the performance .
it was a long process .
so let &apos;s go out further , till we &apos;re outside the galaxy , and look back , and yeah , there &apos;s the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us .
what does a &quot; typical &quot; place in the universe look like ?
well , at enormous expense , TED has arranged a high-resolution immersion virtual reality rendering of the view from intergalactic space .
well , not quite , not quite perfect .
now , that cube is very empty by human standards , but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter .
in regard to global warming , I &apos;m just a lay@@ man .
on one of them , carve : &quot; problems are soluble . &quot;
you know , we had to be taught to ren@@ ounce the powerful conservation ethic we developed during the Great Depression and World War II .
Narrator ( Video ) : the levels are increasing , the amount of packaging is increasing , the &quot; throwaway &quot; concept of living is prolifer@@ ating , and it &apos;s showing up in the ocean .
I made a really stupid kind of mistake that most 19-year-old males do when they think they &apos;re immortal , and I got a bad case of the bends and was paralyzed , and had to be flown back for treatment .
and of course , the third problem is the one I found out the hard way in Pal@@ au , which is the bends .
no ; it only takes a couple minutes to get down to three or four hundred feet , which is what we &apos;re aiming for .
( Laughter ) So we &apos;re down there -- this is at 400 feet .
that &apos;s why we weren &apos;t worried much and were joking around .
what &apos;s extraordinary is not just the number of species we &apos;re finding -- though as you can see , that &apos;s pretty amazing ; this is only half of what we &apos;ve found -- what &apos;s extraordinary is how quickly we find them .
so I wanted to create a fictional character or an animal that d@@ wells in these underground spaces , and the simplest way to do it , at the time , was to model myself .
it got abandoned when the new Cro@@ ton A@@ que@@ ducts opened in 1890 .
it &apos;s very dangerous to get lost in there .
and this trend of people using this communication network to help each other out goes far beyond the original idea of just keeping up with family and friends .
why is that ?
one kind of re@@ viewer is a male gamer who thinks he knows what games ought to be , and won &apos;t show the product to little girls .
they haven &apos;t looked at children and they &apos;re certainly not demonstrating any love for them .
we didn &apos;t want to lose the people that are going to work in that plantation .
we plant in the seedlings mixed with the bananas , the pap@@ ay@@ as , all the crops for the local people , but the trees are growing up fast in between as well .
now we looked at the clouds above this forest ; we looked at the re@@ forestation area , the semi-@@ open area and the open area .
( Laughter ) &quot; Shir@@ tless Medical Student , &quot; &quot; Shir@@ tless S@@ ter@@ o@@ id-@@ U@@ sing C@@ on Man &quot; and , in my most well-known role , as Ra@@ fa@@ el .

but I don &apos;t have a desire to fit into the current broken definition of masculinity , because I don &apos;t just want to be a good man .
and now three generations later , I find myself playing that role , too .

they ended up making a CD which they took home to their family and friends , thereby expressing their own experiences with nature in their own medium .
what can I , as an ecologist , do about that ?
given the du@@ re@@ ss that we &apos;re feeling environmentally in these times , it is time for scientists to reach outward , and time for those outside of science to reach towards academia as well .
great .
so the next day I go out .
it &apos;s qui@@ vering , and it lies down and it &apos;s in obvious distress .
that &apos;s weird . &quot;
( Laughter ) But I would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time .
( Laughter ) And I sort of really was dumb@@ struck .
can we get complex 3D structure automatically assembling in inorganic systems ?
each different color has a different magnetic polarity , and the sequence is uniquely speci@@ fying the structure that is coming out .
and literally with only those two inputs -- so , the shape of your boundary condition and the pressure -- you can define an infinite number of lenses that cover the range of human refrac@@ tive error , from minus 12 to plus eight di@@ op@@ ters , up to four di@@ op@@ ters of cylinder .
and as you play ping-pong , whenever the ball hits part of the table , the ripples spread out and the fish run away .
and the third level is reflective , which is , if you like the super@@ ego , it &apos;s a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do , no control over the -- doesn &apos;t see the senses , doesn &apos;t control the muscles .
and so my research group at the Media Lab has been developing a series of inventions to give us access to this information in a sort of easy way , without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior .
I &apos;m actually wearing the device right now and we &apos;ve sort of co@@ bbled it together with components that are off the shelf -- and that , by the way , only cost 350 dollars at this point in time .
and so , Pran@@ a@@ v turns the page of the book and can then see additional information about the book -- reader comments , maybe sort of information by his favorite critic , etc .
( Laughter ) But also , I &apos;m just not sure that watching a bunch of half-@@ naked people run around and burn things is really the inspiration they need right now .
because it reads as a workplace .
but because of this history of decay and renewal and segregation and integration , cities are the source of some of our best ideas about how to build functional , thriving communities .
Holly Wh@@ y@@ te observed that in healthy public spaces , there are often many different places that afford different ways of relating .
remember the park that we talked about that built social trust ?
that didn &apos;t happen because people were having these big political arguments .
we need digital urban planners , new Jane Jac@@ ob@@ ses , who are going to build the parks and park benches of the online world .
and the local doctors , the Cambodi@@ ans , had never heard of these drugs , so they were like , what are they ?
in the international measurements of loneliness , Britain and the rest of Europe are just behind the US , in case anyone here is feeling smug .
we &apos;ve been trained to look for happiness in all the wrong places , and just like junk food doesn &apos;t meet your nutritional needs and actually makes you feel terrible , junk values don &apos;t meet your psychological needs , and they take you away from a good life .
and part of the point of the group was to get people to think about a moment in their life they had actually found meaning and purpose .
I work in India , which has made incredible progress in bringing elementary education for all .
and that is , because of our entire approach , with data and with technology , that five percent of villages in India have 40 percent of the out-of-@@ school girls .
and as Saleem sees it , 10@@ 01 is &quot; the number of night , of magic , of alternative realities . &quot; over the course of the novel , Rush@@ die da@@ zz@@ les us with multiple versions of reality .
and they were talking for hours about all the topics where they had different opinions .
they answered all of the seven questions we asked differently .
the X axis marks distance from Earth , and the Y axis tracks the passage of time .
and a sand@@ box for new ideas about evolution . &quot;
and this image is , for humans , the beginning point of play .
if we &apos;ve got them wired up with an electro@@ ence@@ ph@@ alo@@ gram , the right brain of each of them becomes attuned , so that the joyful emergence of this earliest of play scenes and the physiology of that is something we &apos;re beginning to get a handle on .
they got together -- JPL hired them .
we all have an internal narrative that &apos;s our own inner story .
and we are , by physical anthropologists , by many , many studies , the most ne@@ ot@@ en@@ ous , the most youthful , the most flexible , the most plastic of all creatures .
so what will follow is a stud@@ ent-@@ made film about just that .
Narrator : flow is the mental state of appar@@ ition in which the person is fully immersed in what he or she is doing .
and its hugely important in learning and crafting the brain .
well , let &apos;s round these kids up , put them in pens and make them play for months at a time ; they &apos;ll all be geniuses and go to Harvard . &quot;
so we &apos;re talking about making the place , making the world run better by making this data available .
that &apos;s how linked data works .
maybe tell them about that . &quot;
but the design of the study didn &apos;t allow for definitive causal conclusions .
most people would agree that we have a serious problem with misogyny , sexual violence and rape in this country , and pornography probably isn &apos;t helping with any of that .
less than 50 percent of the states in the United States require that sex education be taught in schools , including how to prevent co@@ er@@ ced sex .
so this is where I find myself as a violence prevention activist .
it was my very first climate strike ever and an incredibly strange setting , just me and her sitting there at this conference hall , surrounded by this bus@@ yness of the suit@@ -@@ wearing conference crowd who had no idea what to do with us .
I was now certain that no one else was going to fix this for us , and if there was just the slightest chance that this could make a difference , it seemed almost foolish not to give it a go .
and we also see it &apos;s still possible to hold other disastrous developments we &apos;re seeing , such as mass extinction and soil degradation -- yes , technically .
but we are not the limit ; we are the start .
bad news first : if you thought I would tell you now to cycle more or eat less meat , to fly less , or to go secondhand shopping , sorry , this is not that easy .
and if you have a bank account , tell your bank you &apos;re going to leave if they keep investing in fossil fuels .
so anyone who &apos;s got a solution to dealing with this problem has a valuable asset .
and that doesn &apos;t seem like very long .
and that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;re doing at T@@ horn .
over six million years , we and the chimps evolved our different ways .
and there are lots of super@@ normal stimuli ; chocolate cake is one .
but unfortunately , thousands upon thousands of people would believe it was her .
for weeks , she could hardly eat or speak .
deepfakes appear authentic and realistic , but they &apos;re not ; they &apos;re total false@@ hoods .
and what if the very next day there &apos;s another deepfake that drops , that shows a well-known imam based in London praising the attack on those soldiers ?
we &apos;ve seen false@@ hoods spread on WhatsApp and other online message services lead to violence against ethnic minorities .
the deepfake could tank the IP@@ O , and worse , shake our sense that financial markets are stable .
we could choose to enact economic policies that raise taxes on the rich , regulate powerful corporations or raise wages for workers .
well , it &apos;s super clear to me what we need to do .
so the neoliberal idea that inclusion is this fancy luxury to be afforded if and when we have growth is both wrong and backwards .
I didn &apos;t start designing 10 years ago with the mission to change the entire industry .
and this is an important piece of the puzzle that many young designers may not think about when they &apos;re first starting their careers , but hiring a pl@@ us-@@ size or a transgender photographer , or a woman of color as your casting director , or a black makeup artist -- hey , Fa@@ tima Thomas -- who intimately understands how important it is to be able to work with all skin tones : it &apos;s essential to creating a holi@@ stically inclusive output , like this one .
as a fashion designers that do a lot of swim , we wanted to rewrite the rules around having a bi@@ kini body .
( Laughter ) Fear .
instead , what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit .
we got a lot of people cheating by stealing by a little bit .
no bill ever disappeared .
more generally , I want to tell you something about behavioral economics .
I want us to leave this world better than we found it .
and for some odd reason , I had on business casual .
and I knew that if I spoke up about this publicly , I could face financial loss .
and it started a conversation about discriminatory pay practices that this conference was participating in .
it &apos;s exactly how I made my living for 15 years .
so what I did was , again , like I did with the dodo skull , I blew all my reference up to full size , and then I began cutting out the negatives and using those templates as shape references .
here , I &apos;m going to put it out there , later on tonight , and I want you to pick it up and handle it .
for example , the number of people who report having at least two close friends is at an all-time low .
you may have heard of &quot; Fort@@ n@@ ite , &quot; which is a break@@ out example of the battle roy@@ ale genre , which has been played by more than 250 million people around the world .
2.3 billion people in the world play video games .
because my eyesight isn &apos;t that good but I see a lot of e@@ mot@@ es .
there is a heart disorder first recognized about two decades ago called &quot; ta@@ kot@@ sub@@ o cardi@@ omy@@ opathy , &quot; or &quot; the broken heart syndrome , &quot; in which the heart acutely weakens in response to intense stress or grief , such as after a romantic breakup or the death of a loved one .
control patients , on the other hand , had five percent more coronary plaque at one year and 28 percent more at five years .
they also had nearly double the rate of cardiac events , like heart attacks , coronary bypass surgery and cardi@@ ac@@ -related deaths .
diet and exercise alone were not enough to facilitate coronary disease regre@@ ssion .
( Laughter ) You know , he and his peers in Silicon Valley are the kings and the em@@ per@@ ors of our time .
in 2018 , Musa K@@ art was sentenced to three years in jail .
cartoonists from Venezuela , Russia , Syria have been forced into exile .
then something happened .
just let it go .
except carbon dioxide is blown over some of the plots .
it will take time to sort all of these issues out .
this is emb@@ le@@ matic of it -- this is wing dining , recalling those bal@@ my summer days somewhere over France in the 20s , dining on the wing of a plane . you can &apos;t see it very well here , but that &apos;s He@@ ming@@ way reading some pages from his new novel to Fit@@ z@@ ger@@ ald and Ford Ma@@ do@@ x Ford until the slip@@ stream blows him away .
and we also must stop romantici@@ zing solutions that distract us from the core challenges .
we also just brought online Africa &apos;s largest wind farm and East Africa &apos;s biggest solar facility .
now I &apos;m going to talk about -- I &apos;m going to build up the Seattle Central Library in this way before your eyes in about five or six diagrams , and I truly mean this is the design process that you &apos;ll see .
there are plenty of shopping malls that allow you to get out of the rain in downtown Seattle , but there are not so many free places that allow you to get out of the rain .
and the very fact that they worked in a provi@@ sional space meant that for Beckett , they could blow out a wall ; they could do &quot; Cher@@ ry Or@@ ch@@ ard &quot; and blow a hole through the floor , and so forth .
so it was a very daunting task for us to do a brand-new building that could be a pristine building , but keep this kind of experimental nature .
the moment the cores get to mid level , we finish the art museum ; we put all the mechanical equipment in it ; and then we jack it up into the air .
( Applause )
( Laughter ) They &apos;re all inventions that were created with the benefit of language .
basically , language is the most important thing in the entire world .
and when I say this sentence , &quot; Yesterday I saw K@@ yn , &quot; do you think it &apos;s really the case that everything in my mind is now implanted in your mind via this sentence ?
and it &apos;s &quot; Man@@ ic Monday &quot; again .
you should spend the time on something real . &quot;
it might make you wonder : what do we do with dead languages ?
now ...
why would anyone in their right mind invest in a society where , at least on the surface , it seems a terrible place to do business ?
you know , in poor countries , we complain a lot about corrupt politicians who embe@@ zz@@ le state funds .
what I &apos;m suggesting , though , is that corruption , especially for most people in poor countries , is a work-@@ around .
and although there were forecasts that predicted severe shortages of water in Chen@@ nai , none of them could actually help us pinpoint exactly when or where this was going to happen .
and if you &apos;re not looking to make this type of investment but you own land in the US , did you know that you can leverage your land to conserve water quality permanently with a conservation eas@@ ement ?
accountability is not corporate pollu@@ ters spon@@ soring environmental groups and museums .
I ran to the library to figure out what an herb@@ arium was .
the thing is , farmers are scaled already in Africa .
so the question is : what happened ?
and then the project got picked up online , which was horrifying and humbling .
100 years ago , this was done by everybody that had a garden or a small stand of trees in their backyard , and grew varieties that were passed down through their family .
so Govern@@ ors Island is a former naval base that was given to the City of New York in 2000 .
I &apos;m not sure why there is a hole in this particular man .
we let Uncle Bernie and his fellow genealo@@ gists document their family trees through a genealogy website called geni@@ .com .
we can leverage this data to learn quantitative information about humanity , for example , questions about demo@@ graphy .
they &apos;re certainly trying .
so what about governments ?
because we actually know very little about the long-term consequences of hate and dis@@ information on people &apos;s attitudes and behaviors .
no one sector , let alone nonprofit , start-up or government , is going to solve this .
these scientists have started thinking about experimental tests to find out whether our universe is a simulation .
so a simulation would have to represent space and time in very small pieces .
Lou@@ hi was so delighted with the object &apos;s limitless productive power that she ran off to lock her treasure inside a mountain .

how does a shirt that I know thousands of people wear , a shirt like this one , how does it somehow feel like it &apos;s mine ?
and that &apos;s what I mean by productive conflict : pushing up against the things that aren &apos;t working for us when there exists no other path forward .
( Laughter ) So this is a confession of my love for parrotfish in all their flam@@ boy@@ ant , alga@@ e-@@ eating , s@@ and-@@ po@@ oping , sex-@@ changing glory .
because really , it &apos;s a condition about choice , and the lack of freedom .
and in the middle of this economic crisis , where so many of us are inclined to pull in with fear , I think we &apos;re well suited to take a cue from Jane and reach out , recognizing that being poor doesn &apos;t mean being ordinary .
we &apos;re so lucky to have you here with us .
and so this is something we should be continuing to work on .
so we shouldn &apos;t be trying to de@@ tain children for any more than 21 days , and we should be getting children , if they &apos;re in our custody , we should be taking care of them human@@ ely , and making sure they &apos;re with people that can provide them a safe and loving environment .
and so this is something that we should be able to design .
am : so I have two more questions for you before I &apos;m going to let you go back to work .
it is also critical that local conservationists be part of every conservation effort , if we are to build trust and really embed conservation into communities .
like what happened to my husband .
a bias called the bias blind spot .
I wouldn &apos;t know .
and my brain will also act on all this sensory information .
casting himself as the protagonist , Dante travels deeper and deeper into Hell &apos;s abyss , witnessing ob@@ scene punishments distinct to each of its nine realms .
dishon@@ ored and with little hope of return , the author freely aired his griev@@ ances with the Church and Italian society .
it was the iPhone . the iPhone came out that day .
the answer is , &quot; All the time ! &quot;
excuse me one second .
your home phone , your work phone , your cell phone , your yach@@ t phone ( this is the E@@ G crowd ) .
( Laughter ) The beauty of that is you never miss a call .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing -- and they text you back the answer .
but it &apos;s a human being on the line . and it &apos;s gotten me out of so many tough positions like , &quot; When &apos;s the last flight out of Chicago ? &quot;
you know . it &apos;s just absolutely amazing .
I &apos;m not kidding you . the message said , &quot; Was walking along the street &quot; and &quot; sky was blue &quot; and &quot; emergency &quot; !
( Laughter ) And lastly , I just have to talk about this one .
I &apos;ve heard there &apos;s something new -- a million times more ra@@ d than my phone .
I want to touch its precious screen .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you very much .
but why can &apos;t they ?
af : OK , so we need them to simply raise the value of the building blocks of plastic from oil and gas , which I call &quot; bad plastic , &quot; raise the value of that , so that when it spreads through the brands and onto us , the customers , we won &apos;t barely even notice an increase in our coffee cup or Coke or Pepsi , or anything .
af : no , I am going to cheer for this boom .
Thank you for sharing this with us .
in October 18@@ 20 , his reign finally reached its tragic conclusion .
I wanted to come up with something I hoped could make me a better teacher , and give the youngsters under my supervision , be it in athle@@ tics or the English classroom , something to which to aspire , other than just a higher mark in the classroom , or more points in some athletic contest .
the Master said , &apos; Th@@ ou did@@ st thy best , that is success . &apos; &quot; from those things , and one other perhaps , I coined my own definition of success , which is : peace of mind at@@ tained only through self-@@ satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you &apos;re capable .
if you make the effort to do the best of which you &apos;re capable , trying to improve the situation that exists for you , I think that &apos;s success , and I don &apos;t think others can judge that ; it &apos;s like character and reputation -- your reputation is what you &apos;re perceived to be ; your character is what you really are .
and that gives you a great deal of pleasure , to see them go on .
so you must have patience , and I believe that we must have faith .
I believe that we must believe , truly believe .
not just give it word service , believe that things will work out as they should , providing we do what we should .
giving all , it seems to me , is not so far from victory .
sometimes I &apos;m asked who was the best player I had , or the best teams .
nevertheless , we spend the vast majority of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid , trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings , that are going to be very very difficult to address -- as we &apos;ve seen in the case of HIV .
Nathan Wol@@ fe : this species , yeah . and there &apos;s many many more pathogens that are present in these animals .
the blood will be tested for zo@@ on@@ otic viruses , part of a program Dr. Wol@@ fe has spent years setting up .
it &apos;s one that I think we all need to ask ourselves , which is , why we thought the responsibility rested with this individual here .
and let &apos;s face it , any new retro@@ virus in the human population -- it &apos;s something we should be aware of .
unfortunately , there aren &apos;t nearly enough donor organs available to fill that demand .
Alvin Ailey had the courage , right in the middle of the Civil Rights Movement , to present the truth about who we were -- that our creativity , our beauty , our intelligence , our talents were an intrinsic part of the pan@@ op@@ ly of American culture .
our mantra has always been to educate , to entertain , and to lift our audiences .
she made it , and she is , in that last step that she does , beating away anything negative with her tremendous strength .
now , now I get to the point . I want to talk about cars as art .
this is sick beyond belief .
well , what I didn &apos;t know was , and what we found out was -- these guys , they can &apos;t even like talk to each other under those conditions .
it was probably one of my better ti@@ ra@@ des , I have some good ones , but this was probably one of my better ones . and I went into these people ; how could they take BMW &apos;s money , how could they have a holiday for three months and produce nothing , nothing ?
you know , one is : just working without pressure .
( Laughter ) And it &apos;s &quot; me . &quot;
( Applause )
what release finally , the embrace : though we were wary -- it seemed so audacious -- how much unspoken joy there was in that affir@@ mation of equality and communi@@ on , no matter how much misunderstanding and pain had passed between you by then .
her five horri@@ d , deformed little dogs who incess@@ antly y@@ ap on the roof under my window .
no , more than impulse or fancy , the girl knows what she &apos;s doing , the girl means something , the girl means to mean , because it occurs to her in that instant , that beautiful or not , bright yes or no , she &apos;s not who she is , she &apos;s not the person she is , and the reason , she suddenly knows , is that there &apos;s been so much pre@@ meditation where she is , so much plotting and planning , there &apos;s hardly a person where she is , or if there is , it &apos;s not her , or not wholly her , it &apos;s a self inhabited , lived in by her , and seemingly even as she thinks it she knows what &apos;s been missing : grace , not pre@@ meditation but grace , a kind of being in the world spontaneously , with grace .
so it &apos;s enough to bury any industry .
sounds nice , but this can only buy time .
but the real hit was in Bulgaria .
why am I asking all of these business questions , instead of just showing them pages ?
( Laughter ) It &apos;s not possible to land a wing@@ suit yet .
all the ca@@ se@@ work is hand-@@ scribed in , uniquely , so you can &apos;t just cut 100 parts for 100 tra@@ ilers , you have to cut them big , and every single one is hand-@@ fit .
this is all real . so why don &apos;t we go ahead and start those pictures .
unlike an aircraft carrier or an atomic bomb , you don &apos;t need a massive manufacturing system to build robotics . a lot of it is off the shelf . a lot of it &apos;s even do-it-yourself .
we don &apos;t buy war bonds anymore .
in fact , my Rot@@ ten Tom@@ ato score is running around 50 percent right now , so I &apos;m not sure why they let me in .
or more it was like , birds .
it was like this grassroots uprising of making ourselves news .
love is the only thing that can stop a speeding bullet before it even exits the chamber .
and so , how do these nanoparticles manage to transport cancer drugs to the tumor ?
and so what other tools do nanoparticles have ?
and here we see the biological nanoparticles circulating in the blood .
I know you &apos;ve never heard of him , but just mark this day that someday you will hear of him , because he &apos;s really an amazing man . &quot;
but the reality is far from that , because in addition to our genes , our environment and lifestyle could have a significant role in developing many major diseases .
on the bright side , there are many other molecules in our body .
each one is different from the other one .
and by collecting more and more data about metabolites and understanding how changes in metabolites leads to developing diseases , our algorithms will get smarter and smarter to discover the right therapeutics for the right patients .
now dogs have an incredible sense of smell , but there &apos;s something more special about them : they have an ability to learn .
( Laughs ) Number three . OK .
( Applause ) There we go .
why ? because fear is a state of certainty .
and right about now , the activity in your prefrontal cortex is changing .
this idea is ev@@ oked most significantly in a vital law of physics : the total amount of quantum information in the Universe must be conserved .
others have suggested the paradox is just a misunderstanding of how general relativity and quantum field theory interact .
some of them are immigrants .
Fif@@ ty-five percent of this country &apos;s main businesses , the most successful businesses in this country , the unic@@ or@@ ns , are built by people who came as foreign students or as immigrants , and they &apos;re the founders or the co@@ founders .
we would have been at that bridge in Selma .
I don &apos;t have a clue .
we &apos;ve got 800 people in Tehran who watch TEDTalks .
( Applause ) Yes , yes .
and I saw that in northern China and in India .
and the good news is , we have technology that can do this .
using these membranes , which are commonly referred to as nan@@ of@@ il@@ tration membranes , now this five percent concentrated salty solution can be converted into a puri@@ fied salt solution .
so that &apos;s why pillar number three is so important .
Thank you .
when human knowledge has achieved a factor 10 to the 40 , it will pretty much control the entire galaxy , and will be looking beyond .
when I see these brave survivors struggling to connect again to their own self-worth , to their families , to their place in a society that values them , it is an honor to bear witness ; it is a privilege to seek justice .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s not that we can &apos;t do the math , it &apos;s that we can &apos;t feel the math .
and everyone in my office is pooling money to buy lottery tickets , and I &apos;m not having any of this .
what if they win ?
so I &apos;m thinking about things like , &quot; What material is ex@@ tran@@ eous ? &quot;
&quot; do the plot points reveal a theme ? &quot;
and if we take responsibility for our role in the story , we might just have to change .
and I want you to look at the supporting characters .
and it might be that because of her history , she &apos;s writing a singular story of betrayal , but there &apos;s probably something else that she &apos;s not willing to let me , in her letter , or maybe even herself , to see .
it narrows our perspectives .
( Laughter ) What they &apos;re really rejecting is an edit to their story of misery and st@@ uc@@ kness .
and learning that this World &apos;s Fair had music playing everywhere on its fair@@ grounds , I knew that live , immersive , spectacular musical theater , with the latest technologies of our time , is the closest experience that can bring the archi@@ val story of the 190@@ 1 fair out of boxes and into life .
they &apos;ve been here for billions of years , and what they are are single-celled microscopic organisms .
when it &apos;s alone , it doesn &apos;t make any light .
of course , I &apos;ve also told you that one of the important things they do is to initiate patho@@ gen@@ icity using quor@@ um sensing .
of course , what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular .
change isn &apos;t that easy .
but here &apos;s the best part .
I &apos;m in the business of safe@@ guarding secrets , and this includes your secrets .
and the fact that all the computing power on the planet combined can &apos;t solve it , that &apos;s the reason we cryptographers thought we &apos;d found a way to stay ahead of the code breakers for good .
perhaps we got a little co@@ cky because just when we thought the war was won , a bunch of 20th-century physicists came to the party , and they revealed that the laws of the universe , the same laws that modern cryptography was built upon , they aren &apos;t as we thought they were .
the conventional wisdom held by many leading physicists -- and you &apos;ve got to stay with me on this one -- is that each combination is actually examined by its very own quantum computer inside its very own parallel universe .
and we believe we &apos;ve found some geometric problems that just might do the trick .
in this particular case study I &apos;ll tell you about , there &apos;s a pharmacy , an online pharmacy .
you know , if you &apos;re very , very poor , you have no extra money , you live hand to mouth , and from time to time , bad things happen .
loss aversion is the idea that we hate losing more than we enjoy gaining .
people think loss aversion will have a small effect .
we have to , first of all , look at the system and see where there &apos;s little things we can fix , with friction , where is there that we can remove friction ?
but the really difficult inventions are the physical and chemical ones .
my answer to all these questions is : inspired inefficiency .
when he encountered a tough problem , he made a circuit of a trail , the sand@@ walk that he &apos;d built behind his house .
or we could learn from them how to design the kind of synthetic circuits that truly exploit the computational power of biochemistry .
but before they could even drop anchor , Tal@@ os spotted them .
as Me@@ de@@ a suspected , the bolt was a weak point in Hep@@ ha@@ est@@ us &quot; design .
here &apos;s what I discovered .
let me give you an example .
the most devastating blow we &apos;ve so far dealt our oceans is through overfishing .
what does protecting a long list of Latin species names mean to Res@@ ax@@ x , a woman from An@@ d@@ av@@ ado@@ aka who fishes every day to put food on the table and send her grandchildren to school ?
neighboring villages saw the fishing boom and drew up their own closures , spreading the model vir@@ ally along hundreds of miles of coastline .
there is no investment opportunity on earth that can reliably deliver what fisheries can .
now , a bit of economic history , I think , may be helpful here .
and compared with the official forecast , that oil will cost 26 dollars a barrel in 2025 , which is half of what we &apos;ve been paying lately , that will save 70 billion dollars a year , starting quite soon .
and we &apos;ll also get returns over 150 billion dollars a year .
the Gol@@ f was tot@@ aled .
those are the two hardest and cos@@ t@@ liest parts of making a car .
( Laughter ) But the interactivity allows the audience to shape what you &apos;re going to do as much as you shape their experience of the world .
and one of these is boundary crossing .
and another is , non-@@ op@@ positional strategies .
you know we &apos;re being penetrated .
and the mother goes right through a red light .
inside the opera , we have this lobby with a lot of natural light , and they can also enjoy this semi-@@ in@@ do@@ or-@@ outdoor space , and they can see the beautiful view around them .
so , you rather delete it ?
because they know , sooner or later , Facebook , YouTube , Twitter would take such content down .
what I wanted to talk to you about today is two things : one , the rise of a culture of availability ; and two , a request .
look around you .
they tended to show up on Christmas morning , so maybe they were made by the elves in Santa &apos;s workshop .
that &apos;s right , I said the chemists .
how do you think we get those bright , vivid colors that we love so much ?
and so we build roads that connect them all together .
if we could remove this roughness , then we can send the 5@@ G signal straight on through uninterrupted .
and as the internet grows , expanding media access and creation , preserving and reclaiming ancestral languages is now more possible than ever .
it &apos;s not working .
what is the cost of that battery ?
everybody tells us batteries are so expensive .
so in a sense this is an absolute zero-@@ carbon , zero-@@ fossil fuel electric mile at two cents a mile by 2020 .
that &apos;s one percent a year .
( Laughter ) He actually shared with me another story , which is from about 200 years ago .
but back in B@@ av@@ aria , law professor Adam We@@ is@@ ha@@ up@@ t &apos;s attempts to teach secular philosophy continued to be frustrated .
over time , they had grown into a semi-@@ secret , exclusive order that included many wealthy and influential individuals , with elaborate , secret initiation rituals .
but we also know that changing health behaviors is very difficult .
I &apos;ll call her Ms. Bertha .
and it &apos;s going to be used for diet as well , and nutritional supplements and such .
and look around you and know that what we really care about is that little bit of difference .
it would change absolutely everything .
and it &apos;s obvious to anyone , that if we can do this , we absolutely will do this , whatever the consequences are .
are you going to be able to resist that if it doesn &apos;t have any overt side effects ?
that &apos;s really the central one , I believe .
it &apos;s going to drive these things from view .
the one thing though that is really dangerous about these sorts of technologies , is that it &apos;s easy to become seduced by them .
and to use our advanced technologies to pull out what is beneficial from this sea of noise , basically .
to me it &apos;s an incredible privilege to be alive now and to be able to witness this thing .
and as a biologist , I &apos;m not advocating for these types of ruthless neoliberal market dynamics enacted by the fungi .
but both of us dropped our selection and walked away .
destroying the Amazon does not affect just the indigenous people , because we are all connected .
so I &apos;m thinking , what are they thinking about me and my team ?
and we never would have thought of them by ourselves , without the ED@@ F team .
so I end up meeting her , and she &apos;s the very best type of critic , in a sense that she just loves the animals , wants to protect them , but she also understands the reality of the meat business .
show them the back room .
hand paddles , everything .
the body is denser than water . 95 percent of it would be , at least , submerged naturally .
but no , you &apos;d be wrong because my body is very poorly designed for most things -- pretty well designed for lifting heavy rocks perhaps .
especially with fears you gained when you were a child .
friction climbing doesn &apos;t have any sort of hard positive edges .
rule number five : know how to rest .
and it &apos;s a project that we &apos;ve actually been now joined by hundreds of people around the world , who are doing it with us . indeed thousands of people have actually been involved in this project , in many of its different aspects .
and I went and put a little announcement up on our site , asking for people to join us in this enterprise .
why on earth are you cro@@ che@@ ting a reef ?
and they have different properties .
there is , there &apos;s a third alternative .
thinking , how can that be ? you &apos;re cheating . the lines are curved .
even mathematicians , who in some sense are the fre@@ est of all thinkers , literally couldn &apos;t see not only the sea slu@@ gs around them , but the lettuce on their plate -- because lettuces , and all those cur@@ ly vegetables , they also are embodi@@ ments of hyperbolic geometry .
so this project really has taken on this inner organic life of its own .
Thank you very much .
K stands for the number of times a cycle of reasoning is repeated .
they &apos;re eager to learn English , and their children serve in the US military all over the world . &quot;
here , we need some back@@ story , which is where my history training comes in .
when you find yourself alone in an ocean , with your thoughts , the dangers that you face are not just external , like whales , sharks , jellyfish or even demo@@ tiv@@ ating people .
so that it was something that just got into your spirit .
you couldn &apos;t transfer those to the model itself .
if you wanted it to fly you had to learn the discipline of flying .
and I chose chairs specifically because I knew something about them .
there are some very light people , some extremely heavy people , maybe people with a lot of bulk up top .
( Laughter ) So he said , &quot; Well I &apos;ll come over and look at it . &quot;
( Laughter ) I had one for a wrist@@ watch once . 20 pages .
all these conditions share symptoms of joint pain and inflammation , but the origin and severity of those symptoms vary widely .
it &apos;s a general misconception that arthritis is confined to old age .
the day after my 50th birthday , I climbed aboard a Russian capsule , in Russia , and launched into space .
therefore , this is a great place for me to place all these commercials that are female-@@ centric and maybe not other things . &quot;
and it is our belief that if you want to find disruptive growth in the market , you have to go to the consumer and take a very agnostic view of the consumer .
are we kind of stigma@@ tizing people from Arkansas , and this part of the country ?
our 14@@ -year collaboration , &quot; The No@@ tion of Family , &quot; was created out of our struggle to survive environmental racism , healthcare inequity and chemical emissions that were being dereg@@ ulated and released from the United States Ste@@ el Corporation , making Brad@@ dock the town with the highest asthma and infant mortality rates in the country .

I teach at Lincoln High School in Lincoln , Ne@@ br@@ as@@ ka , and we are one of the oldest and most diverse high schools in our state .
we have to be able to build relationships with and among our students to help them feel connected in a world that depends on it .
they invite in community yoga teachers , they sponsor walks around the neighborhood during lunch and organize social events that are all meant to bring people together .
for most of human history , a burst appendix could be a death sentence .

once you &apos;ve seen problems like this , you can &apos;t un@@ see them , so you have to ask others to help you to solve them .
and you can see this in a typical hero meeting .
interdependent leaders , on the other hand , understand that they need other people .
Go@@ j@@ ek is worth 10 billion dollars .
and Gra@@ b , well , they pushed out Uber out of the whole region of Southeast Asia .
today , the company enjoys 500 stores with 8,000 employees .
in the community called &quot; S@@ lam D@@ unk , &quot; people from different cities , different departments , different levels of the organization , they would talk about how these characters inspired them at work .
so I &apos;m here to tell you a story of success from Africa .
so in the past five years , we developed a proprietary cleaning technology that allows us to eliminate all contaminants .
how little do we know sometimes that we are , as a nation , the biggest recycler of plastics and waste , if not just plastic , and we didn &apos;t know this about our own country .
and I realized it &apos;s not just made of models and classi@@ fiers for the neural network .
so with this project , I thought about the gaze of the machine , and I began to think about vision as multidimensional , as views from somewhere .
and after presenting it to a number of people that we were getting buy-in with , we were actually asked to present to the global CEO at his annual strategy meet that happened over a week .
pe@@ ars dried in the form of genital organs .
the stranger kept building , S@@ v@@ adi@@ l@@ fari kept hauling , and neither snow nor rain could slow their progress .
they wondered why they &apos;d made such a foolish w@@ ager - and then remembered Loki and his terrible advice .

surgeons then lift the flap to expose the inside of the cornea .
they recognized that nuclear risk reduction was far too important to allow it to succumb to political partisanship .
we debate all sorts of issues that are critically important to our lives -- why should nuclear weapons be any different ?
so I teach people how to do the thing I &apos;m good at , because the more people that learn how to be good at my end of this work , the more work will get done .
grew up poor ? baggage .
mad or en@@ vious that other people have more money than you ?
and you know why ?
because guess what I know now .
I worked with this CEO once , and I was hired to teach him how to talk to human people , like a human person .
you just have to respect the people and the process , and do the work .
an enzyme is a protein that &apos;s a catalyst , it speeds up or accelerates a chemical reaction , just as the ch@@ ymosin over here is accelerating the cur@@ d@@ ling of the milk .
while enzymes do play an important role in the foods that we eat , they also are involved in everything from the health of an infant to attacking the biggest environmental challenges we have today .
and , to me , what &apos;s really the fun part is trying to design an enzyme for a new application , arranging the atoms just so .
without thinking , I fired off a bunch of tweets , challenging them and saying were they really serious about this .
they know when the water is way too deep , and they &apos;re not afraid to ask for advice .
here is just a little bit of data .
and it will be some months before@@ ward , and we see a long steady progression of the evolution from the first wi@@ ggles , to rolling over , and sitting up , and crawling , standing , walking , before we get to that magical point in which we can mot@@ ate in the world .
now we study this , as the nerdy , laboratory , univer@@ sit@@ y-based scientists that we are , by engaging the brains of animals like rats , or monkeys , or of this particularly curious creature -- one of the more bizarre forms of life on earth -- to engage them in learning new skills and abilities .
what are you doing by operating on the c@@ left palate to correct it ?
actually , probably about 15,000 children are being trained as we speak .
maybe there could be four or five places in the world where you send in your digital blueprint and the DNA comes back , right ?
you know , I couldn &apos;t have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl .

we named this object Sedna after the Inuit goddess of the sea , in honor of the cold , icy places where it spends all of its time .
they &apos;re all looking at something .
LB : not only has Pablo been talking publicly for the first time about being an orphan , but together , we started a live storytelling series we &apos;re calling Talk R@@ x , and it &apos;s become a really popular place for his peers to show their most vulnerable and powerful thoughts and feelings .
results seem to last up to a month .

so if Ethic can find the original 0 bot and somehow change its instructions , she could take over the entire army , all at once .
look at the options again .
how do we know the first statement is more likely to be true ?
in November that year , there was an international summit there .
now I &apos;m not saying that officials have no responsibility here , but it is our collective apathy that takes the pressure off of our parliam@@ ent@@ arians , the bureaucrats or the enforcement agencies .
it mimics what we now understand about reconstructing the 1918 flu virus , the last great pandemic , in that it also jumped directly from birds to people .
add on pandemic threat , you &apos;re in big trouble .
but actually in scientific community there is great debate about what percentage of flu transmission between people is from sneezing and coughing and what percentage is on your hands .
in the SARS epidemic , we learned in Hong Kong that most of transmission was because people were removing their masks impro@@ per@@ ly .
most of the death toll was 15 to 40 year-olds -- robu@@ stly healthy young adults .
Lau@@ rie G@@ arre@@ t : what factors determine the duration of a pandemic , we don &apos;t really know .
and it won &apos;t do any good to bring in the tanks and the artillery because those T-@@ cells don &apos;t recognize it either .
a national highway construction boom was added to our problems .
the South Bronx , which lies in between , did not stand a chance .
the community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway .
both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another .
but we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out .
take an AI engine rejecting a student application for university .
our team trained a model in a few weeks , on past sales data , and the competition was organized with human buyers .
there is no other way .
more than 75 percent expressed real concerns on the impact of AI on the workforce , on privacy , on the risk of a dehuman@@ ized society .
when a girl rejects her body , she rejects her only house and invisibility and insecurity become her very shaky foundation .
it &apos;s not a personal fault , it &apos;s training , and I think that &apos;s the biggest revelation is that , if we stop pretending , then the world changes .
SRK : do you girls all agree with what Deep@@ a is saying ?
it &apos;s nothing if not ambitious .

they see acceleration as widening the gap between the ha@@ ves , the jet@@ -@@ set@@ ters who are buzzing around , and the have-@@ no@@ ts , who are left in the digital dust .

but sometimes , it leads us astray in the long run .
what happens is that when light impacts the retina at the back of our eye at night it can disrupt mel@@ at@@ on@@ in production , and when mel@@ at@@ on@@ in production is disrupted , a whole chain of other chemical processes are affected , and that includes estrogen production .
and let &apos;s talk about LED lights .
over the next 4,@@ 700 years , farmers bred the plant into a staple crop , with larger co@@ bs and edible ker@@ nels .
and the rise of mono@@ culture farming has left our food supply dangerously vulnerable to pests and pathogens - a single virus could infect the world &apos;s supply of this ubiquitous crop .
Thank you .
they &apos;re ingenious , perhaps , but not analytical . &quot;
I wondered about infinity and the Big Bang theory .
it &apos;s foolish just like trying to choose between being realistic or idealistic .

for the first time , I identified as somebody living with depression , and I felt good about it -- like I wasn &apos;t a bad person for it .
( Laughter ) Don &apos;t take a negative response personally .
and my last suggestion is : interact about not depression , aka , normal stuff .
that is truly remarkable .

in addition , these types of social-@@ media misinformation campaigns can spread what has been called &quot; genoci@@ dal propaganda , &quot; for instance against the Ro@@ h@@ ing@@ ya in Burma , triggering mob killings in India .

and so what we have today is an ultra@@ financi@@ alized industrial sector where , increasingly , a share of the profits and the net income are not actually going back into production , into human capital training , into research and development but just being siph@@ oned out in terms of buying back your own shares , which boos@@ ts stock options , which is , in fact , the way that many executives are getting paid .
in Bhutan , also , they &apos;re thinking about happiness and well-being indicators .

researchers are still developing more precise interventions that only target the intended cancer cells .
as food became plentiful here , it also meant that we were able to decrease the number of people working in agriculture to something like , on average , in the high income countries , five percent or less of the population .
and the wh@@ iter the bread , in many countries , the better it is .
if we do this , if we want to stay with traditional small-scale farming we are going , actually , to rele@@ gate these poor farmers and their husbands -- among whom I have lived for many years , working without electricity and water , to try to improve their food production -- we rele@@ gate them to poverty .
one of our problems is that world food production needs to increase very rapidly -- doubling by about 2030 .
what I want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there but go to a kind of regional scale -- not just in terms of the scale of the fields , but in terms of the entire food network .
and above all , to me , food is about respect .
they pop into our head when we don &apos;t want them to .
and it &apos;s expected to increase even more dramatically going forward .

therefore India is at a critical point where either it can leverage its demographic dividend or it can lead to a demographic disaster .
that is leading to a lot of problems which we need to address .
that is why I think all of you should be equally concerned with it as I am .

the EPA estimates that food waste has more than doubled between 1970 and 2017 , and now accounts for 27 percent of everything in our landfills .

how are people supposed to have any kind of common understanding or know how to move together into the future ?
how do we understand what the other person is thinking ? &quot;
there isn &apos;t an organization which is connecting the independent voices of the world to get out there , and yet I &apos;m hearing throughout this conference that the biggest challenge in our future is understanding the other , and having mutual respect for the other and crossing borders .

and thinking that , can an individual actually do something , or come up with something , that may actually get some traction out there and make a difference ?
but what I think it was telling me is that we are this transient thing that &apos;s happening , and that the nature that you see out there -- the untouched sho@@ rel@@ ines , the untouched forest that I was able to see -- really bring in a sense of that geological time , that this has gone on for a long time , and we &apos;re experiencing it in a different way .
and that , to me , was a reference point that I think I needed to have to be able to make the work that I did .
and I thought , &quot; My God , wouldn &apos;t that be something ? &quot;
there &apos;s a massive back@@ log of people wanting their jobs .
it took me five fake tries because they were just going . to slow them down was literally impossible .
this is certainly connected to California and Silicon Valley .
so part of my thinking , and part of my wishes , is sitting with these thoughts in mind , and thinking about , &quot; How is their life going to be when they want to have children , or when they &apos;re ready to get married 20 years from now -- or whatever , 15 years from now ? &quot;
but what &apos;s even more amazing , really , than this fantastic scale of progress , is that -- look at how predictable this is .
at least the exponential growth of information technology capability will continue un@@ ab@@ ated .

no , I &apos;m just kidding , I &apos;m not going to do that to you .
I was from a good family , I was always dressed nicely , had a smile on my face , I was prepared for school .
my parents didn &apos;t know , and I had not told anyone else .
and the day came where I was in the room with my abuser and one other adult .
because the things they say , the facial expressions that they give me , the things they don &apos;t say can become red flags for me and can help me figure out what their needs are .
their story is worth telling .
but they are dividing up areas and blocking corridors .
so we &apos;re having a great reduction both in elephant crop raids and a boost in yield through the pollination services that the bees are giving to the crops themselves .
in the distance , on an otherwise uninhabited island , lo@@ omed large black letters that spelled the word &quot; FO@@ RE@@ V@@ ER . &quot;
so we have to try these devices out because the FDA won &apos;t just let us use them on people unless we try it out first , and the best model for this happens to be pigs .
second of all , I &apos;ll bet even you people who are un@@ trained can see the difference , and we see here an ST segment elevation right after this sharp line .
but when it comes to the sake of a human , we can save their life .
the advantages of responsive neuros@@ tim@@ ulation : it can detect and ter@@ minate seizures before the clinical symptoms occur , provide stimulation only when needed , can be turned off if seizures disappear ; it has minimal side effects -- as a matter of fact , in all our clinical trials to date , we &apos;ve seen no side effects in the 40 or so patients in whom it &apos;s been implanted -- and it &apos;s invisible , cos@@ me@@ tically hidden , so , if you have epilepsy and you have the device , no one will know it because you can &apos;t tell that it &apos;s there .
then we stimulated , and you see how that heavy black line and then you see the electro@@ ence@@ ph@@ alo@@ gram signal going to normal , which means they did not get the epileptic seizure .
that conclu@@ des my discussion of epilepsy , which is the third invention that I want to discuss here this afternoon .
and that is the second wish .
( Laughter ) And Freud in part reflects the anatomy of the human emotion system -- which is that we have both a positive and a negative system , and our negative system is extremely sensitive .
it &apos;s sort of &quot; me , &quot; not &quot; we . &quot;
but it &apos;s not irrelevant .
they abandoned the log boat base for a ke@@ el plank , and the boats became higher and more sea@@ worthy .
when not at war , the vessels were used to transport goods and make trade journeys .
( speaks Spanish ) Many years have passed since my childhood , but throughout my formal studies , I found myself drawing in the margins of my notebooks instead of paying attention to my professors .
they have no tolerance for any freedom of expression or free thinking .
they are inspired by mus@@ es of mythology , as well as classical , modern and paleo@@ lithic tales .
( speaks Spanish ) I felt stuck , I really didn &apos;t know what to draw in this historic moment .
and I knew that I couldn &apos;t allow my happiness to see@@ p into my work , that I should take the higher road and respect people &apos;s grief .
so there it comes down . there is a gecko at the end of that trajectory line .
so now we can continue this mu@@ tu@@ alism by suggesting that they can make an active tail .
so somewhere here , we were forcing our choices on them .
( Laughter ) And everybody loved this option that had a lo@@ ft in it , simply because it did two things .
one is that it accommodated larger families to sleep in .
they move them into vertical housing , which in reality looks like this .
and yeah , the black cloud faded a little bit , but so did all the work , because I was just floating along . I couldn &apos;t care less if clients ever called .
but it wasn &apos;t a quick trip .
I &apos;ve also lived in Biosphere 2 .
( Laughter ) Over the top it was sealed with steel and glass , underneath it was sealed with a pan of steel -- essentially entirely sealed .
for two years I &apos;d been seeing people through the glass .
around the world today we &apos;re seeing an incredible transformation , from what I would call a bio@@ ci@@ dal species , one that -- whether we intentionally or un@@ intentionally -- have designed our systems to kill life , a lot of the time .
the small stuff counts .
that means if the fiber re@@ models its walls too early , it will be short , and ultimately make rough , weak fabrics .
so I said , &quot; OK , tell me about him . &quot;

and so this has become my mission of sorts , which is that I take insights from psychology and I translate them into resources and tools to support those working on the front@@ lines to turn things around .

we didn &apos;t have Google , we didn &apos;t have web cra@@ w@@ lers , we didn &apos;t have computers .
but in that year , smallpox exploded throughout India .
you can &apos;t cure or prevent what you don &apos;t know is there .
first of all , just so everyone understands : you &apos;re saying that by creating web cra@@ w@@ lers , looking on the Internet for patterns , they can detect something suspicious before WHO , before anyone else can see it ?

Hedge can count the letters in each stack and organize them into a dictionary , which is a tidy way of storing information .
cellular machinery is then used to basically glue two ends of the DNA back together .
overnight , four young apprenti@@ ces broke into the temple &apos;s inner chamber to steal the sacred element crystals .
that would allow us to confirm that our initial guess was wrong and work from there .
some assumptions might not lead to contradictions without making further assumptions .

they moved on to some other situation .
and then the third key actor is the post-conflict government .
so we have to be disciplined and focus on things that are critical .
basically , prices soar and crooked politicians then milk the r@@ ents from the sector , but it doesn &apos;t generate any jobs .
so that &apos;s the focus on the construction sector .
it &apos;s affecting our brain as well .
and in the last 10 years of history , the research about the relationship between air pollution and our brain &apos;s health has been increased dramatically , so maybe now our brain is going up in smoke .
so , almost everybody is exposed to air pollution .
and it &apos;s driven and propelled forward by new leaders , like many of the people here , by new tools , like the ones we &apos;ve seen here , and by new pressures .
wiser sets out to document , link and empower what Paul calls the largest movement , and fastest-growing movement in human history : humanity &apos;s collective immune response to today &apos;s threats .

now , what &apos;s really interesting here is that we &apos;re not thinking our way into a new way of acting ; we &apos;re acting our way into a new way of thinking .

and then , fast-forward 10 years later , and there is an American scientist , and she is looking through her microscope , also at insect cells .
and -- and I had to learn this -- but when I &apos;m talking about &quot; sex &quot; here , I &apos;m talking about the way biology gives us gonads , which are our ovaries and our testes -- I &apos;m not talking about gender , which is how we identify .
they never investigated whether they had higher rates of violence .
she was like a hot shot , a rising superstar .
and in this instance you see how , if you assign sex to a specific place in the body , or at least , like , this is what I saw , right ?
it &apos;s the only profession where you have to believe in the future .
it is actually a living connection to the cosmic event that we are part of , and a story that is certainly ongoing .

and often it takes just a building to change our experience of what could be done , what has been done , how the world has remained both in between stability and instability .
it &apos;s an art of communication .
it &apos;s about carving out a space for trees .
so democracy , as difficult as it is , I believe in it .
and yet , compromise , consensus , that is what I believe in .
you can , it turns out , be in two places at once .
anybody who ever gave anything to Africa got a lot more back .
and it was a funny kind of sick feeling , but I turned him down .
even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford .
in fact , a head of state that you &apos;re all familiar with admitted this to me . and it &apos;s really true .
but think about it .
we believe that this could be the time when the world finally decides that the wan@@ ton loss of life in Africa is just no longer acceptable .

they have a lot of respect , as I do , for Dr. Martin King .
and I wonder if that is really justice for them , to get their rights in that way .
I mean , like even when I told my wife that you want to come out here and talk to me , she &apos;s like , &apos; She &apos;s just talking ; she &apos;s just being nice to you . she &apos;s not going to do that . &apos; &quot; and then you called me up and you said you wanted to come out here and interview me and she went and looked you up on the Internet .
over the past 70 years , the number of barriers between countries has doubled .
it &apos;s the mental wall which keeps cities on the other side far away , and the higher and stronger this mental wall , the more difficult they seem to be reached .
borders are important because you can provide to people arriving from areas that might be at risk of having had infection , provide them with an understanding , either a printed understanding or a verbal understanding , of what the signs and symptoms are of this infection , and what they should do if they feel that they might be infected .

so what about 64 percent of women in St. Louis , Missouri , who weren &apos;t able to afford menstrual hygiene supplies in the previous year ?
she was so appalled by what was happening in Austria as a result of the First World War and what was happening to children who were part of the defeated families of Austria , that in Britain she wanted to take action , but she had to go house to house , leaflet to leaflet , to get people to attend a rally in the Royal Albert Hall that eventually gave birth to Save the Children , an international organization that is now fully recognized as one of the great institutions in our land and in the world .
I was sitting next to Nelson Mandela -- I was very privileged to do so -- when Amy W@@ ine@@ house came onto the stage . ( Laughter ) And Nelson Mandela was quite surprised at the appearance of the singer and I was explaining to him at the time who she was .

the segment of the American Jewish population that had the highest frequency of Tay-Sachs carriers traced their descent to those European countries where the incidence of TB was highest .
proximate explanations for health conditions consider the immediate factors : what &apos;s going on inside someone &apos;s body right now that caused a particular problem .
understanding that your health is affected not just by what &apos;s going on in your body right now , but also by your genetic inheritance , culture and history , can help you make more informed decisions about predispos@@ itions , risks and treatments .
the government won &apos;t report black@@ outs on the news .

more stress .
so what , why do you care ?
it made it difficult for me to complain .
but something very valuable in that idea , nevertheless .
if you open the newspaper any day of the week , it &apos;s full of people who &apos;ve messed up their lives .
and so we tend to worship ourselves . our heroes are human heroes .
most other societies have had , right at their center , the worship of something transcendent : a god , a spirit , a natural force , the universe , whatever it is -- something else that is being wor@@ shi@@ ped .
or do you think that you can &apos;t , but it doesn &apos;t matter that much that we &apos;re putting too much emphasis on that ?
in early 2016 , I met my physical therapist , and after a few really grueling sessions , she must have sensed something , because she pulled me aside and said , &quot; You know , you should do a half marathon .
and all of a sudden , that friend group happens and you start to settle in .

that would be very sad .
so the third thing that might happen is a very beautiful thing .
so as other countries in the world innov@@ ated , in the sense both of developing newer technologies , but also developing newer rules , the Chinese were cut off from those advances .
so let &apos;s talk about how this could play out in practice .
there is less precedent for that , but that could easily be worked out .
so the incentives for the people helping to construct this zone and build it , and set up the basic rules , go very much in the right direction .
I have a master &apos;s degree in International Health .
there &apos;s logistical reasons for that , and there &apos;s medical reasons .
we saw in the Ebola outbreak that as soon as you put a quarantine in place , people start trying to evade it .
I want to close here with some personal advice .
wash your hands .
if you &apos;re sick , your face mask holds in all your coughing and sneezing and protects the people around you .
&#91; question 2 : if containment isn &apos;t enough , what comes next ? &#93; in that respect , it would be about massive changes in our social interactions .
because if you imagine that &apos;s where you can get a virus out and onto surfaces and onto hands and onto faces , and it &apos;s really situations like that we &apos;ve got to think more about .
it &apos;s a waterborne disease , not something that &apos;s in the air .

this happens every year .
they &apos;ve borrowed the recipe from the coral reef , and they &apos;re using CO2 as a building block in cement , in concrete .
they export water molecules through , and leave solu@@ tes on the other side .

but I don &apos;t know why I don &apos;t hate their music .
here I am in the West . I choose not to .
that &apos;s a useful starting place because we now know that any viable offering to the sea monsters must be a multiple of 10@@ 01 .

I wanted to have humor , beauty , simplicity and complexity and use metaphors to suggest ideas .
as a street performer , I have learned that everybody wants to connect .
now , I know that many of you don &apos;t stop to think about diversity in agricultural systems and , let &apos;s face it , that &apos;s logical .
it &apos;s a bit of a personal example , in fact .
and there are a couple of answers to that question .
so , in a very real sense , I believe that we , as an international community , should get organized to complete the task .

and when people aren &apos;t allowed to be useful , they soon think that they &apos;re useless .
and I &apos;m a very small part of a very large movement , which for some people is about survival , but is also about values , about a different kind of economy , which isn &apos;t so much about consumption and credit , but about things which matter to us .
environmental services , energy services , the myriad of green jobs , they &apos;re all pointing to a very different kind of economy which isn &apos;t just about products , but is using distributed networks , and it &apos;s founded above all on care , on relationships , on what people do to other people , often one to one , rather than simply selling them a product .
our societies now spend two , three , four percent of GDP to invest systematically in new discovery , in science , in technology , to fuel the pipeline of brilliant inventions which illuminate gatherings like this .

my children were now in a school where they couldn &apos;t speak the language , and I thought the deal for all this disruption to my world was that I would have some degree of control over what was going to happen .

we just had 33 cameras shoot about half an hour ago all across the northern hemisphere , watching what &apos;s happened .
similarly , a lot of art projects stay in the art community , and I feel very much a responsibility through mechanisms like TED , and like our relationship with the Obama White House , with the Senate , with John Kerry , to influence policy as much as possible with these pictures as well .

the cell &apos;s membrane collapses and those spike proteins crumble .
in either method , the actual process of destroying the virus happens in just a second or two .
not necessarily .
so what do we do ?
well , one issue is that radical innovation , when you &apos;ve got ideas that affect a large number of technologies or people , have a great deal of uncertainty attached to them .
more and more , the inventors of things will not be able to say that in advance .

where Grace thought the powder was sugar , because it was labeled &quot; sugar &quot; and by the coffee machine , but actually the powder was poison .
and what I &apos;m going to show you is what happened when we look inside the brains of people while they &apos;re making that judgment .
so what I &apos;m showing you , from left to right , is how much activity there was in this brain region , and from top to bottom , how much blame people said that Grace deserved .
and what you can see is , on the left when there was very little activity in this brain region , people paid little attention to her innocent belief and said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident .
also the police and courts use them to determine whether one is a potential criminal or is likely to recomm@@ it a crime .

the first step towards that goal for me was to assemble a giant team of artists and elders and caregivers in one care facility in Milwaukee .
together , over two years , we tackled reimagining the story of Homer &apos;s &quot; Odyssey . &quot;
at each meeting , there &apos;s way too many ideas .
the design process was really tough , almost like a struggle for survival , but gradually an idea evolved : this sort of idea of a rational tower that melts together with the surrounding city , sort of expanding the public space onto what we refer to as a Scandin@@ avian version of the Spanish Ste@@ ps in Rome , but sort of public on the outside , as well as on the inside , with the library .
we scaled the building up three times to Chinese proportions , and went to China .

and events like the COVID-19 pandemic have shown that they &apos;re even more essential than we thought .
CA : and applying it to thinking about offices coming back -- I mean , it seems to me that , as we &apos;ve already seen , there &apos;s a lot of productivity that can happen when you &apos;re at home , so you could picture on this idea of people doing one set of things during the four days when they &apos;re , say , back at the office , doing the exposure to each other , sparking off each other , the discussions , the brainstorming , all that good stuff , while at home , they &apos;re then doing all the things that we &apos;ve been doing the last few weeks , kind of working solo .
in the first , governments and communities do nothing to halt the spread and instead allow people to be exposed as quickly as possible .
its legacy will be long-lasting , but not all bad ; the breakthroughs , social services , and systems we develop can be used to the betterment of everyone .
so I am going to be talking about hallucinations and a particular sort of visual hallucination , which I see among my patients .

the test won &apos;t reveal heritage from people not represented in the database , and shouldn &apos;t be used to prove race or ethnicity .
in areas where access to good primary and secondary education are limited and employment opportunities are scarce , a small skill base is inevitable .
this works really well on the production line , where work can be syste@@ ma@@ tized around clear procedural instructions and then reinforced through training .

so we &apos;re starting with a variety of technologies that have conver@@ ged into these conversational character robots that can see faces , make eye contact with you , make a full range of facial expressions , understand speech and begin to model how you &apos;re feeling and who you are , and build a relationship with you .
one is hierarchical pores , and the other is a macro-@@ molecular nanoscale por@@ osity in the material .
we &apos;re working with the Machine Per@@ ception Laboratory at the U.@@ C. San Diego .
but that would have ended up with a lot of awful kick@@ back and a hell of a lot of resistance .
yet we &apos;ve never created the opportunity for impulse saving .
one of them is , &quot; Po@@ etry is when you make new things familiar and familiar things new . &quot;
and when you think of the fabric of the brain , the structure , how is it built ? what is the pattern of the carpet ?
you may have many different types of trees , but every pine tree is different . and in the brain it &apos;s the same .
so , in summary , I think that the universe may have -- it &apos;s possible -- evolved a brain to see itself , which may be a first step in becoming aware of itself .
this really happened .
and the third boy said , &quot; Frank sent this . &quot;
( Laughter ) Actually , we lived in a place called S@@ nit@@ ter@@ field , just outside Str@@ at@@ ford , which is where Shakespeare &apos;s father was born .
music is the most powerful form of sound that we know that affects our emotional state . ( Al@@ bin@@ oni &apos;s Ad@@ ag@@ io ) This is guaranteed to make most of you feel pretty sad if I leave it on .
the third way in which sound affects you is cognitively .
we have a very small amount of bandwidth for processing auditory input , which is why noise like this ...
at last we &apos;ve got some science we can apply .
the global commons had still enough capacity to take the punches we gave them .
all of them told me that they can &apos;t make the change by themselves , and only by working together under a kind of new contract , or a new practice , do they have a chance to protect tropical forests .
and yet , at the same time , this very well may be a seminal moment in American history , an opportunity for the consumer to actually take control and guide us to a new trajectory in America .
complete transparency .
continuing education is up .
and then we look at what companies can do .
if you take a look at these scans that we have of Emily , you can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things as it goes into different facial expressions .
Emily : image Me@@ trics is a mar@@ ker@@ less , performan@@ ce-@@ driven animation company .
and in front of all that noise , you do a very small gesture .
now , who should we thank for the success ?
did you see the hands ?
audience : ( claps ) ( Laughter ) It@@ ay T@@ alg@@ am : why not together ? ( Laughter ) Because you didn &apos;t know when to play .
I &apos;m opening a space for you to put in another layer of interpretation . &quot;
first of all , it &apos;s a kind of a compliment we all like to get .
now , if you are doing all the things we talked about , together , and maybe some others , you can get to this wonderful point of doing without doing .
( Laughter ) We teach our children &quot; the talk &quot; about biology and mechanics , about pregnancy and safe sex , and that &apos;s what our kids grow up thinking that sex is pretty much all about .
so I curled up next to her and I dri@@ zzled sand on her other arm and then her legs .
the reuse of syringes now exceeds that and kills 1.3 million people a year .
you give the injection and then put it down .
Thank you very much .
the future , as we know it , is very unpredictable .
but there is an underbelly .
that &apos;s what the experience of the last 20 years has been .
and parallel universes ?
brains only detect nerve impulses .
and that &apos;s possible because the details of the original myth are unrelated to seasons , except via the myth itself .
we are using our interdisciplinary approach to show how universities , NGOs and private business can partner in international development .
this is not sustainable .
it is able to move around its environment .
we don &apos;t just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals .
but what do we really know about mosquitoes ?
a new approach .
it means that if we can map all these locations across villages , we could actually crush these populations by just a single blow .
the African Union has set a goal of 2030 to eliminate malaria from the continent .
an essay I &apos;d written about my father , the year before he died , was in Tim &apos;s new book .
( Applause )
the other half of the audience doesn &apos;t like head-tail-tail -- they think , for deep cultural reasons , that &apos;s boring -- and they &apos;re much more interested in a different pattern -- head-tail-head .
who thinks that B is true -- that on average , they &apos;re the same ?
there &apos;s a much deeper connection , which I don &apos;t have time to go into and that is that modern genetics is a really exciting area of science .
and I will give you two little snippets -- two examples -- of projects we &apos;re involved in in my group in Oxford , both of which I think are rather exciting .
so he said , &quot; I &apos;ll assume that if you have one cot death in a family , the chance of a second child dying from cot death aren &apos;t changed . &quot;
so , the night before that du@@ el , he realized this possibly is his last chance to try and explain his great breakthrough .
it looks like it did before it started .
it seems mad to talk about nothing .
so , this object has six symmetries .
and there is some symmetry here in the way the symmetries interact with each other .
now , let &apos;s move to the very differ@@ ent-@@ looking wall in the Alhambra .
so , like Sno@@ opy , we can &apos;t just lie there and think great thoughts about our neighbors .
and , as many people do , he was do@@ zing off during the sermon .
he looked at the rich man . he held the rich man &apos;s hands and said , &quot; Don &apos;t you understand ? &quot; he said , &quot; These are the hands of God . &quot;
it needs the help of mother , or a foster mother , to survive .
the winner boxes the air and kisses the ground , throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it .
it &apos;s experienced by people occasionally .
by mandate , you cannot make a person compassionate .
I will come to it later .
now , it was not always wonderful at that table .
and whatever else is needed , I will provide it and pay for it when I return . &quot;
and those of you who are employers know exactly what I mean .
one is asking for angu@@ r -- one is , say , an Engli@@ sh@@ man -- one is asking for ene@@ b , and one is asking for grapes .
the animals are in one of their human lives . the humans are human .
so , that &apos;s the way the Buddhists do it .
and then the next thing we do is what is called &quot; mother recognition . &quot;
at the same time , I think religions don &apos;t deserve all the credit .
good , because before I tell you about that good news , I &apos;m going to have to take a little ex@@ cur@@ sion through some academic terrain .
you &apos;ve probably heard the term &quot; interdependence &quot; applied to the modern world . well , that &apos;s just another term for non-zero-sum .
and you see this all the time in the modern world .
certainly , a couple of things are that , first of all , there are a lot of zero-sum situations in the world .
because what happened in the beginning , this stuff en@@ cases itself in a cell , then cells start hanging out together in societies .
generations go by , somebody says , hey , why don &apos;t we put it on a stick ?
so , until then , basically people were living on top of their trades .
groups like Buil@@ d@@ safe UA@@ E have emerged , but the numbers are simply overwhelming .
and when one student like me has some sort of incl@@ ination or understanding about that molecule , they write one scientific paper on the subject .
and I know that oil comes from the ocean and phytoplankton , but he did the calculations for our Earth and what it had to do to produce that amount of energy .
and together they only form about 15 years of supply .
among all these experiments , there was one thing in common : I was trying to bring a part of the physical world to the digital world .
but then I realized that we humans are not actually interested in computing .
because pixels are actually , right now , confined in these rectangular devices that fit in our pockets .
but we are not only tracking one finger , here .
( Applause ) When I &apos;m going back , I can just use my boarding pass to check how much my flight has been delayed , because at that particular time , I &apos;m not feeling like opening my iPhone , and checking out a particular icon .
here , I &apos;m taking a part of a document , and putting over here a second part from a second place , and I &apos;m actually modifying the information that I have over there .
companies like mobi@@ le-@@ phone operators want to take this in a different way than the NGOs in India , thinking , &quot; Why can we only have &apos; Six@@ th Sense &apos; ?
we will provide all the open source software for them , maybe starting next month .

in Venezuela , one of the most popular soap operas has a hero@@ ine called Crystal .
some whistled well .
why ? because that was the moment when the Indian television soap opera , &quot; Ky@@ un@@ ki Sa@@ as B@@ hi Kab@@ hi Ba@@ hu Th@@ i , &quot; dubbed into Dar@@ i , was tele@@ cast on Tol@@ o T.@@ V .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s soft power . and that is what India is developing through the &quot; E &quot; part of TED : its own entertainment industry .
in the early &apos; 80s , I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti , infiltr@@ ating the secret societies which were the foundation of Du@@ vali@@ er &apos;s strength and Ton@@ ton Mac@@ out@@ es , and securing the poison used to make zombies .
I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut .
this is ay@@ ahu@@ asca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psycho@@ active preparation of the shaman &apos;s repertoire .
in fact , I used to argue with my professor , Richard Evan Sh@@ ul@@ tes -- who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930s -- I used to argue that you couldn &apos;t classify these tryp@@ ta@@ mines as halluc@@ ino@@ genic because by the time you &apos;re under the effects there &apos;s no one home anymore to experience a hallucination . ( Laughter ) But the thing about tryp@@ ta@@ mines is they cannot be taken orally because they &apos;re den@@ at@@ ured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase .
Thank you very much .
and this kind of relationship between designer and scientist started when I was at school .
so the principle of this object is to create an ecosystem called aqu@@ ap@@ onics .
now , in the Ash@@ an@@ in@@ ka tradition and culture , the pa@@ je is the most important person in the community .

when they encounter shock from the outside that they don &apos;t just unravel and fall to pieces .
my response is a sandstone wall made from bacteria and solidi@@ fied sand , stretching across the desert .
it &apos;s nothing like a tsunami or a Katrina : too few crying children and smashed up houses .
if people live inside of the green barrier they can help support the trees , protect them from humans , and from some of the forces of nature .
and , after an initial cost of 60 bucks to buy the bacteria , which you &apos;ll never have to pay again , one cubic meter of bacterial sand would be about 11 dollars .
I don &apos;t think you understand .
( Laughter ) When I was offered the Times column six years ago , the deal was like this : you &apos;ll be sent the coolest , hottest , sli@@ ck@@ est new gadgets .
another one , a guy called -- this is absolutely true -- his computer had crashed , and he told the technician he couldn &apos;t restart it , no matter how many times he typed &quot; 11 . &quot;
Microsoft &apos;s approach to simplicity tends to be : let &apos;s break it down ; let &apos;s just make it more steps .
and he &apos;s going around , &quot; How does it feel to be free ? &quot;
you have time to -- ( Laughter ) you have time to alert one house .
you can &apos;t deal with the security problem in the way that you need to .
we &apos;re saying that you cannot solve the problem of climate change in one country ; you &apos;ve got to involve all countries .
it can &apos;t really make the difference that ought to be made in a period of crisis .
and there are certainly many people in the audience who will be cheering you on as you seek to advance this global ethic .
and second , it gives us the opportunity to understand how these supermassive black holes interact with their environment , and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution of the galaxies which they reside in .
so , I wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is , as if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole .
and this beautiful picture taken with the Hubble Space Telescope shows you that galaxies come in all shapes and sizes .
to give you a sense of how small that size is , that &apos;s the size of our solar system .
( Applause )

here is a couple more . here is a physic@@ s-based puzzle .
our first game is called &quot; Pho@@ to Gra@@ b . &quot; the game takes about a minute and 20 seconds .
so nice , all week . he &apos;s the kind of man you could say to , &quot; Chris , I &apos;m really sorry , I &apos;ve crashed your car .
luckily , somebody like George Bush was really helpful .
Thank you very much indeed .
it &apos;s really exciting because , for the first time in the modern era , there will be enough Africans on the Earth to bully everybody else .
and so what would normally take him maybe a day or something to sol@@ der by hand , he can do in a few minutes using this machine .
and Kenya has a population of about 44 million people .
and the result is that some of them are going to be able to get loans to buy the machine for themselves .
so the productivity of a large swa@@ the of our population should be able to jump by a quantum amount , quite significantly , because of this kind of machine .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re at the beginning of , so this is really very exciting .
why don &apos;t we just use vending machines ?
she was 80 , almost that day of the interview , and there she was and there I was , and I just proceeded into the questions .
most people think that I was an actress . I was never an actress . &quot;
was yours unhappy ? &quot;
but she was thrilled to get that out as a real , real fact in her life .
we fixed the pricing , taking into account what they would save in bus fare in coming to a city , so they pay about 20 rupees , and that &apos;s good for three consul@@ tations .
( Applause ) So the final part of the puzzle is , how do you make all this work financially , especially when the people can &apos;t pay for it ?
there was a time when we failed to negotiate the &#91; intra@@ -@@ o@@ cular lens &#93; prices to be at affordable levels , so we set up a manufacturing unit .
I think inside at some point , we put our heads down on the pillow and we go , &quot; There &apos;s got to be more to life than this . &quot;
your parents may not have planned you , but I believe God did .
in those days , nobody had bank accounts , or American Ex@@ press cards , or hedge funds .
she was my childhood friend .
a mix of legal and illegal activities is used .
the same thing happened , of course , in the world of crime and terror .
and that &apos;s the power of storytelling .
well , that got us a little angry , so we changed it to F@@ igh@@ tin &apos; Splashy .
little larvae hatch out in fresh water .
and it occurs everywhere -- you know , why bother ?
but I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
so , are these things , how are these things getting here ?

my experiences over the last 18 months , as a lawyer , has seeded in me a new entrepreneurial idea , which I believe is indeed worth spreading .
the service which grew out of this , D@@ ial 12@@ 98 for Am@@ bu@@ lance , with one ambulance in 2004 , now has a hundred-@@ plus ambu@@ lan@@ ces in three states , and has transported over 100,000 patients and victims since inception .
corruption , bribes , and lack of transparency .
but you also don &apos;t have the time , resources , expertise or where@@ with@@ al to fight this .
yet the market forces around the world have not yet thrown up a service where you can call in , pay a fee , and fight the demand for a bribe .
yet I believe the price we pay is well worth holding on to our dignity and making the world a fairer place .
and as a child you &apos;re always worried about resource .
solar can do it , and we certainly have to develop solar .
and you can get energy out this way .
we have to get to this .
Shal@@ om . sat Sri Ak@@ al .
my name is Ab@@ du@@ l Khan . I come from P@@ es@@ ha@@ war .

you can see around 2001 it finally out-@@ sold the V@@ CR .

we could land anytime and fly back home with an airplane .
that &apos;s for sure .
a little bit like on this picture here .
and that is , there is a sudden emergence and rapid spread of a number of skills that are unique to human beings like tool use , the use of fire , the use of shelters , and , of course , language , and the ability to read somebody else &apos;s mind and interpret that person &apos;s behavior .
so , you have a patient with a phantom limb . if the arm has been removed and you have a phantom , and you watch somebody else being touched , you feel it in your phantom .
but this time I had to use a real body .
not that that is particularly beautiful when you look at it with the human eye , the way the leaves form . they &apos;re cur@@ ling back on each other .
the longer the exposure goes on for , the more detail you get .
how about these hormones or res@@ ver@@ atrol ?
that &apos;s why a 6@@ 5-year-old person is aging at a rate of about 125 times faster than a 12-year-old person .

it &apos;s simply a little saying these people say before their meal to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is &#91; 80 &#93; percent full .
fifteen years ago , the average American had three good friends .
it really changed my life totally .
this is the home of the gharial , this incredible crocodile .

so all of that said , is it , I guess , is it possible ?
and we went in , pretending to be buyers .
even in the times of H1N1 , I like the word .
and that directly increased student well@@ being .
and once that happened , they were out in the city convincing everybody that child labor just had to be aboli@@ shed .
right from loneliness to filling potholes in the street to alcoholism , and 32 children who stopped 16 child marriages in Rajasthan .
it was incredible .
&quot; listen , I &apos;m going back to the swamp mer@@ maid . can you call me in a little while ? &quot;
( Laughter ) Is that G@@ any@@ me@@ de Andr@@ om@@ eda Bur@@ ba ?
what &apos;s important about this is these shapes are du@@ als of each other .
( Laughter ) Man . I don &apos;t really need to comment on this .
you can see , even if you don &apos;t go for the numbers , the beauty of the symmetry .
I never told anybody . this is the first thing . this could be history .
I love fashion .
and it began with an entire year of research .
clothing equals confidence .
it &apos;s 1996 in U@@ vir@@ a in eastern Congo .
so I wonder , billions of us now have this powerful tool right at our fingertips .
and the prote@@ ster is a live-@@ streaming activist -- he wears a little camera -- and he says to the military policeman , he says , &quot; I am watching you , and there are 5,000 people watching you with me . &quot;
clearly we don &apos;t have 10 planets .
and there &apos;s more and more people on the way . right ?
another thing that information technology lets us do is start figuring out how to use less stuff by knowing , and by monitoring , the amount we &apos;re actually using .
but , you know , there may even be a simpler approach .
another world is possible .
and as they grow up , they will grow up around the mines , their roots will detect the chemicals in them , and where the flowers turn red you don &apos;t step .
( Laughter ) I told her that I wanted to up the ante and hold my breath longer than any human being ever had .
the first is B@@ har@@ ti K@@ her .
in this particular work , she actually strips out the images and leaves the actual text to reveal something previously unseen , and provocative .
the strategy here , is if a patient comes in to us with a diseased or injured organ , you can take a very small piece of tissue from that organ , less than half the size of a postage stamp , you can then tease that tissue apart , and look at its basic components , the patient &apos;s own cells , you take those cells out , grow and expand those cells outside the body in large quantities , and then we then use scaffold materials .
for the second phase of the trials we just had different sizes , small , medium , large and extra-@@ large .
we then take this vascular structure and we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply .
I started asking my questions , &quot; Well , why me ? &quot;
and you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places .
and where do you expose yourselves to risks that maybe perhaps you don &apos;t even see ? &quot;
anybody ? boy you &apos;re lucky .
that was what he was talking about on that quote .
so they &apos;re deprived of understanding their reality .
and we architects are co@@ wards .
now , the first issue that we faced was that the Dallas Theater Center had a notori@@ ety that was beyond what you would expect of some place outside of the tri@@ um@@ vir@@ ate of New York , Chicago and Seattle .
one of the things that we learned when we visited various theaters is they hate us architects , because they say the first thing they have to do , the first five minutes of any show , is they have to get our architecture out of the mind of their patron .
well now there are potentials of this building to allow the artistic director to actually move into the building without using our architecture .
you &apos;d be able to open portions in order to change the procession , allow people to come in and out for an inter@@ mission , or to enter for the beginning or the end of a performance .
when I spent my first weeks at P@@ anzi hospital I sat with women who sat and lined up every day to tell me their stories .
my mind was so shattered .
if we teach girls to change the verb we will actually enforce the girl inside us and the girl inside them .
I know a 14-year-old girl in the Netherlands , for example , who is demanding that she take a boat and go around the entire world by herself .
she imagined her father killing her on one hand , and Mama Agnes greeting her , with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house .
and I give you my word , here and now , that we will not cut your sisters either . &quot;
looks simple , but we &apos;ve re@@ iter@@ ated this dozens of times by going into the field to talk to doctors , moms and clinicians to ensure that this really meets the needs of the local communities .
and you say then , &quot; OK , then how do you know your home address ? &quot;
so , I hope I can really accomplish that .
I think there is something very profoundly right in what these women are doing .
just doesn &apos;t make sense .
the car swer@@ ves to avoid it , and therefore doesn &apos;t get into an accident .
but it &apos;s just a story . and I want to go beyond the story , and go to something more .
his name is Mike , and he is uni@@ form@@ ly impaired on cognition , vision , walking , sensation .
I &apos;m taking three drugs to manage it . some of them are experimental .
and they call the Internet irresponsible .
because I don &apos;t want to wait for the next trial , it &apos;s going to be years .
but you know , a lot of people dropped out , the trial , there is too much drop out .
so , remember I told you about my brother &apos;s stem cell transplant .
in a moment , I &apos;m going to ask if you would close your eyes and see if you can work out what emotions you &apos;re feeling right now .
you &apos;ve probably heard the theory that our entire emotional lives can be boiled down to a handful of basic emotions .
feel sad today , and you might feel impatient , even a little ashamed .
SS : he talks to other Bon@@ obos at the lab , long-distance , farther than we can hear .
the next symbol Panbanisha writes represents &quot; collar . &quot;
the problem I want to talk with you about is really the problem of : how does one supply health care in a world in which cost is everything ?
and the procedure that we have is simply to start with paper .
a friend of mine works in tran@@ scul@@ tural psychiatry , and he is interested in the question of why people do and don &apos;t take their meds .
here is another example of something which is -- this is a little spectro@@ phot@@ ometer .
the neat thing about this is , you have a light source that fli@@ ckers on and off at about 1,000 hertz , another light source that detects that light at 1,000 hertz , and so you can run this system in broad daylight .
you change that system , and you could have a marked effect on the cancer .
I mean , this is a scary slide , not to take an aside , but it looks at obesity in the world .
and I &apos;m sorry if you can &apos;t read the numbers , they &apos;re kind of small .
would you want your mother , your brother , your sister to get a placebo if they had advanced lung cancer and had weeks to live ?
and so I went about and made that sculpture , turning it out of solid bronze .
and then I left gaps so you could see the one that was done before .
I mean , I &apos;ve got the symptoms .
and we are expressions of the universe , basically .
JH : well , I love the idea that somewhere within this idea of fine motion and control with the traditional skills that you have with your hand , some sort of more elemental force gets revealed , and that &apos;s the beauty here .
we had this small NGO , Tran@@ spar@@ ency International .
it costs way less than obesity now .
he has to bury the people , OK ?
let &apos;s be frank and honest .
( video ) Jamie Oliver : let &apos;s have a talk .
they &apos;re doing their best .
you know , there &apos;s your week .
definitely they shouldn &apos;t be left out .
( audience ) Yeah !
we &apos;re inside the Pi@@ ke Place Market .
I &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
it &apos;s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and so overall , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even , perhaps , a factor of six .
is it a Manhattan Project ? what &apos;s the thing that can get us there ?
well , we need lots of companies working on this -- hundreds .
that &apos;s good .
CA : in terms of big-@@ scale possible game chan@@ gers , is this the biggest that you &apos;re aware of out there ?
and if you marry this fact with the incredible abundance of information that we have in our world today , I think you can completely , as I &apos;ve said , remake politics , remake government , remake your public services .
and the third of these big changes : accountability .
we &apos;re being advised by some of these people , as was said , to try and bring all the experience to book .
and I &apos;m going to suggest that this is a good thing .
by not treating the wholeness of a person , by not acknowledging their potency , we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have .
and I turn around , and it &apos;s this older man . I have no idea who he is .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper cli@@ pp@@ ings throughout my whole childhood , whether winning a second grade spelling bee , marching with the Girl S@@ cou@@ ts , you know , the Halloween parade , winning my college scholarship , or any of my sports victories , and he was using it , and integrating it into teaching resident students , med students from Ha@@ h@@ ne@@ mann Medical School and Her@@ sh@@ ey Medical School .
now , the other type of mantis shrimp is the sma@@ sh@@ er stomat@@ opod , and these guys open up snails for a living .
so , the sma@@ sh@@ er rap@@ torial appendage can stab with a point at the end , or it can smash with the heel .
and so I thought that this was sort of the end of the story .
how much learning can you do ?
the same thing happens with , say , a hammer , which is general at first and becomes more specific .
nuclear energy , fission , is a really bad idea for bombs .
so , maybe spraying DDT on crops is a really bad idea .
we &apos;ve been trained to think that the way to look at every dispute , every issue , is a matter of kind of individual rights .
this is Air@@ Strip Techno@@ logies .
OK , now , if you want to understand autism : animals .
they flash up into my memory , just like Google for pictures .
and I came in half an hour beforehand so I could have it put on and kind of get used to it , and they got it bent so it &apos;s not hitting my chin .
now , visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight into the animal mind .
man on a horse , and a man on the ground -- that is viewed as two totally different things .
you have another horse , where maybe the horse@@ sho@@ er beat him up , and he &apos;ll be terrible for anything on the ground with the veterinarian , but a person can ride him .
like if the kid loves race cars , let &apos;s use race cars for math .
they can do graphic design , all kinds of stuff with computers , photography , industrial design .
the pattern thinkers -- they &apos;re the ones that are going to be your mathematicians , your software engineers , your computer programmers , all of those kinds of jobs .
( Laughter ) Temple Grand@@ in : because who do you think made the first stone spear ?
but if there is someone here who has an autistic child , or knows an autistic child and feels kind of cut off from them , what advice would you give them ?
and server farms , or data centers , are great libraries of knowledge .
so that &apos;s the personal reason .
so , from the perspective of engineering , we can ask : Go@@ ven that we know that motion is so important for the human visual system , can we use this as a recipe for constructing machine-@@ based vision systems that can learn on their own , that don &apos;t need to be programmed by a human programmer ?
so we are creating Dylan , which is a computational system with an ambitious goal of taking in visual inputs of the same kind that a human child would receive , and autonomously discovering : what are the objects in this visual input ?
forget it , they will confuse you even if you know how to draw .
and then I was fortunate enough to actually perform this in California with Vel@@ o@@ city Cir@@ cus .
that &apos;s us in New York .
my works also turned autobiographical .
and those are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both lu@@ mped in the notion of happiness .
and here is a surprise .
most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self .
and how to spend it would seem to be relevant , but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us .
that &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remembering self .
now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half .
but one thing will happen : they will think they are happier , because , when they think about it , they &apos;ll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio , and they will feel they made the right decision .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life evaluation , so we need to have that debate fairly soon .
Ken K@@ now@@ l@@ ton does wonderful composite images , like creating Jacques Cousteau out of se@@ ash@@ ells -- un-@@ re@@ touched se@@ ash@@ ells , but just by rearranging them . he did Einstein out of dice because , after all , Einstein said , &quot; God does not play dice with the universe . &quot; BERT Her@@ zo@@ g out of un-@@ re@@ touched keyboards . will Sh@@ ort@@ z , crossword puzzle . John Ce@@ der@@ qui@@ st does these wonderful tr@@ om@@ pe l &apos;@@ o@@ e@@ il cabinets .
it &apos;s jumped 20 years into 20-@@ over game .
another half an hour and we would have won . &quot;
( Laughter ) The Maha@@ b@@ har@@ ata was like that as well , wasn &apos;t it ?
and suddenly we fell in love with the 50-@@ over game , and we played it virtually every day .
and so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me , Ravi D@@ h@@ ari@@ w@@ al from Pepsi , decided he &apos;s going to take it all over the world .
and then something very dramatic happened .
and so , they were ag@@ ha@@ st when the cheer@@ leaders arrived .
now , all of the sudden , if you were to bowl a shot -- if Mumbai were to bowl a shot , for example , they nee@@ dn &apos;t go to Kal@@ ba@@ dev@@ i or Shi@@ va@@ ji Park or somewhere to source them , they could go to Trinidad .
I &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re here because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends , right ?
( Applause ) Now , if I want to just kind of take a peek at these , I might think , &quot; Well , what about taking a look at all of cycling ? &quot;
and so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way -- going narrower , broader , backing in , backing out -- you &apos;re not searching , you &apos;re not browsing .
and , if I want to step back and look at everything , I can slice and dice my history , perhaps by my search history -- here , I was doing some ne@@ po@@ ti@@ stic searching , looking for B@@ ing , over here for Live Labs Pi@@ vot .
so , that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it .
so , that &apos;s the thought I would leave you with , is that in whatever you &apos;re doing , failure is an option , but fear is not . Thank you .
please be excited , have fun , yell , scream .
sometimes you would think that maybe kids would enjoy it , but sometimes they get a little freaked out .
so , it was always like , they called me Kid David , because I was the kid .
the problem isn &apos;t that we have mental models .
we invest in the outcome , and as I &apos;ve just pointed out , the outcome is frequently different from what we would like , and sometimes the dia@@ metric opposite of what we would like .
there is an alternative .
and if you start doing that , you will find that your life changes .
and it mer@@ ges the stop sign and yield signs .
but how would you specialize ?
and that night , I was lying in bed , and I thought : what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
he &apos;s an amazing guy , like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Cro@@ codi@@ le Dun@@ de@@ e .
( Laughter ) He shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; We farm extensively , not inten@@ sively .
so the pin@@ ker the belly , the better the system . &quot;
this is a view looking up the ice@@ fall , the first 2,000 feet of the climb up from base camp .
some of these things are 10 stories deep or more , and one of my climbing friends says that the reason we actually climb at night is because if we ever saw the bottom of what we &apos;re climbing over , we would never do it .
this is what I carried up the mountain .
I couldn &apos;t imagine anybody laying in the snow that long a time and then getting up .
you have the middle area , where the temporal lobe might be , in here , and the pos@@ terior portion , where the maintenance functions are in the back .
Thank you .
so , let me show them to you . that &apos;s one , two three , four , five .
( Applause ) ( Laughter ) Nor@@ m@@ ally now , I would take the needle out .
OK , so here is the sort of big idea : if you look out at nature , you find that as you tend to see suspended animation , you tend to see immortality .
so I wondered : might we be able to find some agent or trigger that might induce such a state in us ?
and this all happened really quickly because of a lot of help from a lot of people .
all right ? that &apos;s the first time .
&quot; hello ? uh , who ?
so , sensors are looking at that kind of voice .
I &apos;ve been wearing a little technology that we call S@@ him@@ mer .
I &apos;m a qualitative researcher , but when I look at these data streams coming in from these homes , I can look at the data and tell you the day that some doctor prescribed them something that nobody else knew that they were on , because we see the changes in their patterns in the household . right ?
it doesn &apos;t matter how we finance healthcare .
but there is no goal within this health reform .
I &apos;m Jane McG@@ on@@ ig@@ al . I &apos;m a game designer .
but actually , according to my research at the Institute for the Future , actually the opposite is true .
and I started to notice a few things that make epic wins so possible in online worlds .
and according to Her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they passed 18 years this way , surviving through a famine , by eating on one day , and playing games on the next .
Jim Ax@@ el@@ rod : forget the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty .
tourist : from our hearts , it affected us just as much .
Jim Ax@@ el@@ rod , CBS News , New York .
DR : it was not an inclusive group .
it was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it , where the families of the victims had left notes to them .
there was something about the comfort of the filter and how much information was between us and the experience .
and we also , frankly , knew that if it didn &apos;t happen by the end of the Gi@@ u@@ li@@ ani administration , then everyone who we were dealing with at the D@@ OT and the Police Department and all of the -- we were meeting with 20 or 30 people with the city at a time , and it was set up by the Office of Emer@@ gency Management .
so this developer said , &quot; You know what , we &apos;ll under@@ write the entire expense . &quot;
and I think this was the 21st , and we knew this had to be built and up by the 28@@ th .
and I think regardless of what the position is about how this sacred piece of land is to be used , having it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter , I think makes it a more powerful dialogue .
KA : well , I think that &apos;s interesting .
and why do we live in places where such dis@@ similar people collide up against us each day ?
and if you want to take a single crystal of DNA , it looks like that .
this is what you look like . this is one of your chromosomes .
and very soon it &apos;s going to matter if you &apos;re literate in life code .
and the third said , &quot; Let &apos;s find another director . &quot;
the gods sent the storm . &quot;
and an idea started to develop .
when you get up , the night and day is a contradiction .
but you get up at 4 a.m .
but I think this is quite clearly untrue .
Thank you very much .
but again , then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .
illegal wildlife trade in Brazil is one of the major threats against our fauna , especially birds , and mainly to supply the pet market with thousands of animals taken from nature every month , and transported far from their origins , to be sold mainly in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo .
however , this would mean having killed 26@@ ,@@ 2@@ 67 birds , only in the state of São Paulo , only in 2006 .
( Applause )
if you happened to be on Mars when this imp@@ actor hit , it was a really bad day on Mars .

Robert G@@ up@@ ta .
D : good to have you with us , Brent .
Mo : we &apos;re recommending to our clients a buy and hold strategy .
there &apos;s a lot of vulnerable people out there . it &apos;s very exciting .
they key here is that people have ceased to be that capital purchase item and become like Styrofoam cups .
and if there is anything that makes me feel very positive about this , it &apos;s that there are also -- in addition to young men like this who are still enslaved -- there are ex-@@ slaves who are now working to free others .
we do not buy people out of slavery .
liberation , and more importantly all the work that comes after liberation .
the children have taught them .
more than 90 percent of our non-@@ teaching staff are all parents and extended families .
( Applause )
and that &apos;s how you make a movement .
one large children &apos;s publisher ironically said that they didn &apos;t work with children .
but I &apos;m a scientist and I don &apos;t like to make data out of anecdotes , so let &apos;s look at some data .
( Applause ) Okay , seriously , HIV is actually not that easy to transmit sexually .
&quot; well , would it help if I ... &quot;
he finishes explaining that , and I &apos;m waiting for the big 300 pound paper proposal , and he said , &quot; That &apos;s what I want from you . &quot;
and it can &apos;t be done .
he sat at a table with seven or eight of these other guys .
so , you know H.@@ G. Wells &apos;s &quot; War of the Worl@@ ds , &quot; novel and movie .
where do we get this spark of imagination ?
and there you go .
here is a scanning electron micro@@ graph of a grain of pollen .
so , that &apos;s 20 micr@@ ometers across , that pollen grain there .
&quot; so , what are pollen &apos;s properties ? &quot; I hear you ask .
that tells me that it &apos;s actually been fossilized , this pollen .
four very different habitats might look similar , but they &apos;ve got very different pollen signatures .
I hope I &apos;ve opened your eyes , if you &apos;ll excuse the visual pun , ( Laughter ) to some of pollen &apos;s secrets .
a college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little stri@@ dent .
why do we do that ?
no , but they had a major impact .
now , you can reduce the embodied energy by about 25 percent by using high fly ash concrete .
but before we pat ourselves too much on the back , we have poured 15@@ 1 mega@@ watt hours of energy into constructing this house when there was a house there before .
I had low self-esteem .
and of course , the store couldn &apos;t sustain itself , so I had to close it .
well , I decided I was going to chase Mr. Holmes out to the parking lot -- probably not the smartest decision that I made .
we went in , and two and a half hours later , we came out after hugging and crying and , very strangely , bonding over Chuck Nor@@ ris for some reason .
Thank you very much .
nowadays , in addressing microbial biodiversity , scientists are like explorers in a row@@ boat launched onto the Pacific Ocean .
today , the practic@@ alities of making such an encyclopedia , regardless of the magnitude of the information put into it , are within reach .
I went up to the front of the tank , and he &apos;s just staring at me , and he had little horns come up above his eyes .
the surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing .
Ah ! I know where I can shoot that .
and this is the tropics .
what do you really care about that isn &apos;t right where you live ?
so that &apos;s how I answer that question .
it &apos;s always what it was and what it can be .
it is really in this sense of discovery that I have a new set of questions that I &apos;m asking .
now , this exhibition , as I said , 40 young artists done over the course of eight years , and for me it &apos;s about considering the implications .
so you turn on the camera , turn out the lights .
in fact , most of the people studying bioluminescence today are focused on the chemistry , because these chemicals have proved so incredibly valuable for developing anti@@ bacterial agents , cancer fighting drugs , testing for the presence of life on Mars , detecting pollutants in our waters -- which is how we use it at O@@ R@@ CA .

it &apos;s not exactly rocket science . we call this thing E@@ ye@@ -in-@@ the-@@ Sea .
I could not have asked for a better proof of concept .
no , I don &apos;t do that ; I &apos;m a conju@@ rer , who is someone who pre@@ tends to be a real magician . ( Laughter ) Now , how do we go about that sort of thing ?
don &apos;t you ever forget that .
they claim to be psych@@ ics , or sensi@@ tives , whatever they can .

Sylvia Browne is an exception in that she &apos;s the only professional psychic in the whole world that has accepted our challenge .
we really must do something about this .
we also see that this region has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease .

the press is certainly a business , and in order to survive it must be a successful business , but the right balance must be found between marketing considerations and journalistic responsibility .
in 1994 , after three months of covering the South African election , I saw the inauguration of Nelson Mandela , and it was the most uplifting thing I &apos;ve ever seen .
land mine victims being helped at the Red Cross rehab center being run by Alberto Cairo .

( Laughter ) And you might think that , you know , that &apos;s easy , sand is not ice cold .
Thank you .
( cheers ) All right . here we go .
so your brain is constructing the image of a snake where there is no snake , and this kind of a hallucination is what neuroscientists like me call &quot; predictions . &quot;
predictions are the basis of every experience that you have .
and so how does your brain give you that detail ?
and for reasons equally unclear to me , seem to be in@@ ordin@@ ately proud of the three of us .

and you read further into the story , and it &apos;s saying , the horrifying thing that &apos;s going on is that the fisheries are so overfishing the wild fishes , that it is taking down the fish populations in the oceans by 38 percent .

governments seem to think that &apos;s OK .

it &apos;s a big deal , yes . let &apos;s clap for justice .
we know we &apos;re all crazy in some way .
that &apos;s 2013 , and that &apos;s progressively getting worse , or progressing .
they then explained to me that it was the collection that belonged to their dear friend M@@ ace@@ o who passed away a few months earlier .
for something to be appropriate , it has to be realistic , so unfortunately , you can &apos;t use a key as an eyeball .
but &quot; novel , &quot; the second thing , is that nobody had to have said it .
everybody was speaking their new ideas .
well , this has deep implications about the limits of science , about predictability and controll@@ ability of things like biological processes or economies , about intelligence in the universe , about questions like free will and about creating technology .
two big things happened : first , a bunch of new ideas about linguistics that came from studying the computational universe ; and second , the realization that having actual compu@@ table knowledge completely changes how one can set about understanding language .
I think it &apos;s actually rather wonderful .
this is just an example of one of these compu@@ table documents .
actually , I haven &apos;t shown these before , but here are a few of the candidate universes that I &apos;ve looked at .
and to see all the people coming out to greet me and standing along the cliff tops and clapping and cheering , I just felt like a movie star .
so this might be a good moment to take a quick time-@@ out to answer a few F@@ A@@ Q@@ s about ocean rowing that might be going through your mind .
they were running out of food ; I was running out of water .
and I try to use this to bring awareness to these environmental issues , to bring a human face to the ocean .
so , what is simplicity ?
now wall switches , we all know , fail .
so there has to be function , the function has to be predictable and the cost has to be low .
and you put a drop , in this case , of urine at the bottom .
so , let me close -- ( Applause ) Let me close with my two aphor@@ isms .
could you create the ultimate TEDTalk ?
and analysis shows if you want to be among the most favorite TED speakers , you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average , make sure you wear your glasses and be slightly more dre@@ s@@ se@@ d-up than the average TED speaker .
and I hope some of you will be inspired for next year to create this , which I really want to see .
and now we can see what happens .
but what politicians need is a range of options .
so this evidence is powerful .
it &apos;s a slow , deliber@@ ative process of discovery .
Thank you very much .
so that when it gets dark , I &apos;ve got plenty of power .
and I can light up the N@@ ut@@ me@@ g like a beacon .

( Applause ) Look at what Ro@@ ja@@ de@@ en has done .
please understand the problem of poor people .
now , it is possible that I use only two buttons on the cellphone , only three options on the cellphone .
but if I had to get a match to match , obviously , I would need a different design of a cellphone .
but the idea has a merit . the idea has a merit .
a very powerful message Ap@@ pac@@ han : I watch the world wake up every day .
Mr. K@@ har@@ ai who is a physically challenged person , one and a half foot height , only .
we were talking about , my friends in Brazil , how we scale up this model in China and Brazil .
and we have a very vibrant network in China , particularly , but also emerging in Brazil and other parts of the world .
so my first topic with respect to this , was not death , but obesity .
so we did some mathematics to study the size of these clusters .
here , what &apos;s spreading from person to person is not a behavior , but rather a norm : an idea is spreading .
and so , I came to see these kinds of social networks as living things , as living things that we could put under a kind of microscope to study and analyze and understand .
so the friend of a friend of A &apos;s is , back again , a friend of A &apos;s , whereas the friend of a friend of B &apos;s is not a friend of B &apos;s , but is farther away in the network .
they are a kind of social capital .
we invent for fun -- invention is a lot of fun to do -- and we also invent for profit .
you can distribute bed nets , and bed nets are very effective if you use them .
now , malaria is an incredibly complicated disease .
and , in a moment , we &apos;re going to see a view of the air@@ flow .
first , before I get started , let me be perfectly clear about one thing : my fight is not against the casual adult use of marijuana -- I don &apos;t care about that .
with that kind of manipulation , the products that are being sold today can contain above 30 percent THC .
and our concentr@@ ates -- our concentr@@ ates can actually contain above 95 percent THC -- a far cry from the natural plant .
members of this community are more than twice as likely to consume THC than those who identify as heterosexual or cis@@ gender .
they also , unfortunately , have higher rates of mental illness and suicide .
so these organisms reproduce , the little larvae juveniles spill over , they all spill over , and then people can benefit from them outside too .
so the fishermen are catching more .
two examples , again , of how these reserves can benefit people .
if you fish less , you &apos;re actually catching more .
if it &apos;s so clear that these savings accounts are good for the environment and for people , why don &apos;t we have 20 , 50 percent of the ocean ?
first , we need to develop a global awareness campaign to inspire local communities and governments to create no-@@ take reserves that are better than what we have now .
but we have started studying pristine reefs only very recently .
the math serves the conversation , the conversation doesn &apos;t serve the math .
and I go , &quot; Oh , it &apos;s the same . it &apos;s basically the same . &quot;
so I go , &quot; You know , why don &apos;t we go on the Internet , and maybe we can see ... like on Wikipedia . &quot; ( Laughter ) So we go online , and we put in &quot; cats mating . &quot;
singing down the line .
audience : Whoa oh oh .
audience : Whoa oh .
thanks so much . Thank you guys .
who are they , and how many are they ?
nevertheless , much more needs to be done to complement these relatively isolated initiatives .
caring for someone should be a choice and should be done without putting one &apos;s own well-being in the balance .
end to end , that would form a line that would circle the earth twice .
it does this through an elaborate and elegant system of checks and balances , stimul@@ ators and inhibit@@ ors of angiogenesis , such that , when we need a brief burst of blood vessels , the body can do this by releasing stimul@@ ators , proteins called angiogenic factors , that act as natural fertilizer , and stimulate new blood vessels to sprout .
so here is a nine year-old box@@ er named Milo , who had a very aggressive tumor called a malignant neuro@@ fibr@@ oma growing on his shoulder .
but the real question is : how well do these work in practice ?
now , I &apos;ve shown you a bunch of lab data , and so the real question is : what is the evidence in people that eating certain foods can reduce angiogenesis in cancer ?
and like a tumor , fat grows when blood vessels grow .
( Laughter ) Now , I had heard this phrase , &quot; age of reason , &quot; before .
I ran up to him and said , &quot; Bill !
all but one guy , this guy named Mor@@ mon , who managed to survive by hiding in the woods .
and I said , &quot; Oh , dear .
and beef production uses 100 times the water that most vegetables do .
and then what we can do now is we can do instant comparisons of things in their homes .
but the population is declining and it &apos;s declined fairly substantially , about 21 percent since 1987 , when I started these surveys , in terms of number of active nests .
and so we have this penguin project . the Wildlife Conservation Society has funded me along with a lot of individuals over the last 27 years to be able to produce these kinds of maps .
then I realize that they &apos;re playing king of the box .
OK .
come talk to me about it , I &apos;ll fill in some of the details if you want .
we &apos;re here today to announce the first synthetic cell , a cell made by starting with the digital code in the computer , building the chromosome from four bottles of chemicals , assembling that chromosome in yeast , trans@@ planting it into a recipient bacterial cell and transforming that cell into a new bacterial species .
so once we realized that we could make 5@@ ,000-@@ base pair vir@@ al-@@ sized pieces , we thought , we at least have the means then to try and make seri@@ ally lots of these pieces to be able to eventually assemble them together to make this me@@ ga base chromosome .
so our team developed new techniques for actually growing , cloning entire bacterial chromosomes in yeast .
it &apos;s significant to us .
( Laughter ) He said this in December 18@@ 62 to the second annual meeting of Congress .
now that &apos;s a great deal of us , isn &apos;t it ?
and so for us , if you want to know the time , you have to wear something to tell it .
we have to move to a model that is based more on principles of agriculture .
and then everybody else would have to license this cu@@ ff or this sleeve because Joe B@@ low owns it .
it &apos;s really hard to get copyright for databases .
but you want an interdisciplinary team of people ha@@ shing this out , trying to figure out : what is the kind of ownership model , in a digital world , that &apos;s going to lead to the most innovation ?
step four : the older members of the Taliban , the fighters , start talking to the younger boys about the gl@@ ories of marty@@ r@@ dom .
they &apos;re ready to go out and fight because they &apos;ve been told that this is effectively their only way to glori@@ fy Islam .
this boy is called S@@ adi@@ k .
as one Taliban recru@@ iter told me , &quot; There will always be sacrif@@ icial lam@@ bs in this war . &quot;
it &apos;s like , as many times as the virus changes its clothes , it &apos;s still wearing the same socks , and now our job is to make sure we get the body to really hate those socks .
SB : I think flu is different . I think what happened with flu is we &apos;ve got a bunch -- I just showed some of this -- a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now .
( Laughter ) Tech joy , to me , means something , because I get a lot of joy out of tech .
and eventually , it just makes them stop playing with it , or they draw penises and things like that .
I mean this is incredible .
so here &apos;s exhibit number one .
so here he is beginning .
hugely successful .
and it explains the vast right-wing conspiracy that &apos;s obviously developed around these licenses , as now more than 350 million digital objects are out there , licensed freely in this way .
I tripped on the reality of this ecology of creativity just last week .
not a single example of reform has been produced yet .
then , on the side , we &apos;ve got the Web and , increasingly , the cloud , which is fantastic , but also -- in the regard in which an interface is fundamental -- kind of a distraction .
the beam spl@@ it@@ ters and lenses are represented by physical objects , and the system projects down the laser beam path .
so this led full circle , in a strange way , to build these ideas into what we believe is the necessary future of human machine interface : the S@@ pati@@ al Oper@@ ating Environment , we call it .
so I &apos;m going to leave that over there because I have a question for Paul .
but , you know , here we see a shark that &apos;s maybe 10 or 11 inches long swimming in about a foot of water .
they matched , they found his My@@ Space .
Thank you .
now , I &apos;m not sure I would have necessarily recommended everyone at TED to go and check it out anyway .
and again , we had to fly to the Jo@@ vian system to get any sense that this moon , as most moons , was anything other than a dead ball of rock .
and the electrons can only be in particular places .
so , I think science can be -- serendipity is important .
it can also , I think , finally reveal the most profound ideas to us about our place in the universe and really the value of our home planet .

we need to think of HIV not as a single virus that we think we &apos;ve figured out , but as a collection of rapidly evolving and highly unique viruses , each of which can set off the next deadly epidemic .

I would love to have something in the fourth place here , but in terms of constant , clean , scalable energy , &#91; solar &#93; and wind and the other renewables aren &apos;t there yet because they &apos;re in@@ constant .
when you add all these things up -- Saul Gri@@ ff@@ ith did the numbers and figured out what would it take to get 13 clean tera@@ watts of energy from wind , solar and biofuels , and that area would be roughly the size of the United States , an area he refers to as &quot; R@@ ene@@ wi@@ stan . &quot;
for wind , there &apos;s a larger area , but much smaller footprint .
you can do that by combining renewables .
because five years from now , it will blow you away what we &apos;ll actually have as alternatives to this horrible , disastrous nuclear power .

in fact , what S@@ kin@@ ner discovered is that , if you put a pigeon in a box like this , and he has to press one of these two keys , and he tries to figure out what the pattern is , and you give him a little reward in the hop@@ per box there -- if you just randomly assign rewards such that there is no pattern , they will figure out any kind of pattern .
you &apos;ve been taken out of the gene pool .

I &apos;d like to tell you about one such child , whose story was also covered by ABC News .

I remember sitting at my desk being about the only person in the world who knew that whale meat being sold in these markets was really dolphin meat , and it was toxic .
and I remember there sitting at my desk thinking , &quot; Well , I know this . this is a great scientific discovery , &quot; but it was so awful .
it isn &apos;t just there that this happens , but in a natural diet of some communities in the Canadian arctic and in the United States and in the European arctic , a natural diet of seals and whales leads to an accumulation of PCBs that have gathered up from all parts of the world and ended up in these women .
they cannot feed their offspring , their children , their breast milk because of the accumulation of these toxins in their food chain , in their part of the world &apos;s ocean pyramid .
and people spend , depending on who they are , between 90 and 95 percent of their energy getting around on foot .
and every one of those industries , by the way -- just golf carts alone is a multi-@@ billion-dollar industry .

on a macro level , four billion people on Earth make less than four dollars a day .

and when you think about food , the underpinning of food in both cases is potentially problematic agriculture .
so I &apos;m hoping that by connecting really disparate organizations like the O@@ N@@ E campaign and Slow Food , which don &apos;t seem right now to have much in common , we can talk about holistic , long-term , systemic solutions that will improve food for everyone .
the piece of art you see on your left is painted by a western red ce@@ dar and that on your right by a Douglas fir , and what I learned was that different species have different signatures , like a Picasso versus a Monet .

let &apos;s start this new revolution at the tail end of the old one , with synthetic biology being the way to transform both our environment and our future .
and the reason is that when they tried to play on public servers , they kept running into bullies and trolls .

they were these kind of weird things .
there &apos;s this waiting hand from a human experimenter , and May@@ day quickly figures out , apparently the human wants this .
and then we gave them options that were bonuses -- like you guys did in the first scenario -- so they actually have a chance more , or pieces where they were experiencing losses -- they actually thought they were going to get more than they really got .
do the monkeys actually want to play it safe and then go with the guy who &apos;s going to do the same thing on every trial , or do they want to be risky and try to get a risky , but big , bonus , but risk the possibility of getting no bonus .
so they look like they &apos;re starting out with a big amount .
but now they learn these guys are going to give them less than they expect .
you know , maybe it &apos;s not just humans at the right side of this chain that &apos;s dun@@ cey .
well , the good news , I think , is what I started with at the beginning of the Talk , which is that humans are not only smart ; we &apos;re really inspi@@ rationally smart to the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom .

I remember standing on the edge of the ice , about to dive into the water , and thinking to myself , I have never ever seen any place on this earth which is just so frightening .

you can take the most fascinating organisms in the world , like a microbe that literally breathes uranium , and another one that makes rocket fuel , mix them up with some ocean mud , put them underneath a microscope , and they &apos;re just little dots .

so you can see clearly , at a glance , that things like us and Gi@@ ar@@ dia and bun@@ nies and pine trees are all , like , siblings , and then the bacteria are like our ancient cousins .
they don &apos;t care about the Sun , and they don &apos;t care about growing fast , and they probably don &apos;t give a damn about my petri dishes ...

we turned the money over to that man there , the principal of the school .
it is rare to get an ex@@ o@@ genous investment in girls &apos; education .

it &apos;s incredibly powerful , and it has this dynamic where you have to return at a certain time to water your fake crops , or they wil@@ t .
they will return , like clock@@ work , at different times .
and the good news is there might be an easy solution to that , and that &apos;s using our eyes more .
these little green peaks are asteroid collisions .
but if you start working with it and playing with it in a certain way , interesting things can appear and different patterns can be revealed .
( audience : sick leave . ) DM : sick leave . yeah , you &apos;ll definitely want to take some time off .

and harnessing the power of millions of small@@ holder farmers and their badass cows like mine , we should be able to bring a halt to stunting in Africa .
with the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools that are available now to every consumer , it &apos;s impossible to control where it goes .

and we created , at the organization that I work for , the New Econ@@ omics Foundation , something we call the Happy Planet Index , because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy .
they &apos;re Latin American .
that &apos;s what we need to do .
what would that look like for society ?
at a personal level , we need these nudges too .
based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness , cognitive behavioral therapy , &#91; very &#93; strong for our well being .
we don &apos;t trans@@ gress the climate boundary until the early &apos; 90s , actually , right after Rio .
but it changes fundamentally our governance and management paradigm , from the current linear , command and control thinking , looking at efficiencies and optimization towards a much more flexible , a much more adaptive approach , where we recognize that redundancy , both in social and environmental systems , is key to be able to deal with a turbulent era of global change .
and so , what I think it comes down to is a question of , not only having information of what &apos;s going on , but paying attention to that and letting that shift our motivation to become more sincere and genuinely positive .
in his presence , I had always felt seen .
I told him I loved him , said goodbye and headed off for my day .

God knows , if we ever needed that capacity in human history , we need it now .
so I &apos;m going to demonstrate that through discussion of some of the climate change things that are going on in the ocean .
what caused it ?
so they &apos;re either just truly monster El Nin@@ os , or they &apos;re just very strong El Nin@@ os that occurred against a backdrop of global warming .
we can analyze the carbonate that makes up the coral , and there &apos;s a whole bunch of things we can do .
but then at the very end is where we have the instrumental record in black .
you know , these are things that we have good physiological reasons to expect to see stressed caused by this transi@@ ence .
best dancer walks tall , gets the best date .
there &apos;s millions connected .
okay , step back a minute .
but look at this video .
and it &apos;s incredible to watch , but there &apos;s nothing psychic or paranormal going on ; it &apos;s simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond , usually , with what &apos;s going on around it .
and my colleague , James F@@ ow@@ ler and I have been studying for quite sometime what are the mathematical , social , biological and psychological rules that govern how these networks are assembled and what are the similar rules that govern how they operate , how they affect our lives .
or , frankly , for advertising with all kinds of products .
and with this science , we can understand how exactly the whole comes to be greater than the sum of its parts .
the first string is the drone string , which plays a continuous sound like the bag@@ pipe .
we have the &quot; flash &quot; of insight , the &quot; stroke &quot; of insight , we have &quot; epi@@ phan@@ ies , &quot; we have eureka moments , we have the &quot; light bulb &quot; moments , right ?
so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues , and everybody &apos;s like , &quot; No , I hadn &apos;t thought of doing that .
when you build them right , they will be led to completely new directions the creators never even dreamed of .
and so when we look at these P@@ MT@@ CT programs , what does it mean ?
and 46@@ 6@@ 64 is the number that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Rob@@ ben Island .
I became a member of Treat@@ ment Action Campaign and I &apos;m very proud to be a member of that incredible organization .
what about our other dark-@@ skinned daughters in distress whose deaths we have yet to remember ?
but I do not want to be a mother who gave birth to poems .
recently , T@@ oni Mor@@ rison wrote , &quot; In times of dread , artists must never choose to remain silent .
&quot; in times of dread , artists must never choose to remain silent .
I &apos;ll give you three quick tips to protect your ears and pass these on to your children , please .
professional hearing protec@@ tors are great ; I use some all the time .
sound design is the future , and I think it &apos;s the way we &apos;re going to change the way the world sounds .
this tracks your activity and also your sleep .
( cheering ) Sebastian Se@@ ung : what am I ?
I could just go home now .
so we start at the top , and we color in the cross-section of one branch in red , and we do that for the next slice and for the next slice .
a cool and refreshing stream of water , you say .
&quot; because you have felt me , I can feel myself again . &quot;
if we want the public to believe that design is for them and for everyone .
she said , &quot; Dear Johnny , I thought the other day , as I sat in my doctor &apos;s office , how depressing it was , from the color on the wall , to the carpet on the floor .
a recent study -- this almost floors me -- a recent study showing how major life traumas affect people suggests that if it happened over three months ago , with only a few exceptions , it has no impact whatsoever on your happiness .
of course , six months later , Ray K@@ ro@@ c had exactly the same idea .
let me first show you an experimental paradigm that &apos;s used to demonstrate the synthesis of happiness among regular old folks .
now we give you a choice : &quot; we happen to have some extra prints in the closet .
now , here &apos;s the experiment we did , and I hope this is going to convince you that &quot; Yeah , right ! &quot; was not the right response .
I &apos;ll take number three . &quot;
but if I do this with amne@@ si@@ ac patients , they don &apos;t have a clue .
we created a black-and-white photography course , and we allowed students to come in and learn how to use a dark@@ room .
the B@@ ard said everything best , of course , and he &apos;s making my point here but he &apos;s making it hyperbo@@ lically : &quot; &apos; T@@ is nothing good or bad But thinking makes it so . &quot;
that was wonderful , but it covered only 20 percent of the country .
like , &quot; Mother takes the pill every night .
and after 35 / 36 years , it &apos;s still going on .
( Laughter ) And what happened ?
these are primary school kids -- third , fourth grade -- going to every household in the village , every household in the whole of Thailand , giving AIDS information and a condom to every household , given by these young kids .
and we believe if you want to help the poor , those who are living in poverty , access to credit must be a human right .
so we have now found the weapon of mass protection .
this recycling system has been in place for the last billion years .
and I want you to really watch closely these little white dots on the screen , because , over the five-@@ day period , what they do is extend out and through this material , using the energy that &apos;s contained in these seed hus@@ ks to build this ch@@ it@@ inous polymer matrix .
so it looks a little bit like this .
they want to spend less and save more .
well psychology actually says there is a tension -- a tension between self-@@ regarding behaviors and other regarding behaviors .
what does all this mean for economics ?
it has to be investing in low-carbon technologies and infrastructures .
and for the first time , we &apos;re able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean using light and photons to measure sunrise and sunset .
that satellite tag will now have your shark phone home and send in a message .
they get returned , and when they get returned , here on a NASA numerical ocean you can see bluefin in blue go across their corridor , returning to the Western Pacific .
we can save the white shark .
now this sounds a little theoretical , but it &apos;s not so theoretical .
the Nile Delta was a misery for children with diarrheal disease and malaria and a lot of problems .
and this problem is : where are the plants ?
no one can say that the plants were able to eat an animal , because it was against the order of nature .
now with the pollination , it &apos;s a very serious issue for plants , because they move the pollen from one flower to the other , yet they cannot move from one flower to the other .
this is not a metaphor .
let &apos;s imagine that we can build robots and robots that are inspired by plants .
but why have we not any plan@@ to@@ id ?
well , if we &apos;re going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of Millennium Development Goals that we &apos;re set as a world , we need to learn from the innovators , and those innovators come from every single sector .
women are refusing to marry men without toilets .
working with M@@ IN@@ US@@ T@@ A@@ H , which is the U.N. mission in Haiti , with the Ministry of Public Works , with different NGOs , we inspected over 1,500 buildings .
it &apos;s so queer that physicists resort to one or another paradoxical interpretation of it .
and his friend replied , &quot; Well , obviously , because it just looks as though the Sun is going round the Earth . &quot;
as an evolutionary biologist , I &apos;d say this : our brains have evolved to help us survive within the orders of magnitude , of size and speed which our bodies operate at .
then , General Stu@@ bble@@ b@@ ine ban@@ ged his nose hard on the wall of his office .
waves of electromagnetic fluctuation in a vacuum seem un@@ real .
in a desert plain in Tanzania , in the shadow of the volcano O@@ l Do@@ in@@ yo Len@@ ga@@ i , there &apos;s a dune made of volcanic ash .
Steve Grand points out that you and I are , ourselves , more like a wave than a permanent thing .
I want to end by applying the idea of Middle World to our perceptions of each other .
and you can let them social network with your tadpole , because the Environmental Health Clinic has a social networking site for , not only impati@@ ents , humans , but non-@@ humans , social networking for humans and non-@@ humans .
and that aggre@@ gating effect , that collective action effect , is actually something we can use to our advantage .
and aggregated , these smaller intercep@@ tions could actually infiltrate all the road@@ borne pollution that now runs into the e@@ stu@@ ary system , up to a seven inch rain event , up to a hundred-@@ year storm .
this is what it will look like , fingers crossed , NYU willing .
but perhaps the most popular has been that we &apos;ve got another array of these boys in the Bronx River , where the first beaver -- crazy as he is -- to have moved in and built a lo@@ dge in New York in 250 years , hangs out .
and her mother behind her .
my mother had never stopped labor@@ ing for me , from my birth to my son &apos;s birth .
this was my third lesson in revolutionary love .
ready ?
I heard you were looking for me . &quot;
&quot; our conversation started with me saying , &apos; I &apos;m bored , &apos; and her replying , &apos; When I &apos;m bored I eat pretzels . &apos; I remember this distinctly because it came up a lot . &quot;
he died long after he left the pillow at my house , but we never got around to returning it . &quot;
a guy said that his daughter got scared at night and could I write a song for her , his daughter .
I said , &quot; Okay , I &apos;ll think about it . &quot;
but I also learned very soon thereafter that Jesus also said , and I &apos;m paraphr@@ asing , the poor would always be with us .
first and foremost , I learned about this new method of change in the world that , for once , showed me , maybe , a way to interact with someone and to give , to share of a resource in a way that wasn &apos;t weird and didn &apos;t make me feel bad -- that was exciting .
the fourth year , we were just short of 100 .
( Applause ) For me , the best way to be inspired to try is to stop and to listen to someone else &apos;s story .
then we would generate something all of us would like to have -- a balance between the hunger and the sati@@ ation .
how can we cook that we have this language developed ?
so I actually developed a proposal to go out with a cargo ship and two decom@@ mission@@ ed fishing traw@@ lers , a crane , a chi@@ pping machine and a cold-@@ molding machine .
and my intention was to go out to the gy@@ re , raise awareness about this issue and begin to pick up the plastic , chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks that could potentially be used as building materials in under@@ developed communities .
but this is no news , right ?
so this is really journalism in cartoons .
Thank you .

and of course , these feet are so designed that they can walk only on such perfect pavement or roads .
and therefore , the standard process , where you develop a molecule , put it into mice , into men , are not yiel@@ ding those results -- the billions of dollars that have been spent .
and that can come only from Gandhi@@ an engineering .
and the property of parallel lines is that they never meet .
anybody can play in the game .
so let me step back and ask : what &apos;s power ?
it &apos;s as though Mexico and Canada were hostile neighbors to the United States , which they &apos;re not .
I want to know why they fish .
so what do we call this ?
Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green .
we have eco-friendly shrimp .
Mr. Spock is a scientist as well , and at the same time , he &apos;s the first &#91; officer &#93; of the starship Enterprise , and during the adventures of the Enterprise crew , he and his colleagues are dealing a lot with the presence or absence of Mr. Spock &apos;s emotions .
and this is what I , as a chemist , have in mind when I think about them .
so of course , science should be based on facts and logic .
and biological pest control , by the way , or these &quot; good bugs &quot; that we are talking about , they &apos;ve existed in the world for thousands and thousands of years , for a long , long time .
so what do these three myths tell us then ?
I &apos;m also slightly in awe of them .
but the biggest neurological tur@@ n-@@ on for people is other people .
but again , those rewards could be calibrated so precisely if we were able to use the vast expertise of gaming systems to just jack up that appeal , to take the data , to take the observations , of millions of human hours and plow that feedback into increasing engagement .
but tell me where they are and the country that owns them . &quot;
and what &apos;s the context of the Phoenix Islands ?
we just had our first PIPA Trust Board meeting three weeks ago .
thanks a lot .
I want to stress that this is not just happening in the labs .
I hope organic photovoltaics will be a big part of this .
see , I &apos;ve been thinking about this for eight years now .
you can imagine in today &apos;s attention economy , we &apos;re competing against Facebook , Snapchat and Play@@ Station to try and get these students &apos; time .
you can see a lot more completing their homework than not .
because in the long run , the wonder of mathematics will be the incentive and understanding it will be the reward .
getting over heartbreak is hard , but if you refuse to be mis@@ led by your mind and you take steps to heal , you can significantly minimize your suffering .
so if you know someone who is heartbroken , have compassion , because social support has been found to be important for their recovery .
that &apos;s because unfairness triggers the primitive , rep@@ tile part of our brain , the part that deals with threats and survival , and when unfairness triggers a threat , that &apos;s all we can think about .
so our effort should be to filter out as much unfairness as we can from everywhere , starting from our communities , starting from our companies .
wouldn &apos;t it be cool to work in a company that was more fair ?
